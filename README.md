# police-brutality-data-analysis
In this project, we analyze the events after George Floyd’s death. The protests and riots across the United States and sentiments of news articles of three different news sources that have different political leaning. We will see how these media reacted after Floyd’s death and see the effect of media bias on the sentiments of news for #BlackLivesMatter and #AllLivesMatter movement. We will also see if there is a correlation between the police budget and the number of protests. This analysis will help us to see if there is really a need for defunding police to reduce police brutality and casualties. We will also see the correlation of partisan segregation and number of deaths to see if political preference has an effect on the number of deaths by police.
