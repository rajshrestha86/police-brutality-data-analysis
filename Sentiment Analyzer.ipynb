      "Headline:  This is how loved ones want us to remember George Floyd\n",
      "############\n",
      "Article:  (CNN)George Floyd moved to Minnesota for a fresh start — an opportunity to better himself and to be a better father. And while so many now know the Houston native by his full name, those who knew him best called him Floyd. He worked security at a restaurant where he developed a reputation as someone who had your back and was there for you when you were down. \"Knowing my brother is to love my brother,\" Philonise Floyd, George's brother, told CNN's Don Lemon. \"He's a gentle giant, he don't hurt anybody.\" Floyd, 46, died May 25 in the city he moved to for a better life, his last moments caught on video. While being arrested, Floyd was held down by a Minneapolis police officer's knee. The video shows Floyd pleading that he is in pain and can't breathe. Then, his eyes shut and the pleas stop. He was pronounced dead shortly after. That officer, Derek Chauvin, was arrested on Friday and first charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. The new second-degree murder charge says that Chauvin killed Floyd \"without intent\" in the course of committing assault in the third degree, according to an amended complaint. Thomas Lane and J. Alexander Kueng, who helped restrain Floyd, and Tou Thao, who stood near the others, were not initially charged. Lane, 37, Kueng, 26, and Thao, 34, are now charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter. He was a coachable kid with a big heart Floyd grew up in Houston's Third Ward neighborhood and graduated from Jack Yates High School where he played football and basketball, according to CNN affiliate KPRC. After high school, head basketball coach George Walker recruited Floyd to play for him at South Florida State College in Avon Park, Florida. Floyd was a student there from 1993 to 1995, Walker told CNN. \"He didn't give me too much trouble as a basketball coach,\" Walker said. \"He was a pretty good athlete, averaged 12 to 14 points a game.\" George Floyd #5, (left) with other teammates and his coach, George Walker (far right) Floyd was a coachable kid with a big heart, according to Walker's wife, Gloria. Of all the college athletes on the school's team, she said Floyd had her attention the most \"because he was just a fun person to be around.\" \"He was never one that tried to blame others for his own mistakes,\" she said. \"He always owned up to them and always tried to do better.\" He was trying to be a better father He moved to Minnesota for work and to drive trucks, according to friend and former NBA player, Stephen Jackson. Jackson, a Houston native also, calls Floyd his twin. \"I've heard George in the last couple days more than I've heard my whole life, and we had a 21-plus (year) relationship,\" Jackson told CNN's Poppy Harlow Thursday. \"His name was always Floyd, my twin.\" Floyd was known in the community as a protector and a provider who didn't have a hateful bone in his body, according to Jackson. He got along with everybody and seldom wanted anything in return for helping someone out, Jackson said. \"The difference between me and bro was I had more opportunity than he did,\" wrote Jackson, who won a championship with the San Antonio Spurs in 2003. \"2 things we have in common both from the bottom and both of our names will live forever.\" Once Floyd moved to Minnesota, Jackson said Floyd talked at great length about his journey to create better opportunities for himself. Minneapolis ex-officer who knelt on George Floyd's neck is in custody and charged with murder \"The last time i talked to him was about a year ago and every conversation we had in that year was about bettering ourselves and being better fathers,\" Jackson said. \"That's all he talked about.\" Floyd is a father to two daughters, the youngest is 6, according to Jackson. \"I want justice for his kids,\" he said. \"I want his kids to be taken care of. Their father is not here.\" Jackson vows to support his friend's children and \"fill in for Floyd\" and said he wants to make sure they are provided for. In Houston, Rose Hudson, who dated Floyd more than 20 years ago, told CNN affiliate KTRK that her and Floyd had a daughter who is now the mother of a toddler. \"My daughter had to see her daddy get killed on live TV,\" Hudson said. Floyd hadn't met his 3-year-old granddaughter, according to Hudson. \"I will just let her know what a great guy he was,\" she said.\"He was a good father to his girls. I just have memories, that's all I can give her, memories of her grandfather.\" Floyd worked security at Conga Latin Bistro in Minneapolis for five years, according to its owner, Jovanni Thunstrom. Even though he was Thunstrom's employee, the pair were also friends. \"He was loved by all my employees and my customers,\" Thunstrom told CNN. \"I was looking at the video and I said that can't be Floyd, but later it just blew out. It was Floyd. And that's when it hit me, it hit me hard,\" Thunstrom told CNN affiliate WCCO. Floyd would help clean up after the bar had closed and was a \"very nice guy and really good with customers,\" according to Thunstrom. \"He stood up for people, he was there for people when they were down, he loved people that were thrown away,\" Courteney Ross, Floyd's other half, told WCCO. \"We prayed over every meal, we prayed if we were having a hard time, we prayed if we were having a good time.\" People who didn't know Floyd are outraged, too Anger over Floyd's death goes beyond his family and friends. A number of celebrities have reacted to the incident on social media. NBA player LeBron James shared a side-by-side photo on Instagram. On one side you can see a screen grab from the encounter between Floyd and police. In the photo on the left a Minnesota police officer's knee can be seen on Floyd's neck. In the photo on the right is the image of San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick kneeling in protest during the national anthem for a preseason football game in 2016. At the time, Kaepernick had said he would not honor a song nor \"show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color.\" James' post is accompanied by the caption, \"Do you understand NOW!!??!!?? Or is it still blurred to you?? #StayWoke\" His family thinks police didn't do enough to help him The Minnesota National Guard activated more than 500 soldiers to the St. Paul, Minneapolis, and surrounding communities because of the increase in demonstrations in the area, according to a tweet Thursday night. Protests have occurred and are ongoing in cities like Minneapolis, St. Paul, Phoenix, Denver, Louisville, Memphis and Columbus. 4 Minneapolis cops fired after video shows one kneeling on neck of black man who later died Some of the protests have been peaceful, while others have been destructive. Though the four Minneapolis officers involved in Floyd's death were fired, his family members said that's not enough. They want to see all of the officers charged with murder. \"They were supposed to be there to serve and to protect and I didn't see a single one of them lift a finger to do anything to help while he was begging for his life. Not one of them tried to do anything to help him,\" Tera Brown, Floyd's cousin, told CNN's Lemon. Quincy Mason Floyd, Floyd's son, said, \"No man or woman should be without their fathers.\" \"We want justice for what's going on right now,\" he said. \"This is so emotional.\" CNN's Omar Jimenez, Christina Maxouris, Josh Campbell, Melissa Alonso, Ray Sanchez, Joe Sutton and Artemis Moshtaghian, contributed to this report\n",

We will listen and learn!#BlackLivesMattters pic.twitter.com/AYoYdY8IlX — Bubba Wallace (@BubbaWallace) June 7, 2020 Wallace's statements and tweets come as protests gather across the US and around the globe to call for police reform, especially when it comes to relations with black and brown communities. The protests were sparked by the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who died after a Minneapolis police officer placed his knee on Floyd's neck for over eight minutes. Other NASCAR drivers also spoke up Sunday. The legendary Jeff Gordon made a powerful statement during Sunday's broadcast saying he and Wallace's professional and personal journeys are different. \"I'll never know what it's like to walk in Bubba's shoes or the shoes of anyone that's experienced racism. I do know I can be better; we can do better to create positive change,\" Gordon said. \"We need to step up now more than we ever have in the past. We are listening. We are learning. We are ready for change.\" Daniel Suárez posted the NASCAR video discussing racism in solidarity with Wallace. \"We stand with you.

      "############\n",
      "Article:  Minneapolis (CNN)The Rev. Al Sharpton denounced racism and called for accountability in the criminal justice system as he delivered an eulogy Thursday for George Floyd. \"The reason we could never be who we wanted to be and dreamed of being is you kept your knee on our neck,\" said Sharpton, the founder of the National Action Network. Sharpton spoke near a casket carrying Floyd's body at the North Central University in Minneapolis. The event was the first in a series of memorial services honoring Floyd. Floyd's family was joined by dozens of guests, including civil rights leader Rev. Jesse Jackson, Democratic Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, Martin Luther King III and actor Kevin Hart. It was a time for Floyd's family to mourn a man who in his 46 years of life \"touched many hearts\" and whose death sparked momentum toward change within days. Al Sharpton announces new March on Washington led by families of black people killed by police \"What happened to Floyd happens every day in this country, in education, in health services, and in every area of American life,\" Sharpton said. \"It is time for us to stand up in George's name and say get your knee of our necks.\" Following his eulogy, Sharpton directed attendees to join him in silence for 8 minutes and 46 seconds -- the same amount of time than an officer held his knee on Floyd's neck while he was in custody. \"That's a long time, Sharpton said. \"That's how long he was laying there.\" 'We don't want two justice systems in America,' family attorney says Benjamin Crump, an attorney representing the Floyd family, called for equality, especially in the way black people are treated in the criminal justice system. \"We don't want two justice systems in America. One for black and one for white,\" Crump said. \"What we endeavor to achieve is equal gestures for the United States of America and George Floyd is the moment to give us the best opportunity I've seen in a long time of reaching that high idea that this country was founded on,\" he added. Hide Caption 53 of 53 Photos: Remembering George Floyd Pallbearers bring George Floyd's casket into the Fountain of Praise church in Houston on Tuesday, June 9. Floyd will be buried next to his mother, according to the Fort Bend Memorial Planning Center. Hide Caption 1 of 53 Although the final results of Floyd's autopsy revealed he had tested positive for coronavirus in April, Crump made clear that the virus had no role in Floyd's death. \"It was the other pandemic that we are way too familiar with in America, a pandemic of racism and discrimination that killed George Floyd,\" Crump said. Most attendees were seen wearing masks, including some of Floyd's relatives, whose masks had his photo on them. Earlier in the service, Scott Hagan, president of North Central University in Minneapolis, announced the creation a memorial scholarship in Floyd's name, and called for universities around the country to create similar funds. 'Everyone wants justice for George,' his brother says Anyone who met Floyd couldn't miss seeing him. He was 6 feet 4 inches tall, a \"gentle giant\" who made everyone feel welcome. Some of Floyd's siblings and other relatives shared moments of their life in Houston together. They would make banana and mayonnaise sandwiches, play football, and welcome other kids into their home, his brother Philonise Floyd said. Floyd's cousin Shareeduh Tate along with Floyd's brothers and a newpher spoke about him during Thursday's memorial. \"We didn't have a whole lot, but we always had each other,\" Floyd's cousin Shareeduh Tate said. \"And we were taught that we could always bring people into the fold. No one should ever go home without having a meal or having food.\" Since the 46-year-old died while in police custody in Minneapolis, Floyd's relatives have been part of massive protests in Texas. His children heard crowds far way from home chant their father's name. His brother led a prayer vigil at the site of Floyd's death. \"Everyone wants justice for George, we want justice for George,\" Philonise Floyd said. \"He's going to get it.\" Floyd was born in North Carolina but called Houston, Texas, home because he moved there at a young age with his family. He grew up in the city's Third Ward -- a historically black neighborhood -- and it was there where he played basketball, went to church and met many friends, including the mother of his 6-year-old daughter and former NBA player Stephen Jackson. This is how loved ones want us to remember George Floyd \"He didn't abuse our friendship, he cherished it,\" Jackson told CNN. \"Floyd was one person I knew that was supporting me genuinely.\" As a teenager, Floyd was known as a star athlete. He was a tight end on the football team and played basketball at Jack Yates High School. \"Mr. Floyd was a '93 Yates graduate, an amazing athlete, and a dear friend to many,\" Tiffany Guillory, the school's principal tweeted last week. He left home for a few years to play basketball at South Florida State College in Avon Park, Florida, the team's head basketball coach George Walker told CNN. \"He didn't give me too much trouble as a basketball coach,\" Walker said. \"He was a pretty good athlete, averaged 12 to 14 points a game.\" Floyd moved to Minneapolis several years ago looking for a better life. He worked as a truck driver and more recently as a bouncer at a club. He wanted to be a better father, Jackson said, and would often talk about taking care of his daughters. Floyd will be honored in North Carolina and Houston People in two other cities will be able to pay their respects in the next five days. A public viewing and a private memorial service will be held in Raeford, North Carolina, on Saturday -- the state where he was born. Floyd's sister lives in Hoke County, according to CNN affiliate WRAL. George Floyd's memorial and funeral services will take place in Minneapolis, Houston and North Carolina The public viewing will be from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. at Cape Fear Conference B Headquarters, followed by a private service for family at 3 p.m., said Hoke County Sheriff Hubert Peterkin. Next Monday, Floyd's body will return to Houston for a public memorial and private service on Tuesday. The memorial will take place from noon to 6 p.m. at The Fountain of Praise Church at 13950 Hillcroft Ave. in Houston, the Fort Bend Memorial Planning Center said. The private service will be held at an undisclosed location. All four ex-police officers charged The four fired Minneapolis police officers who had been arresting Floyd are now in jail. New charges were filed Wednesday against the officers. Derek Chauvin, who knelt on Floyd's neck for nearly 9 minutes, was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter last week and authorities added a charge of second-degree murder. All four former officers involved in George Floyd's killing now face charges The other former officers -- J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao -- face charges of aiding and abetting second-degree murder and aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter. If convicted, all officers could spend up to 40 years in prison. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said the new charges were not influenced by the public outcry in the case nor the fact that a public memorial is scheduled for Floyd on Thursday. After learning the officers had been charged, Floyd's son Quincy Mason told CNN's Sara Sidner that his family wants justice. \"I'm here with my family. We demand justice. My father shouldn't have been killed like this,\" he said.\n",

      "############\n",
      "Article:  (CNN)A newly minted mural celebrating the life of George Floyd has become a vigil in his hometown and has even attracted the attention of Houston police officers. The mural was painted by the Houston area artist Donkeeboy on the side of Scott Food Mart on Tuesday. It depicts a black and white portrait of Floyd wearing angel wings against a bright blue background. Above him is a yellow halo that reads, \"Forever breathing in our hearts.\" The 46-year-old father died in Minneapolis last week after then-officer Derek Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds. Visitors had already left flowers and candles at the bottom of the mural to remember the life that was lost. Two Houston officers told CNN on Wednesday that they wanted to visit the mural to \"pay our respects.\" It started with a direct message on Instagram The artist told CNN that the idea of the memorial painting started when one of Floyd's friends reached out to him on Instagram asking for a mural to remember Floyd. Donkeeboy said he and his mom, who are a painting team, were finishing another job when they got the request. They immediately headed over to the site to start working on it. \"I was honored that I was asked by members of his community, and friends of his... at the same time I wish I wasn't doing it,\" Donkeeboy said. \"It was something that was very hard to do ... when I was painting his face, I kept replaying the video in my head.\" The point is to keep Floyd's memory alive The artist said that the whole point of the mural is to keep Floyd alive and to keep others speaking his name. He wants to use what happened to bring a positive image to other people. \"I want his image and his name to be remembered. I want people to visit the mural site especially because that is where he came from,\" Donkeeboy said. He said that the imagery of the painting is significant. Donkeeboy said that he painted Floyd's portrait without color because the situation is black and white, and he doesn't think people should see color. Donkeeboy also said that he was originally going to keep Floyd's shirt blank, until some of Floyd's friends told him that they remember him wearing shirts that said the word \"Ghetto,\" so he decided to include the word to honor their memories. Donkeeboy encourages artists everywhere to start painting Floyd's image so he won't be forgotten. \"Art is so powerful, and art is as powerful as you want it to be,\" he said. \"People need to see it and walk through it on their way to work or on their way home. ... We need to put his image everywhere so people can remember ... that's George Floyd.\"\n",

      "Article:  (CNN)It started with a routine police call reporting someone used a counterfeit bill at a store in Minneapolis. Prosecutors say 'justice will be served' in George Floyd's death What followed was a series of events that ended with George Floyd, 46, dead after a white police officer used his knee to pin him down in an incident captured on video.

      "Headline:  Baseball is making Black Lives Matter center stage on Opening Day\n",
      "############\n",
      "Article:  (CNN)America's pastime is sending a loud message as it begins its condensed season: Black lives matter. For decades, fans have claimed baseball often mirrors society and in 2020, that rings true -- and loudly. (Photo by Alex Trautwig/MLB Photos via Getty Images) Opening Day should normally bring fans, awakening from winter hibernation, to ballpark grandstands adorned with American flag bunting. Covid-19 means those major league ballparks are largely silent, save for the crack of a bat -- there are no fans in the stands. But Major League Baseball, teams and players are also using this Opening Day to place Black Lives Matters center stage. \"BLM,\" accompanied by the MLB's logo, has been stamped onto the pitcher's mound of the World Series-defending Washington Nationals --and the Los Angeles Dodgers -- on Thursday night. That's the most prominently displayed ballpark location during a television broadcast. On Friday morning, the Tampa Bay Rays sent a tweet, saying, \"Today is Opening Day, which means it's a great day to arrest the killers of Breonna Taylor.\" The Boston Red Sox endorsed the message, retweeting it to their 2.1 million followers. The left sleeve of some of the four teams player jerseys -- the Nationals, New York Yankees, Los Angeles Dodgers and San Francisco Giants -- have patches reading, \"Black Lives Matter\" and \"United for Change,\" alongside what the MLB says is an, \"inverted MLB logo where the silhouetted batter is black.\" (Photo by Alex Trautwig/MLB Photos via Getty Images) It's first time that logo has been used on the field. Both the Nationals and Yankees players came to the field during pre-game batting practice in shirts reading, \"Black Lives Matter.\" On the West Coast, the Los Angeles Dodgers posted a tweet showing Kenley Jansen, Edwin Rios, Kike Hernandez, Matt Beaty and Corey Seager wearing Black Lives Matter shirts ahead of their game against the San Francisco Giants at Dodger Stadium. Prior to the playing of the National Anthem, teams took to the field and held a black ribbon-like fabric and kneeled -- every player and coach. \"Today, and every day, we come together as brothers,\" actor Morgan Freeman read as players knelt. \"As equals, all with the same goal -- to level the playing field. To change the injustices. Equality is not just a word. It's our right.\" It's all part of a new policy from the MLB, according to a document obtained by CNN, drafted after the league held discussions with the Players Association, the Players Alliance and individual players. \"MLB stands in solidarity with the Black community in the fight for racial and social justice,\" the document reads. \"MLB recognizes more needs to be done. MLB will continue to listen to the Black community including MLB players, The Players Alliance and MLB and Club staff about this issue; enhance initiatives to improve Black representation in baseball on and off-the-field; expand charitable donations to social justice organizations; and continue to amplify the voices of our players.\" The league has also reversed its policy on messages written on player cleats. According to the document, players will now be able to, \"express themselves with social justice messages and causes,\" during the 2020 season. Baseball may have been one of the first professional sports leagues to integrate, but it continues to reckon with the racism of its past. For decades, Major League Baseball owners colluded to prevent the signing of any Black players, who ended up forming their own leagues commonly known as the Negro Leagues. That changed in 1946, when Brooklyn Dodgers owner and general manager Branch Rickey signed Negro Leaguer Jackie Robinson, who became the first Black major leaguer in 1947. In late June, the Minnesota Twins removed a statue honoring Calvin Griffith from outside the team's ballpark. Griffith had once said to a crowd he'd moved his baseball team from Washington to Minneapolis because they had fewer Black people. CNN's Jill Martin and Wayne L. Sterling contributed to this report.\n",

      "Article:  (CNN)When Marjorie Alston attended a Black Lives Matter protest in North Carolina with her boyfriend, she went carrying a sign but left wearing a ring on her finger. In the midst of marching, chanting and uniting with fellow protesters, 26-year-old Xavier Young got down on one knee and asked Alston to be his wife. \"I had no idea I would propose at the protest,\" Young told CNN. \"But when we decided to go, I threw the ring in my bag along with protest gear. When things slowed down a bit, I made it seem like I was grabbing some water, pulled out the ring, and asked her to marry me.\" Newly engaged couple Xavier Young and Marjorie Alston. Photographer Charles Crouch was at the protest in Raleigh on May 30 and captured the heartwarming moment in what he called \"divine timing.\" After the proposal, he and the couple ended up becoming friends. Alston, 23, who is four months pregnant with the couple's first child, said she knew Young would find a bold way to propose to her. But when he did it at the protest, she was completely shocked -- and immediately said yes. \"I wasn't really expecting this, but I loved it. It was very sweet and memorable. I know I will remember the moment forever,\" Alston said.

The newly engaged couple were protesting police brutality and racial injustice, along with many others who've taken to the streets across the United States since May 25, when a Minneapolis police officer killed George Floyd, an unarmed black man, by kneeling on his neck. Young said he hopes the proposal brought something beautiful to an otherwise difficult and painful time. \"It's important for black people, people who look like Marjorie and I, to see images of black love amid everything that's going on and happening recently,\" he said. \"Black lives matter and black love matters because with our love we can heal each other and begin to address the trauma of being black in America.\" After the sweet proposal, the two got back up and continued protesting, something they plan to keep doing until there is change.\n",

      "Article:  (CNN)Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau took a knee during a Black Lives Matter demonstration in Ottawa on Friday. Trudeau's act of solidarity comes after he declined to comment earlier in the day about whether he would be attending the protest. Still, he arrived at Parliament Hill -- home to Canada's Parliament -- wearing a black cloth mask Friday afternoon and surrounded by security guards, according to CNN affiliate CTVnews. Trudeau did not speak at the event, though he clapped and nodded along with some of the other speakers, including a moment when a speaker asserted there is no middle ground on racism. At another point, he yelled \"Amen\" along with other protesters after a speaker discussed promoting love and justice. Some in the crowd shouted at him to stand up to US President Donald Trump, CTVnews reported. Though many celebrities have been outspoken about their support for protesters in the US, support from world leaders has been muted, despite global protests featuring the Black Lives Matter slogan. On Monday, the Canadian leader paused for nearly 20 seconds when asked about the President, looking visibly uncomfortable before side-stepping the question. Washington DC paints a giant 'Black Lives Matter' message on the road to the White House Friday's protest was organized by No Peace Until Justice as part of a slew of protests against police brutality and systemic racism around the world following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The crowd had a moment of silence for almost nine minutes -- the amount of time former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin kept his knee pressed on Floyd's neck. During this silence, many took a knee, too. Trudeau joined them. The Ottawa Police Service told CTVnews in a statement the march was peaceful. \"We respect the rights of our residents and community members to speak out when they see injustices and we understand the community's deep pain and frustration,\" they said. \"Our role is to provide a safe space for people to grieve and be heard.\" Ottawa Public Health asked attendees to wash their hands, clean their belongings and put their clothes in the wash, all to help minimize the spread of the coronavirus.\n",

Over the course of two weeks, Kerry Anne asked 21 of her and Michael's immediate family members to join them in the courtyard of The Logan Hotel. Even though the hotel has closed its doors because of the pandemic, they offered up their courtyard for a small ceremony, Kerry Anne said. When Kerry Anne found out that the weekend's Black Lives Matter protests were set to take place close to her wedding location, she was conflicted because she said she wanted to take part in them but knew she wanted to kick off this new chapter in her life with Michael. The plan for the couple to see each other for the first time was always meant to take place on the corner of the hotel, according to Kerry Anne. She said when she walked outside to meet Michael, she was initially alone and away from protesters. By the time Michael began his walk to meet her, the demonstrators had marched closer and closer to her. Eventually, they moved in around her and started cheering and clapping as Michael made his way to greet her. Linda McQueen, the couple's wedding photographer, told CNN protestors were chanting \"Black Lives Matter\" and \"Black Love Matters\" as they gathered around the couple with their bright colored, handmade signs. McQueen has photographed hundreds of weddings in her career but said The Gordons' wedding will always have a special place in her heart. \"Witnessing thousands of people, from different cultures, races and creeds, all unite in encouraging this couple on their union...I got so emotional that it brought me to tears as I photographed this epic moment.\" Kerry Anne wrote her vows for Michael five months prior to their wedding day and said she had not looked at them since. She said she wrote about how Michael was the perfect example of what a black man is and should be. \"To know that we are in a movement right now, that we are here for a bigger cause, it really touched my heart and my soul,\" she said. \"It reflected on everything historically, going back hundreds of years ago and really bring us to this moment where I can say, I can stand next to him and say I'm proud. I'm proud of this black man, my black man.\"\n",

      "Article:  (CNN)Jason Mraz is honoring Juneteenth by donating all of the profits from his new album to Black Lives Matter and other organizations working toward equality and justice. The two-time Grammy winner released \"Look For The Good\" on Friday, the same day that African-Americans celebrate the black community's emancipation from slavery in the United States. \"On June 19th, a historic day in the advancement of equality, I am proud to stand in solidarity with and be of service to Black Lives by donating all of my earnings from sales and streams of my new LP recording, Look For The Good,\" Mraz tweeted. Juneteenth has received increased attention in the wake of nationwide protests against police brutality and racial injustice, sparked by the death of George Floyd at the hands of the police in Minneapolis. The self-proclaimed \"Geek in the Pink\" will immediately start by donating his $250,000 advance on royalties, he said in a news release. The first six organizations to receive a portion of his donation are Black Lives Matter, San Diego Young Artists Music Academy, RISE San Diego, Grassroots Law Project, Center on Policy Initiatives, and the Equal Justice Initiative. \"I am announcing my contributions publicly in hopes of inspiring other creators and leaders in business to do the same -- to share the wealth, to share the profits, and to acknowledge that life is only great when it's great for everyone,\" Mraz said. Every year, the artist will choose various organizations that work on advancing \"equality and justice\" to receive donations from the album's profits.\n",

      "Article:  (CNN)America's pastime is sending a loud message as it begins its condensed season: Black lives matter. For decades, fans have claimed baseball often mirrors society and in 2020, that rings true -- and loudly. (Photo by Alex Trautwig/MLB Photos via Getty Images) Opening Day should normally bring fans, awakening from winter hibernation, to ballpark grandstands adorned with American flag bunting. Covid-19 means those major league ballparks are largely silent, save for the crack of a bat -- there are no fans in the stands. But Major League Baseball, teams and players are also using this Opening Day to place Black Lives Matters center stage. \"BLM,\" accompanied by the MLB's logo, has been stamped onto the pitcher's mound of the World Series-defending Washington Nationals --and the Los Angeles Dodgers -- on Thursday night. That's the most prominently displayed ballpark location during a television broadcast. On Friday morning, the Tampa Bay Rays sent a tweet, saying, \"Today is Opening Day, which means it's a great day to arrest the killers of Breonna Taylor.\" Today is Opening Day, which means it's a great day to arrest the killers of Breonna Taylor — Tampa Bay Rays (@RaysBaseball) July 24, 2020 The Boston Red Sox endorsed the message, retweeting it to their 2.1 million followers. The left sleeve of some of the four teams player jerseys -- the Nationals, New York Yankees, Los Angeles Dodgers and San Francisco Giants -- have patches reading, \"Black Lives Matter\" and \"United for Change,\" alongside what the MLB says is an, \"inverted MLB logo where the silhouetted batter is black.\" (Photo by Alex Trautwig/MLB Photos via Getty Images) It's first time that logo has been used on the field. Both the Nationals and Yankees players came to the field during pre-game batting practice in shirts reading, \"Black Lives Matter.\" On the West Coast, the Los Angeles Dodgers posted a tweet showing Kenley Jansen, Edwin Rios, Kike Hernandez, Matt Beaty and Corey Seager wearing Black Lives Matter shirts ahead of their game against the San Francisco Giants at Dodger Stadium. Prior to the playing of the National Anthem, teams took to the field and held a black ribbon-like fabric and kneeled -- every player and coach. \"Today, and every day, we come together as brothers,\" actor Morgan Freeman read as players knelt. \"As equals, all with the same goal -- to level the playing field. To change the injustices. Equality is not just a word. It's our right.\" It's all part of a new policy from the MLB, according to a document obtained by CNN, drafted after the league held discussions with the Players Association, the Players Alliance and individual players. \"MLB stands in solidarity with the Black community in the fight for racial and social justice,\" the document reads. \"MLB recognizes more needs to be done. MLB will continue to listen to the Black community including MLB players, The Players Alliance and MLB and Club staff about this issue; enhance initiatives to improve Black representation in baseball on and off-the-field; expand charitable donations to social justice organizations; and continue to amplify the voices of our players.\" The league has also reversed its policy on messages written on player cleats. According to the document, players will now be able to, \"express themselves with social justice messages and causes,\" during the 2020 season. Baseball may have been one of the first professional sports leagues to integrate, but it continues to reckon with the racism of its past. For decades, Major League Baseball owners colluded to prevent the signing of any Black players, who ended up forming their own leagues commonly known as the Negro Leagues. That changed in 1946, when Brooklyn Dodgers owner and general manager Branch Rickey signed Negro Leaguer Jackie Robinson, who became the first Black major leaguer in 1947. In late June, the Minnesota Twins removed a statue honoring Calvin Griffith from outside the team's ballpark. Griffith had once said to a crowd he'd moved his baseball team from Washington to Minneapolis because they had fewer Black people. CNN's Jill Martin and Wayne L. Sterling contributed to this report.\n",

      "############\n",
      "Article:  (CNN)Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau took a knee during a Black Lives Matter demonstration in Ottawa on Friday. Trudeau's act of solidarity comes after he declined to comment earlier in the day about whether he would be attending the protest. Still, he arrived at Parliament Hill -- home to Canada's Parliament -- wearing a black cloth mask Friday afternoon and surrounded by security guards, according to CNN affiliate CTVnews. Trudeau did not speak at the event, though he clapped and nodded along with some of the other speakers, including a moment when a speaker asserted there is no middle ground on racism. At another point, he yelled \"Amen\" along with other protesters after a speaker discussed promoting love and justice. Some in the crowd shouted at him to stand up to US President Donald Trump, CTVnews reported. Though many celebrities have been outspoken about their support for protesters in the US, support from world leaders has been muted, despite global protests featuring the Black Lives Matter slogan. On Monday, the Canadian leader paused for nearly 20 seconds when asked about the President, looking visibly uncomfortable before side-stepping the question. Washington DC paints a giant 'Black Lives Matter' message on the road to the White House Friday's protest was organized by No Peace Until Justice as part of a slew of protests against police brutality and systemic racism around the world following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The crowd had a moment of silence for almost nine minutes -- the amount of time former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin kept his knee pressed on Floyd's neck. During this silence, many took a knee, too. Trudeau joined them. The Ottawa Police Service told CTVnews in a statement the march was peaceful. \"We respect the rights of our residents and community members to speak out when they see injustices and we understand the community's deep pain and frustration,\" they said. \"Our role is to provide a safe space for people to grieve and be heard.\" Ottawa Public Health asked attendees to wash their hands, clean their belongings and put their clothes in the wash, all to help minimize the spread of the coronavirus.\n",

      "############\n",
      "Article:  (CNN)A week after New York City painted a \"Black Lives Matter\" mural on a Manhattan street, groups associated with the pro-police movement \"Blue Lives Matter\" say they want one of their own. Police advocacy groups Blue Lives Matter NYC and Standing Up for NYC have teamed up to call on NYC Mayor Bill De Blasio to paint a street mural near the New York Police Department headquarters at One Police Plaza. The idea for a \"Blue Lives Matter\" mural was inspired by the \"Black Lives Matter\" mural that was painted on Fifth Avenue in front of Trump Tower, Blue Lives Matter NYC founder Joe Imperatrice told CNN, and would help bring attention to the dangers that police officers face every day on the street. \"I think it was a positive form of action which will give people from all walks of life an option to express themselves and bring to light issues we as a nation need to come together to fix,\" Imperatrice said of the inspiration. \"The 'Blue Lives Matter' mural would raise awareness for both the physical and verbal abuse officers endure daily. It would also be a way to remember our fallen heroes who have lost their lives defending their cities,\" Imperatrice said. \"Just as Black Lives Matter wants to bring attention to a subject, which they should, as are we.\" The Blue Lives Matter organization, a loosely affiliated group of police officers and their supporters, emerged as a counter-movement to the Black Lives Matter movement after the 2014 killings of NYPD officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu. It has inspired some state-level legislation meant to make law enforcement a protected class under hate crime laws. Those bills were criticized in 2018 by the NAACP, ACLU and others as a \"political response\" to national calls for police reform. New York City paints Black Lives Matter mural outside Trump Tower in Manhattan De Blasio approved \"Black Lives Matter\" street mural and he even participated in painting a small portion of it after President Trump tweeted that the mural would be \"denigrating\" Fifth Avenue. \"President Trump said we would be denigrating the luxury of Fifth Avenue,\" De Blasio said in response to Trump's tweet. \"Let me tell you: we're not denigrating anything, we are liberating Fifth Avenue, we are uplifting Fifth Avenue.\" The Black Lives Matter organization, the Mayor's office and the NYPD did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNN.

      "Article:  (CNN)A Minneapolis park got a name change over the weekend to honor George Floyd. Park officials don't know who put a decal on the sign at George Todd Park to change it to George Floyd Park, but they were impressed by the craftsmanship. The sticker used the same font as the real sign and the color matched almost perfectly. \"I do not know who put the decal up but I commend whoever it was for their creativity and detailed work,\" Minneapolis Park & Recreation Board (MPRB) President Jono Cowgill said in a statement. The park is about 2.5 miles from the spot where George Floyd was killed in police custody. Minneapolis schools and parks cut ties with police over George Floyd's death The decal was put up sometime on Saturday night and officials found out about it the next morning, MPRB spokeswoman Dawn Sommers told CNN. The park board decided to leave the sticker, but a worker removed it Monday morning by mistake. \"Unfortunately, one of our early morning weekday crew members was unaware of the directive and removed the decal Monday morning. The decal was unsalvageable and could not be re-adhered,\" Sommers said. The park was named for George Todd, who served as a park commissioner from 1957 to 1963, according to the MPRB website. He died of cancer a few months after he was honored. Sommers said she is not aware of any formal requests to officially name a park after Floyd, but Cowgill has expressed support for the idea.\n",

      "############\n",
      "Article:  (CNN)The former Minneapolis police officer charged with killing George Floyd and the three other officers accused of aiding and abetting in his death appeared in court on Monday for a pretrial hearing. Derek Chauvin, who is charged with second-degree murder in Floyd's death on May 25, appeared remotely via video, wearing an orange uniform and a mask. J. Alexander Kueng, Tou Thao and Thomas Lane, who are each charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter, appeared in person. Much of the hearing centered on public comments that have been made about the state's criminal investigation by government officials since the arrest of the four former officers, that defense lawyers say could prevent them from having a fair trial. Robert Paule, the attorney for Thao, criticized President Donald Trump, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the state's attorney general, and Minneapolis city officials over their public statements about the ongoing criminal investigation, claiming publicity by government officials has been prejudicial against his client. Paule also made an allegation against the Floyd family's legal team, indicating they had leaked information to the press that had been privately briefed to them by the Minnesota attorney general's office. Asked about the allegations Monday evening on CNN's \"Erin Burnett Out Front,\" Benjamin Crump, an attorney for the Floyd family, denied Paule's claims of media leaks. \"I don't believe anybody on our legal team has leaked any information,\" Crump said, but he defended the public disclosure of details in the case sought by the media and others. \"The truth of the matter is that there is so much information that has been divulged on this case that everybody, Erin, you all at CNN and all the other media companies are trying to get information,\" Crump said. \"It is important to be transparent. If you're not transparent, and we don't have accountability, we continue to have mistrust. ... At the end of the day, I'm sorry, Black people are losing our lives and everybody else is trying to play technicalities. No, we can't accept that.\" At Monday's hearing, Judge Peter Cahill said he did not want attorneys or officials to make comments about the merits of the case, possible evidence, or guilt or innocence in public, although he did not issue a formal gag order. Cahill admonished both the prosecution and the defense to ensure anyone they have sway over cease any further improper public comment. The judge also offered a stern warning, indicating that any further inappropriate public statements about the case could result in a change of venue to a location other than Minneapolis. Cahill said they are targeting the dates of September 11 to hold another hearing and March 8, 2021 to begin trial. Chauvin's bail was set at $1.25 million or $1 million under certain conditions, while bail for Kueng, Thao and Lane was set at $1 million each or $750,000 under certain conditions. Chauvin, 44, and Thao, 34, remain in custody, and Lane, 37, and Kueng, 26, have been released on conditional bond. The hearing comes more than a month after Floyd was killed while in police custody in Minneapolis. Chauvin pinned Floyd to the ground and pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for nearly eight minutes as Floyd pleaded \"I can't breathe.\" Lane and Kueng helped restrain Floyd, while Thao stood nearby. What we know about the four ex-police officers charged in George Floyd's death Autopsies by the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's office and by an independent autopsy commissioned by the family both concluded Floyd's death was a homicide, although they differ on what caused it. The police killing, captured on bystander video, sparked worldwide protests against racism and police brutality as part of the \"Black Lives Matter\" movement, and about two-thirds of Americans say they support the protests. Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo fired all four officers and has called Floyd's death \"murder.\" \"Mr. George Floyd's tragic death was not due to a lack of training -- the training was there. Chauvin knew what he was doing,\" Arradondo said in a statement. \"The officers knew what was happening -- one intentionally caused it and the others failed to prevent it. This was murder -- it wasn't a lack of training,\" he said. Chauvin had been a police officer with Minneapolis Police Department for nearly 19 years. Kueng was on his third shift as an officer, Lane had been on the police force for four days and Thao had been an MPD officer since 2012.\n",

      "Article:  (CNN)Surveillance video from outside a Minneapolis restaurant appears to contradict police claims that George Floyd resisted arrest before an officer knelt on his neck. Floyd's death this week sparked protests across the country after video emerged that shows the 46-year-old black man handcuffed and on the ground saying, \"I can't breathe,\" as a police officer holds him down with a knee on his neck. Parts of Minneapolis burn after George Floyd's death sparks heated protests All four officers involved in the incident have been fired from the Minneapolis Police Department. The officer who knelt on Floyd, Derek Chauvin, was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter, according to Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman. Earlier this week, police said in a statement they were responding to an alleged forgery Monday evening and that Floyd \"physically resisted officers.\" But surveillance footage from the nearby Dragon Wok restaurant shows the first point of contact between Floyd and officers. While there are several minutes where Floyd's interactions cannot be seen from the camera's vantage point, the footage does not appear to support the assertion that Floyd resisted arrest. In the video, two officers approach Floyd and two passengers in a vehicle parked outside the restaurant, located across the street from a convenience store where the alleged fraud occurred. Officers appear to handcuff Floyd, though the exchange is partially hidden behind the vehicle. Floyd appears to fall before an officer lifts him up and leads him onto the sidewalk, where Floyd sits down against a wall. These are the images of George Floyd you should see Eventually, the officer helps Floyd to his feet before both officers escort Floyd across the street to their SUV. Floyd appears to fall again before a second police vehicle blocks the view of the surveillance camera. At no point in the video does Floyd appear to struggle against the officers. Police said in their statement this week that officers \"noted (Floyd) appeared to be suffering medical distress\" and called an ambulance. Floyd was declared dead at a hospital a short time later, police said. Minneapolis police have yet to release bodycam footage from the officers involved. When asked about the apparent discrepancy between the surveillance footage and the police claim that Floyd resisted arrest, the MPD referred CNN to the FBI and Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. The Minneapolis Park Police -- a separate agency from the Minneapolis Police Department -- released heavily redacted bodycam footage from an officer who responded to the scene, but the officer was not facing the direction of the incident when it happened. 'Officer, he's not resisting arrest' The police account has also been contradicted by at least one witness, Donald Williams, who told CNN he was about to walk into a store when he saw Floyd \"panting for his life.\" Williams said he heard Floyd telling officers that he couldn't breathe. When Williams asked police what was happening, he said he was told Floyd was \"resisting arrest.\" Witness gets emotional recounting George Floyd arrest 02:00 \"I said, 'officer, he's not resisting arrest, you have your knee on him and you have handcuffs on him, he's detained at this moment,'\" Williams said. Rashad West -- who owns the Dragon Wok restaurant released the video along with another man, Jared Brewington -- who also disputed claims that Floyd resisted arrest. \"Did not see any resistance, not at all,\" West told CNN's Don Lemon on Wednesday night of the surveillance video. Brewington, whose business preceded West's at the same location, agreed that he did not see Floyd resisting arrest. CNN's Christina Maxouris contributed to this report.\n",

      "Article:  (CNN)Video posted on social media appears to show three Minneapolis Police Department officers kneeling on George Floyd during his arrest. Previous video from eyewitness Darnella Frazier showed Floyd, 46, being knelt on by one officer -- Derek Chauvin. CNN has not been able to locate the person who shot the latest video. That video shows the other side of the Minneapolis police vehicle where the arrest occurred. The video appears to show Chauvin and two other officers kneeling on Floyd. A screengrab from the new video, appearing to show three officers kneeling on George Floyd. \"I can't breathe, man,\" Floyd can be heard saying in the video. \"Please, let me stand. Please, man.\" Chauvin was taken into custody on Friday afternoon, according to the Minnesota Department of Public Safety, charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter, according to Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman. On June 3, Chauvin was charged with a new, more serious count of second-degree murder. The other three officers -- J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao -- were charged June 3 with aiding and abetting second-degree murder, and aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter. CNN has reached out to Chauvin's attorney and the Minneapolis police union for comment. Four officers were involved in the incident and all have since been fired from the Minneapolis Police Department. CNN has reached out to the Minneapolis police for comment, and to verify the video's authenticity, but has not received a response. Floyd was arrested after he allegedly used a counterfeit bill at a convenience store, police have said. Outrage grew after the first video surfaced showing a Minneapolis police officer kneeling on Floyd's neck. The 46-year-old, who was unarmed and handcuffed, died after the arrest. CNN has also reached out to Floyd family attorney Ben Crump about the video but has not yet received a response. NBC News previously reported an 18-second portion of the video but CNN has obtained a minute-long version of that video. Minneapolis police said in a statement earlier this week that officers had been responding to an alleged forgery on Monday evening and that during the arrest, Floyd \"physically resisted\" them. However, surveillance footage from the nearby Dragon Wok restaurant does not appear to support the claim that Floyd resisted arrest during the initial encounter. However, there are several minutes where Floyd's and the officers interactions cannot be seen from the camera's vantage point. This latest video appears to have been taken before the Frazier video, but after that surveillance video.\n",

      "Headline:  All Lives Matter protesters re-enacted George Floyd's death as a Black Lives Matter march went by\n",
      "############\n",
      "Article:  (CNN)A New Jersey corrections officer was suspended and a FedEx worker fired after two All Lives Matter demonstrators mockingly re-enacted George Floyd's death on Monday to apparently counter a Black Lives Matter march in Franklinville, New Jersey. The moment was videotaped by several people from both sides of the protest and posted on social media. \"Black lives matter to no one,\" shouts one apparent All Lives Matter protester. The entire incident lasted one minute and 23 seconds, according to video posted to social media that CNN has obtained. The video appears to have been taken by an All Lives Matter protester and shows what was happening before and after the Black Lives Matter march passed by. Minneapolis Police chief says officers' lack of experience is no excuse in George Floyd killing About 20 seconds before the police cars escorting the Black Lives Matter march reach the All Lives Matter protesters, a man lies prone on the ground. Shortly after that, another man kneels on his neck, and the re-enactment of Floyd's death begins. Other eyewitness videos, taken by Black Lives Matters marchers, pick up what happened next. \"I felt something was happening because the officers began shifting us to the opposite side of the street as we marched closer to that area,\" Russell Sampson, a Black Lives Matter marcher, told CNN. Ten seconds after the escorting police cars roll by, when the marchers approach, the kneeling man starts shouting at them. \"You don't comply, that's what happens,\" he screams, gesturing at the protesters to the person underneath him. \"Look ... he didn't comply! He didn't comply. If he would have complied, that wouldn't have happened.\" The organizer of the Black Lives Matter protest in Franklinville, Daryan Fennal, told CNN she was brought to tears seeing the re-enactment. \"I saw mothers trying to cover their children's eyes,\" she told CNN in a statement. \"Racism is everywhere, but to put it on display in such a gruesome and public way was what surprised me.\" After the protesters pass by, the man taking the video then begins commenting on the Black Lives Matter marchers. \"Blacks lives matter to no one,\" he is heard saying in the video. \"All lives matter. All lives matter. Police lives matter. God bless the police. God bless the police. You dumbass protesters.\" Corrections officer suspended, FedEx employee fired The re-enactment drew quick criticism as the videos were shared widely on social media. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy condemned the behavior, saying that \"mocking\" Floyd's murder to, \"belittle the calls for justice from our black and brown communities is repugnant.\" After the videos surfaced and outrage grew online, the New Jersey Department of Corrections said it had suspended an officer it says was, \"participating in the filming of a hateful and disappointing video that mocked the killing of George Floyd.\" 'Stop the pain': George Floyd's brother calls on lawmakers to overhaul policing laws The department has also begun a \"thorough and expedited\" investigation into the officer. A source familiar with the situation tells CNN the suspended officer is Joseph DeMarco, who has been employed by NJDOC for at least 18 years. The source said that after having \"a conversation\" with his union on Tuesday, DeMarco retained a private attorney. DeMarco was to be interviewed by NJDOC internal affairs on Wednesday morning, according to the source. A hearing will be held after internal affairs makes their recommendation and then it will be decided whether DeMarco is suspended with or without pay, the source says. Multiple calls by CNN to DeMarco have not been returned. Local union President William Sullivan told CNN the union -- which represents approximately 6,000 correctional police officers in New Jersey -- was made aware of the incident around 12:30 p.m. on Tuesday after \"a lot of officers called in and were upset.\" \"We need to continue practicing tolerance and understanding; not discrimination and hate,\" the union said in a statement on their Facebook page. \"As a collective group, we pray for those who are hurting and we are here to help each and every one of them heal.\" In a statement, FedEx said it has fired one employee it it allegedly saw in the video at the protest. \"FedEx holds its team members to a high standards of personal conduct, and we do not tolerate the kind of appalling and offensive behavior depicted in this video. The individual involved is no longer employed by FedEx. We stand with those who support justice and equality,\" reads the statement. CNN continues to try to reach the former FedEx employee for comment, as well as the suspended corrections officer. But Daryann Fennal, the Black Lives Matter organizer, says this won't take away from her efforts. She says she can't \"unsee\" the re-enactment and calls it scary and terrifying. \"Despite the horrible incident we witnessed, I remain hopeful for the future and I hope we at least reached one person's heart yesterday,\" she said. CNN's Alta Spells, Taylor Romine and Lauren del Valle contributed to this report.\n",

      "Article:  (CNN)The Black Lives Matter street mural outside Trump Tower was vandalized with red paint, police confirmed to CNN on Monday. An unnamed suspect walked up to the mural, dumped red paint over the letter V in \"Lives,\" and ran away as passing traffic further splattered the paint across the sign, New York Police Department officials said. President Donald Trump previously called the words \"Black Lives Matter\" a \"symbol of hate,\" and criticized New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio for \"denigrating\" the area. NYC is cutting Police $'s by ONE BILLION DOLLARS, and yet the @NYCMayor is going to paint a big, expensive, yellow Black Lives Matter sign on Fifth Avenue, denigrating this luxury Avenue. This will further antagonize New York's Finest, who LOVE New York & vividly remember the.... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 1, 2020 In response, de Blasio said, \"President Trump said we would be denigrating the luxury of Fifth Avenue. Let me tell you: we're not denigrating anything, we are liberating Fifth Avenue, we are uplifting Fifth Avenue.\" After the project was completed, the mayor shared a video of the new mural, writing: \"5th Avenue has never looked better.\" Oscar Vela said he was taping a video on Monday when he saw a man wearing a mask go up to the Black Lives Matter mural and douse it with a can of red paint.

      "Article:  (CNN)Three Black Lives Matter roadway murals in Vermont were defaced, state police say. The murals, located in and near Underhill, featured the slogans \"Black Lives Matter\" and \"Black Trans Lives Matter.\" On Monday morning, a state trooper discovered that two of the murals had tire burnouts over the them, while a third had been defaced with white and brown paint, according to a state police press release. The vandalism comes after similar incidents in Maryland and California. In Baltimore, chalk messages by elementary school students in support of \"Black Lives Matter\" were washed away by adults. And in Northern California, two people face hate crime charges for painting over a \"Black Lives Matter\" roadway mural. The defacements are being investigated as potential bias-related incidents, the press release said.\n",

      "Headline:  The three reasons Black Lives Matter marchers refuse to quit\n",
      "############\n",
      "Article:  (CNN)Almost two months to the day since since George Floyd was killed and away from the media spotlight, protesters in cities across the country continue to pound the pavement. Even if there aren't tens of thousands of people flooding the streets as they did at the beginning of the summer, the demonstrators carry on -- unafraid of police presence and unrelenting in the face of potential coronavirus infections. Each has their own reason. Some personally experienced the sting of police brutality. Some demand things need to change. For their unique motivations, all of them agreed -- this work has become a vital part of who they are. Here are three reasons why they still march. To maintain momentum Tyrell Taylor, pictured center in the red hat, leads Black Lives Matter protests on bikes. Before the pandemic, 22-year-old Tyrell Taylor and 12 of his friends used to get together and do anything they could to stay active. Those meetups came to a screeching halt once New York started shutting down in March. To beat the boredom, they formed a group called MBR, or Mind, Body, Results, for organized bike rides. After the death of George Floyd, those leisurely rides became acts of protest. The group meets every Friday at 6 p.m. with a few exceptions. They've occupied the Brooklyn Bridge, Washington Square Park and Times Square, among other iconic New York locales. At their largest protest, Taylor and his friends rode with 1,000 cyclists. Clogging the streets with bikes is both disruptive and peaceful, Taylor, a graduate student at Medaille College, told CNN. Their bikes have become their platforms for anti-racism. \"Our main focus is to be a community, a family,\" Taylor said, \"Without that, we're just a bunch of strangers yelling 'Black Lives Matter' and that's not what we want to create, we want people to know and be familiar with what they're going into the protest to achieve.\" At their largest protest, over 1,000 cyclists joined Taylor and his friends. The group's founding members have all experienced dehumanizing encounters with police -- racial profiling, police brutality, stop-and-frisk. Like many Black Lives Matter protesters, they're calling to defund the city's police department. NYPD funding accounts for around 6% of the city's overall budget. Taylor has had to cancel protests at times, but the group would come back the following week stronger. Quitting would mean throwing away almost two months of progress, Taylor said \"I would say, even if you feel like it's getting repetitive, if you're getting tired of doing it, continue to do it, because they're waiting for you to stop,\" he said. \"And knowing that they're waiting for us to stop, makes us want to go twice as hard.\" Taylor said he thinks now the movement for Black lives is peaking. \"People are falling off, but it's our job to maintain this peak.\" To be an ally Wiliam Kilgore has attended protests weekly in St. Petersburg, Florida, since George Floyd's death. Florida native William Kilgore has hardly gone a day without marching for Black lives since protests began in May. He's documented the demonstrations in St. Petersburg, a burgeoning city along the state's Gulf Coast, on Twitter since their inception, and he said he's seen them grow more unified, even if turnout is lower than it was initially. \"You have to understand that this is a marathon, not a sprint,\" he told CNN. \"I'd say the focus and organization is actually much stronger than it was on day one.\" Black Lives Matter protests across America continue nearly 2 months after George Floyd's death Kilgore, who is White, said his community appears to be progressive, but the Black Lives Matter movement has laid bare inequalities in education, income and opportunity within the city. \"Racism is still deeply ingrained in every institution of this city,\" he said. The St. Petersburg Police Department showed it was receptive to change this month when it announced it will dispatch social workers to some non-violent calls instead of uniformed officers. It's a start, said Kilgore, who support defunding the police department, but \"not enough to satiate people's thirst for true equality.\" The announcement came around the same time police began to fine protesters for blocking the street. Florida has its hands full with the coronavirus pandemic with nearly 400,000 cases, and St. Petersburg is no exception with over 14,000 of those cases. But Kilgore said attention must continue to be paid to the movement for Black lives. \"I plan on staying the course as long as it takes to achieve radical change here in St. Pete,\" he said. \"I am in it for the long haul.\" To disrupt the status quo Frederick Edwards Jr. (left) and Jamaal Abegaz march for Black lives in Fargo, North Dakota. Fargo, North Dakota, didn't have a formal Black Lives Matter chapter until a few days after the death of George Floyd, when four residents coalesced to found the organization's Fargo-Moorhead branch. They've had to become a family fast. Before they joined the Black Lives Matter board, they advocated for Black lives in Fargo in different ways: Kiara Jackson is president of North Dakota State University's Black Student Association, where she met fellow board member and graduate student Frederick Edwards Jr. There's Faith Dixon, who runs a daycare and nonprofit in Fargo, and Jamaal Abegaz works with the local Democratic Socialists group. For their differences in background and age, they're a formidable team. They've led several marches since May 30 in their predominantly White community and met with local officials to plead for change. Their work energizes them. It's also made them targets, they told CNN. They've been told their protests \"make the town look bad.\" Abegaz said he's received death threats. \"Just the simple act of saying that things need to change and that we're not going to go along with the status quo puts our lives in harm,\" Abegaz said. Faith Dixon (left), Edwards and Kiara Jackson pose at a Juneteenth march planned by Black Lives Matter of Fargo/Moorhead. The violence of the first protest has affected subsequent turnout. The initial march after Floyd's death attracted over 3,000 participants. Now up to 300 people join them, the group told CNN. Dixon said they've been painted as the enemy, which intimidates residents from joining them. \"We are citizens of this community which we love,\" Dixon said. \"I own a business here. Our families are here. Why would we want to see a city we care so much about be ruined ... We're four individuals that have a right to speak and have a right to protest, and why is it such a huge fight just to do that?\" Among their demands are defunding the police, or reallocating some of the police department's budget to social services like education and public health. They want a police oversight board that doesn't include police, and they want new police recruits to complete a college-level course about the cultural diversity of the area. And they've asked police to immediately end their use of force, including the use of tear gas and rubber bullets at protests. The demonstrators will hold as many more protests as it takes for those changes to come, Dixon said. Their work has become a part of who they are. \"We're organizing for our lives,\" Abegaz said. \"We have to live, so we're not going to live under somebody's boot.\"\n",

      "Article:  (CNN)The 2020 ESPY Awards opened up with a powerful message Sunday. Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson, US Women's National Team soccer star Megan Rapinoe and WNBA guard Sue Bird were all wearing Black Lives Matter T-shirts. The three athletes not only discussed historic athletes who stood up to racism like Muhammad Ali and Jackie Robinson, but they also discussed the current climate and how returning to sports shouldn't be a return to the way things were before protests over the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Rayshard Brooks at the hands of police. \"The only thing that must die is racism. Black Lives Matter,\" Wilson said. \"As millions of people of all colors protest, I see a world of hurt, pain and despair. But I also see a new generation, a generation that is calling out in desperate need for lasting change.\" Wilson said his white teammates and friends also need to lead. \"Don't just listen, help,\" he said. Bird said Black lives need to matter outside of sports. \"Do Black lives matter to you when they're not throwing touchdowns? Grabbing rebounds? Serving aces? If that was uncomfortable to hear, good, I used to shy away from moments like this because it's convenient to be quiet. To be thought of as safe and polite,\" she said. \"It's great that sports are back, but George Floyd won't be there to see them, Breonna Taylor won't be there to see them.\" Roger Goodell encourages NFL teams to sign Colin Kaepernick Rapinoe said the recent protests are the breaking point for White people. \"This time, we've got to have their backs,\" she said. \"We can't let sports try and take us back to the way things were. Every athlete at every level has the power to show what it looks like to fight for what is right.\" Wilson, Rapinoe and Bird join a growing list of athletes calling for justice for Black people killed by police. Others have included LeBron James, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods. This year's ESPYs, like the NFL draft, were virtual. Aside from the opening, Sunday's award show featured messages and images from protests around the country as well as songs and spoken words calling for the uplifting of Black women.\n",

      "Article:  (CNN)Washington's new BLACK LIVES MATTER street mural is so huge, you can see it from space. New satellite images from Planet Labs clearly show the bright yellow message amid the gray Lego-looking buildings on the street leading to the White House, its grandeur minimized by the distance. The satellite photo. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser commissioned the mural, which spans two blocks of 16th Street, as protests across the nation and the globe continue against police brutality after the deaths of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd. With these protests, \"Black Lives Matter,\" already a well-known phrase, has become even more popular -- even internationally. This mural cements that. Bowser has also officially deemed the section of 16th Street bearing the mural as \"Black Lives Matter Plaza,\" complete with a new street sign. A street sign of Black Lives Matter Plaza is seen near St. John's Episcopal Church, as the protests against the death of George Floyd while in Minneapolis police custody continue. Still, the gesture has not been welcomed by all. The DC chapter of the Black Lives Matter Global Network has criticized it, calling it \"performative.\" \"This is a performative distraction from real policy changes. Bowser has consistently been on the wrong side of BLMDC history,\" the group tweeted. \"This is to appease white liberals while ignoring our demands. Black Lives Matter means defund the police.\" Washington has been the site of more than a week's worth of protests in response to the death of Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police officers. St. John's Church, the site of President Trump's roundly criticized photo opp during a peaceful protest, sits along the expanse of road that now bears the BLM message. The demonstrations will continue throughout the weekend, including one Saturday expected to draw a large turnout. CNN's AJ Willingham contributed to this report.\n",

      "Headline:  How Black Lives Matter went from a hashtag to a global rallying cry\n",
      "############\n",
      "Article:  (CNN)It began as a love letter to Black people in the wake of an unexpected verdict. It was July 2013 and George Zimmerman was on trial for murder in the killing of Trayvon Martin, a 17-year-old Black boy who had been walking in his father's Florida neighborhood. The night the verdict was set to be announced, Alicia Garza and some friends gathered for drinks. None of them thought Zimmerman would be acquitted on all charges. But that's what happened. And Garza felt like she'd been punched in the gut, she told MSNBC. Taking 'Black Lives Matter' from slogan to reality That night Garza woke up in the middle of the night crying. So she began writing out how she felt, in an emotional Facebook post. She wrote that she continued to be surprised \"at how little Black lives matter.\" \"That's really what Black Lives Matter was for me,\" Garza told MSNBC. \"And that's why I said Black people, I love you. I love us. And that our lives matter. And that we matter. And that Black lives matter.\" The phrase \"Black lives matter\" inspired Garza's friend, Patrisse Cullors, to create a hashtag. Almost instantly, it went viral. \"I wanted it to go viral,\" Cullors, who co-founded Black Lives Matter with Garza and Opal Tometi, told CNN. \"On July 15th, 2013 I said that Alicia and I had created a thing called #BlackLivesMatter and we hope that it will be bigger than we can ever imagine,\" Cullors said. \"Over the last seven years we've developed more infrastructure and we've become more organized.\" Momentum around the movement has grown amid calls for justice following the deaths of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and George Floyd. The phrase \"Black Lives Matter\" is being used now as more than just a hashtag -- it's a rallying cry. At protests, it's what many demonstrators write on their signs or chant as they march. Online, it's what many have used to spread the message against police brutality. And globally, it's being used by many to show solidarity with Black people. While many believe the movement is more accepted than it once was, others remain skeptical of what it accomplishes and question its impact. Here's what you need to know about the evolution of the movement, and why it matters. Growth of a movement Black Lives Matter is one of the most well-known organizations fighting for the well-being of Black people. Studies show that segregation persists in many American cities, leaving majority Black communities behind. BLM's goal, according to its website, is to eradicate anti-Blackness and create a society where Black people are able to thrive in the US. \"We live in a country built to keep us away from these resources that we need,\" said Kailee Scales, managing director of the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation. Scales referenced the data. Police officers are almost four times as likely to use force on Black people than White people. Black people are also jailed at a disproportionate rate. Black Americans have lower access to health care and lack the same access to quality education. \"Folks in the movement have been consistently fighting to reverse that trend, to raise awareness that this is not the way we're supposed to live,\" Scales told CNN. Since the hashtag launched, the organization has become more formalized, taken on specific branding and branched out into nationwide chapters -- all in an attempt to solidify the group and allow them to create national campaigns while engaging the broader community. Organizers put together a website, which led to the development of local chapters of BLM, first in Los Angeles in 2013 and then throughout the country, according to Scales. Left to right, co-founders of BLM, Opal Tometi, Alicia Garza and Patrisse Cullors appear onstage during The New York Women's Foundation Celebrating Women Breakfast in 2015. After the protests in Ferguson, Missouri, against police brutality in 2014, the organization became more well known. In 2017 it became incorporated as the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, Inc. Today the network consists of 13 official chapters in the US, plus three more in Canada, according to the BLM website. Local chapters are semi-autonomous, meaning they \"do the work that makes sense\" for their communities, Scales said. The structure allows the group to have an impact at all levels -- doing work both nationally and locally, she said. Each chapter works a little differently and has different focuses, depending on community needs. The Chicago chapter, for example, focuses more on police accountability, while the Boston chapter does a lot of activity around mutual aid, Scales said. Protests in Los Angeles, after the murder of George Floyd. In Los Angeles BLM activists have been at the forefront of the defund police movement, meeting with local politicians about a proposal they call the People's Budget, which would reallocate funding from the Los Angeles Police Department. The group has called for defunding the police for at least five years, Black Lives Matter Los Angeles co-founder Melina Abdullah told CNN. The most recent push began in May, and at the time the chapter had little support from local politicians. After George Floyd's killing, however, the group gained momentum and received some support from a few members of the Los Angeles City Council. In June, after pressure from BLMLA and massive protests, the council unanimously approved a measure to develop an unarmed model of crisis response that would replace police officers with community-based responders for nonviolent calls. Following the vote, City Councilmember Herb Wesson Jr., who authored the motion with Council President Nury Martinez, said in a tweet that he looks \"forward to continuing this work alongside\" BLMLA. And there is more work to be done, Abdullah said. \"(We) never thought that that (amount) was anywhere near enough,\" she told CNN. \"But it's a step forward that we forced.\" The different chapters are bound by a set of guiding principles, which work to ground the individual entities. But they also work together. Chapters tend to work across state lines, Abdullah told CNN. When the BLM chapter in South Bend, Indiana, was getting started, Abdullah said the group worked closely with BLMLA -- specifically comparing notes on the terms of mayors Pete Buttigieg and Eric Garcetti. There's a growing call to defund the police. Here's what it means It's worth noting that not every protest or demonstration is part of the Black Lives Matter network, as some may be organized by people simply using the movement's name. And not every person attending a BLM protest is a part of their local BLM chapter. The movement is largely decentralized, with no one besides managing director Scales receiving pay, said Abdullah, who also works as a professor at California State University in Los Angeles. Chapters tend to have a loose leadership structure, with a focus on on-the-ground organizing -- allowing chapters the autonomy to organize in the way they see fit. Until George Floyd's death, Abdullah said BLMLA had only raised $100,000 in the last seven years, money that it used for \"the basic cost of organizing,\" things like renting rooms, making copies, printing banners and hiring unarmed security. They also try to provide limited support to families who lose members to police brutality, like aiding with funeral costs, which Abdullah said can sometimes run up to $20,000. And unless money is earmarked specifically for the local chapters, money donated through the main network goes to the larger global network, Abdullah said. Chapters can ask for a little money from the national organization, but it's not always a significant amount, she said. But with donations streaming in after Floyd's death, BLMLA has more money than it has ever had. \"We're stepping back to take a minute and process what we should be doing with the newfound money that we've never had before,\" she said. 'All Lives Matter' and other backlash With more notoriety comes more scrutiny, and the Black Lives Matter movement has experienced its fair share of criticism. Some have said while they support the movement's cause, they are not a fan of its approach, contrasting some of the protests today to the peaceful ones of the civil rights movement of the 1960s. Many have condemned the more progressive demands of the cause, most notably the call to defund the police, which would instead invest those funds in communities, especially marginalized ones where much of the policing occurs. Why saying 'All lives matter' misses the big picture Like Abdullah said, the call to defund the police has been a key priority of the movement for years. But as these calls increase, police unions across the country have dug in to protect their own -- even though the movement has support from organizations like Amnesty International and video evidence of officers using excessive force against protesters. And the notion still faces pushback from people on both sides of the political aisle. President Donald Trump has defended the police. Meanwhile, politicians like Gov. Tony Evers of Wisconsin, a Democrat, has said defunding goes too far. Others have called the movement too radical. In Arizona, Rep. Walt Blackman, a Black GOP member of the Arizona Legislature, labeled BLM a \"terrorist organization\" in an interview with Fox News Radio affiliate KFYI. He then told the Arizona Republic in a follow up interview that BLM is an \"ideology that goes against the very concepts and precepts of our principles in the United States.\" Critics have also responded to the phrase \"Black Lives Matter\" by coining their own slogans, such as \"All Lives Matter,\" which some argue minimizes the current struggle Black people face against systemic racism, and \"Blue Lives Matter,\" referring to the lives of police. Trump previously called the words \"Black Lives Matter\" a \"symbol of hate\" in a tweet criticizing New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio for \"denigrating\" Fifth Avenue in Manhattan with a BLM mural. Still, Michael Kazin, who studies social movements at Georgetown University, said it's surprising that the movement hasn't received more backlash. He said it's the first time in history that a movement focused on Black equality has seen this kind of support from White people. \"Even in the '60s, with the (March on Washington), polls at the time never had more than 15, 20% support among Whites,\" Kazin, who is also the co-editor of the democratic-socialist publication Dissent Magazine, told CNN. There's been an outpouring of support from diverse populations, he said. He used Portland, Oregon, as an example, where federal officers have used tear gas and force against on majority-White protesters. \"We're seeing huge crowds in little cities, or even where there's hardly any Black people,\" Kazin said. \"That's new. That didn't happen in the '60s, or even in 2013.\" Why people are rallying behind BLM It's been said that this moment feels different. It's bigger, more mainstream. White people are protesting just as much as people of color. Even large corporations and brands, which may have been silent in the past, are getting involved. Last month NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said \"Black Lives Matter\" in an apology video, a far cry from the league's stance during the 2016-17 season, when Colin Kaepernick became increasingly vocal about police brutality to the chagrin of the league. Kaepernick has not been with a team since. Companies like Peloton, Disney, Facebook and others have spoken up against racial injustice, while the CEO of Netflix donated $120 million to historically Black colleges and universities. Taylor Swift, who previously stayed away from anything remotely controversial, has voiced her support for the BLM movement, and even called for the removal of Confederate monuments in Tennessee. Meanwhile, Seth Rogen, Steve Carrell and others have donated to bail funds for protesters. Hide Caption 37 of 37 Photos: Protests across the globe after George Floyd's death French police clash with protesters during a Black Lives Matter protest in Paris on Saturday, June 13. Hide Caption 1 of 37 With the rise of social media in the 2010s, images showing police brutality against Black people have reached a much wider audience. Now a whole generation has grown up exposed to the issue of systemic racism. Or, as Minneapolis community organizer Shanene Herbert put it, the trauma. \"They (young people) have experienced trauma,\" she told CNN. \"Seeing your friends, your families and even yourself harassed by the police and killed by the police, it's traumatic. And they don't know what to do with that.\" More people are demanding change. And BLM has been a big motivator in that shift. Mary Westbrook, who lives in Philadelphia and participated in the city's protests in June, told CNN that she felt it was important for her to support the movement. The three reasons Black Lives Matter marchers refuse to quit Westbrook, who is White, was among a group of demonstrators that was sprayed with tear gas. Afterward, she shared an image of herself on Twitter, noting her \"face and eyes are on fire.\" \"I've lived in this city for 16 years,\" the 38-year-old told CNN in a Twitter message in June. \"I am a children's librarian at the library right there on the Parkway (which is why I know the area and streets there really well). I see every day what black and other POC are dealing with in this city.\" In the last seven years, BLM activists have made their message mainstream, according to Marcia Chatelain, author of \"Franchise: The Golden Arches in Black America.\" \"There's been a shift in the public and a willingness to engage with their ideas,\" Chatelain, an American studies professor at Georgetown University, told CNN. For example, she said, \"people are willing to take a second to understand what defunding the police and prison abolition are all about.\" What the future holds When asked what she hopes for BLM's future, co-founder Cullors said she knows the movement will win. The next Greatest Generation \"I know this because our work is full of love, healing and dignity,\" she said. \"And we center Black people's humanity and life over our death and decimation.\" The task isn't an easy one. Kazin, the Georgetown professor, pointed out that the BLM movement is about power -- having power to decide how policing will look, or having power to access quality education. BLM signs in windows, anti-racist reading lists -- all these things are good, Kazin said. But unless they are coupled with a true shift in power and larger political solidarity efforts, little will change. Still, people are listening now. And Scales, like Cullors, is optimistic. \"At this point, we don't stop,\" she said. \"We're not able to relax. It's now the opportunity to push for the true transformation that we've been working for.\" CNN's Christina Zdanowicz contributed to this report.\n",

      "Headline:  Trump strategizes with campaign advisers on re-election amid growing challenges\n",
      "############\n",
      "Article:  By Steve Holland 3 MIN READ WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump met with his top campaign advisers on Thursday, officials said, amid polls showing his tumbling prospects for re-election as the U.S. economy suffers from a global pandemic and protesters gather in cities across the country. FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump delivers a statement on the ongoing protests over racial inequality in the wake of the death of George Floyd while in Minneapolis police custody, in the Rose Garden at the White House in Washington, U.S., June 1, 2020. REUTERS/Tom Brenner Trump sat down at the White House with campaign chairman Brad Parscale, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, senior adviser Jared Kushner, Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel, deputy campaign manager Bill Stepien and pollster Tony Fabrizio, among others. The president had a second, larger meeting with a broader group of campaign and RNC officials where he discussed attack lines for use on his opponent in the Nov. 3 election, Democrat Joe Biden, a campaign official said. “When Joe Biden is defined, the president runs very strong against him, especially in our target states. That’s something we’re going to work toward,” the official said. Trump was described as upbeat and engaged at the meeting, but one source familiar with his thinking said he has been frustrated as he struggles to respond to a crushing set of problems, most recently mass protests resulting from the death last week in police custody of African American man George Floyd in Minneapolis. Trump on Friday canceled a planned weekend visit to his golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey, an FAA advisory said, thus sparing him criticism about the optics of such a trip. Trump has pushed a law-and-order theme in the wake of protests that grew violent last weekend. He has called Floyd’s death a “grave tragedy” and said he respected the rights of peaceful protesters. But he has faced criticism for not showing more empathy and a way forward for improving race relations. In the meeting, Trump expressed a desire to engage more with the African American community, the campaign official said. “The president was really engaged on that topic and wants to move the needle and talk to voters,” the official said. The president has touted prison reform and funding for historically black colleges and universities as helpful for the community. The strong economy was a selling point as well until the coronavirus lockdown forced more than 40 million people from their jobs. A raft of public polls showed Biden with a lead nationally and more importantly, ahead of Trump in some of the battleground states where the election will be decided. Trump’s political advisers, however, see active Republican enthusiasm for his candidacy based on a spotless record of victories by the 64 party candidates he has endorsed in special elections since the 2018 midterms. This 64-0 record, a White House official said, “shows just how united his base is and how strong it is.” In an interview on Wednesday with Fox News Radio’s The Brian Kilmeade Show, Trump brushed aside the polls. “I have other polls where I’m winning, and you’ve seen them too, I guess,” he said.

      "Headline:  Biden facing pressure within party as running mate search enters final phase\n",
      "############\n",
      "Article:  By Joseph Ax, Trevor Hunnicutt 6 MIN READ (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden is facing pressure from contending groups inside his party as he prepares to interview a shortlist of women for the most important hire of his political career: his running mate. Biden, who committed to choosing a woman for the job he held for eight years under President Barack Obama, said this week he expected the background vetting process to conclude around July 24. He would then interview each finalist before making a decision, expected by early August. The selection of the vice presidential candidate has taken on outsize importance this year, reflecting the desperation to defeat Republican President Donald Trump among Democrats, who have agonized over which candidate would give Biden the biggest boost in the Nov. 3 election. Biden leads in national and battleground-state opinion polls as voters fault Trump for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, the subsequent economic recession and race relations. Adding to the weight of Biden’s choice, he would be 78 at his January inauguration, making him the oldest U.S. president and setting up his vice president as an early front-runner for the 2024 race should he serve only one term. “There’s a lot of attention on this for a number of reasons, not least of which that Vice President Biden is 77 years old,” former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said. Reid, who has had several conversations about the topic with Biden, said the list narrowed in recent weeks but remained fairly large. The women under serious consideration include Senators Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren and Tammy Duckworth; U.S. Representatives Val Demings and Karen Bass; former U.S. national security adviser Susan Rice; New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham; and Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, according to interviews with Democratic officials. Harris cemented herself early as a favorite after dropping her presidential bid, particularly among top fundraisers, who have Biden’s ear and tend to be more centrist. Online betting site PredictIt puts her odds of being picked at 41%, far higher than any of the other candidates on the list. The Biden campaign declined to comment on the search. In making his choice, Biden has to balance many factors, including ideology, race and ethnicity, as well as candidates’ ability to raise money, create enthusiasm and fulfill the traditional vice presidential “attack dog” role by going after Trump. Slideshow ( 3 images ) Alex Heckler, a member of Biden’s national finance committee who backs Harris as running mate, said the ideal candidate given Trump’s “bogus” allegations about Biden’s lack of mental stamina would be someone who could attack Trump’s shortcomings and be qualified to serve as president if needed. MOUNTING CALLS FOR BLACK RUNNING MATE Perhaps the biggest question facing Biden is whether to select a Black woman following national protests over racial injustice following the police killing of George Floyd, an African American, in Minneapolis. Warren is the only white candidate on the shortlist, which includes five Black women as well as Grisham, who is Latina, and Duckworth, who is an Asian American. “As I am witnessing what is happening in this country right now, I am more convinced than ever that Joe Biden needs a Black woman as his vice presidential candidate,” said LaTosha Brown, a co-founder of the advocacy group Black Voters Matter. Leah Daughtry, a Democratic official who ran the 2008 convention that nominated Obama, the country’s first Black president, has also lobbied Biden and top campaign officials like Anita Dunn to pick a Black woman. “Nominating a Black woman will get you the enthusiasm that Joe Biden is going to need to run a successful race in this pandemic environment,” she said. Left-wing activists mounted a campaign to support Warren, who they argue would help unite the party’s liberal faction behind the more moderate Biden and whose commitment to “big structural change” could address the country’s deepening health and economic crises. Some progressive Black advocates pointed to Warren’s attention to racial inequity in crafting her policy platform as a presidential contender, while noting that Harris’ background as a prosecutor in California and Demings’ as a police chief in Florida might make them less appealing to criminal justice activists. “Representation is important; it’s just not sufficient,” said Maurice Mitchell, executive director of the liberal Working Families Party. Mitchell said he planned to make the case for Warren directly to Biden or his senior aides during an expected sit-down soon. Among the other potential picks, Grisham could boost Latino turnout in key Sun Belt states like Arizona and Florida, which the campaign regards as an area Biden needs to shore up. Slideshow ( 3 images ) Duckworth, a military veteran who lost her legs in combat, would give the ticket a compelling personal narrative and help bolster the campaign’s national security credentials. Some advisers harbor doubts about whether Harris’ ambition for higher office might upstage Biden’s message. But Keith Williams, chairman of the Democratic Black Caucus in Michigan, a battleground state Trump narrowly won in 2016, said he told the Biden campaign that Harris was hands down the best option. “She’s been on the world stage. She has acquitted herself in the debates,” he said. “She is the most likely choice that they should go with.” Reporting by Joseph Ax in Princeton, New Jersey, and Trevor Hunnicutt in New York; Additional reporting by Michael Martina; Editing by Colleen Jenkins and Peter Cooney Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\n",

      "Headline:  In New York's Harlem, small businesses reel from coronavirus toll on Black communities\n",
      "############\n",
      "Article:  By Imani Moise, Anna Irrera 6 MIN READ NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sylvia’s, a soul food restaurant on Malcolm X Boulevard in Harlem, New York, saw a welcome bump in donations and revenue from new customers in early June following calls to “buy Black” after the death of George Floyd.  ADVERTISEMENT: Your content will begin in 30 seconds But the increase didn’t help the 58-year-old landmark restaurant turn a profit. The coronavirus pandemic has limited its operations, forcing the Harlem staple to lay off most of its staff and slash revenues. Owner Tren’ness Woods-Black welcomed the publicity but said she is more concerned about her core clientele, a devoted group of mostly Black patrons who used to dine at the restaurant every day. While the restaurant industry is expected to take two to three years to return to pre-COVID-19 revenue levels, Woods-Black said it would take even longer for spending among Black Americans to bounce back. “I’m expecting that from the Black perspective Harlem is going to come back very different,” she said. “When the nation bleeds, Harlem hemorrhages.” THE RACE GAP How U.S. systemic racism plays out in Black lives Woods-Black is one of many Black business owners in New York who fear that the disproportionate economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic on their communities might be long lasting. Many are worried the number of black business owners in the city will shrink even further. Though Black Americans make up 22% of New York City residents, they account for only 2.1% of business owners, according to city data. Harlem Skin and Laser Clinic and nail salon Junie Bee Nails are just a few of the local Black-owned businesses in the neighborhood that have decided to shutter their locations permanently. Slideshow ( 5 images ) THE RACIAL DIVIDE Black buying power grew to $1.3 trillion in 2018 up from $320 billion in 1990, according to the latest data by consumer research firm Nielsen. But spending power and consumption are expected to decline, as Black Americans bear the brunt of the crisis due to a longstanding wealth gap and lower access to financing, education, healthcare and home ownership. (For a graphic on the U.S. economic racial divide and pandemic's impact on the Black community click tmsnrt.rs/2Zf1jB5) In Harlem, where 56% percent of the population is Black, lines for food pantries have wrapped around blocks. “The consumption and spending power of black communities was most highly hit because of high unemployment,” said Belinda Archibong, an assistant professor of economics at Barnard College. “It’s a big challenge in terms of thinking of how we will address these issues to ensure that the racial wealth gap doesn’t worsen.” Other cities with large black populations have been disproportionately hit. Detroit, which was nearly 80% Black as of the last census data, had an unemployment rate of 23% in May compared to the national average of 13%. New Orleans, with a Black population of 60%, had an unemployment rate of 16% in May. A few blocks away from Sylvia’s, Mark and Katrina Parris are planning to pivot their lifestyle store NiLu to be more online. “If the local economy is shrinking, if I make myself available through e-commerce, hopefully, you know, I can survive,” Mark Parris said. The economic hit to the neighborhood is already visible. Seeing increased need, Sylvia’s converted its restaurant into a food pantry on Sundays, when other pantries were closed. Concern among Black business owners in Harlem often stems from past experiences. Slideshow ( 5 images ) Karl Franz Williams, owner of cocktail bar 67 Orange Street on Frederick Douglass Blvd, had to close his first venture during the 2008 financial crisis. During the pandemic, Williams secured a loan for his business through the Paycheck Protection Program. But he is concerned about what will happen after the programs run out. “There are issues for Black and brown entrepreneurs that were there before,” said Williams. “They are considered less bankable with equal credit scores and resumes, that is all part of the problem.” Just 6% of Black business owners surveyed this year by the Association for Enterprise Opportunity said their primary source of credit came from banks, versus 23% for all businesses. When approved, the median loan amount for Black business owners was less than half of the loan amounts extended to white peers, according to the survey. Connie Evans, AEO’s president and chief executive, said availability of capital to Black-owned businesses has improved since 2008, but she urged lenders to do more. “These local businesses in the community, just because they don’t have a strong balance sheet like a large corporation doesn’t mean they are high risk,” Evans said. “They are essential in the community.” Many U.S. financial companies have pledged funds in support of the Black community amid protests that erupted since Floyd died on May 25 after a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck for more than eight minutes. Bank of America Corp BAC.N recently pledged $1 billion to address racial and economic inequality. Still, some Black business owners voiced skepticism that support for the community would be sustained. Tiffany Bowen, owner of Harlem Hookah on Malcom X Blvd, who secured a PPP loan in the second round of funding to settle rent and salaries when her business closed, said, “I’ve heard these stories before, but yet we still have such poor numbers for Black businesses.” “When has the financial industry ever come through for people of color?” Bowen said.

      "Article:  By Karolos Grohmann 2 MIN READ ATHENS (Reuters) - Athletes will discuss and decide on how best to support the core Olympic values “in a dignified way”, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Wednesday, as calls to change rules restricting protests at Games grow louder. The Olympic rings are pictured in front of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in Lausanne, Switzerland, March 24, 2020. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse Several major sports have moved to allow protests following George Floyd’s death in U.S. police custody on May 25, including world soccer’s ruling body FIFA and the National Football League (NFL). Rule 50 of the Olympic Charter, however, bans any form political protest during the Games. “No kind of demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any Olympic sites, venues or other areas,” the rule states. IOC President Thomas Bach said consultations between athletes’ groups around the world were under way. “The IOC Executive Board supports the initiative of the IOC athletes’ commission to explore different ways for athletes to express support for the principles enshrined in the Olympic charter in a dignified way,” Bach told a virtual news conference. After reading a resolution of the IOC Executive board condemning racism, Bach was repeatedly asked whether athletes at next year’s Tokyo Games could go down on one knee, as many have done in recent weeks, to show their support for the Floyd protests. “I will not preempt in any way these consultations with many athletes representatives,” Bach said. “It would not be fair if now I make a statement giving directions or instructions.” “The framework has been set and now let the athlete commission and athletes discuss among themselves and come up with relevant proposals.” Athletes who breach Rule 50 are subject to discipline on a case-by-case basis and the IOC issued guidelines in January clarifying that banned protests include taking a knee and other gestures.

      "Article:  By Silke Koltrowitz 3 MIN READ ZURICH (Reuters) - Nestle NESN.S is exploring a potential sale of part of its North American water business, including the Pure Life brand, it said on Thursday, as the food giant shifts focus to better performing brands. Slideshow ( 2 images ) The business under review also includes regional spring water brands like Poland Spring and generated sales of 3.4 billion Swiss francs ($3.61 billion) last year, accounting for almost half of total water revenue. Nestle Waters has struggled for years, posting just 0.2% growth last year, prompting an overhaul of the business late last year. “We are withdrawing from a bulk business to focus on high-value (water) specialities,” Nestle Chief Executive Mark Schneider told Reuters by phone. “We can then grow...organically and through acquisitions.” Nestle, known for KitKat chocolate bars and Nescafe coffee, said it was expecting to conclude a strategic review by early 2021. It has lagged rivals PepsiCo PEP.O, LaCroix FIZZ.O and Coca-Cola KO.N in sparkling and flavoured waters in the U.S.. “We are not withdrawing from water in the U.S.”, Schneider said, adding that he wanted to keep pushing international brands Perrier, S.Pellegrino and Acqua Panna that were “very successful” in the country. “In the right segments, water remains very attractive,” he said, pointing to growth and margin opportunities. Bottled water sales have come under pressure, as environmental concerns about plastic waste and transportation lead more people to drink from the tap. Nestle, often criticised by environmentalists, vowed to make its entire water portfolio carbon neutral by 2025. Asked about the “Black Lives Matter” protests in the U.S., Schneider, who also holds a U.S. passport, said he felt personally touched by the events and that the company was monitoring the situation with concern. “Two challenges arrive at the same time here, this debate and the COVID-19 crisis which is not yet over.” Nestle, which has also been shedding underperforming brands in other product categories, posted its best quarterly sales growth in nearly five years in April as customers stocked up on well known brands during the pandemic.

Mandatory Credit: Peter Casey-USA TODAY Sports The Seattle Sounders and San Jose Earthquakes participated in a brief Black Lives Matter display before the start of Friday night’s MLS is Back Tournament game at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex near Orlando, Fla. Players and coaches from both teams wore Black Lives Matters T-shirts, with the team captains featuring the letters BLM on their armbands. Players from both teams knelt before the opening kickoff, extending an arm in the air in support. The display continues the theme of social justice in the league’s return to action after play was halted in March by the coronavirus pandemic. Prior to Wednesday’s initial tournament game between Orlando City SC and Inter Miami FC, more than 100 Black MLS players stood on the pitch in silence for 8 minutes, 46 seconds, with raised fists, while the starters from both teams knelt in support of the Black Lives Matter movement.

The 10-year-old had written some of Floyd’s final words: “I can’t breathe, I can’t breathe.” Tawana Boatwright with her boyfriend Christopher and her daughters Skylar, 11, and Leia, 7, attend a memorial in Brooklyn's Cadman Plaza Park for George Floyd, who died in Minneapolis police custody, in New York, U.S. June 4, 2020. REUTERS/Michelle Nichols Corte was among many children at the vigil for Floyd, the black man whose death while in the custody of a white police officer in Minneapolis set off a wave of nationwide protests and ignited a debate about race and justice. “I’m here to protest for George Floyd because he didn’t deserve to die,” said Corte, who was accompanied by his stepfather, Timothy Walker, and almost-2-year-old brother, Cody. Seeing the crowd stream into Cadman Plaza Park in Brooklyn, Corte said, “It’s good because it tells me how many people are willing to go so far to get rights.” Walker, 54, said he took the boys to the memorial because it was important for them to understand racial inequality. Kallai Brooks, 36, attended the vigil with his wife, Alisha, 34, and their sons, ages 8 and 3. “They need to know just as much as I have to know what we’re facing. At the same time, as much as there are people in this world who want to do harm, there are a lot of people who care and love each other, so they have to see both sides,” Brooks said. Julian Brizzi, 37, also took his sons, ages 6 and 2, to the memorial in Brooklyn’s Cadman Plaza Park, which was attended by a diverse crowd of thousands of people, because he said it was important for them to see it and be a part of it. “We’re just trying to have as honest a conversation as possible without sort of terribly scarring their vision of the world,” Brizzi said about talking to his sons. “Understanding privilege and understanding oppression at a young age is not something that’s detrimental to a child.” Slideshow ( 2 images ) Six-year-old Jack Brizzi held a sign he had written himself: “Cops shudint kil peepel.” Derrick and Michelle Johnson took their 3-year-old daughter, Charlotte, to the vigil. Michelle Johnson, 35, is eight months pregnant and spoke about the pending birth of the couple’s biracial son. “I feel a lot of anger and sadness that this is still happening and having a boy is scary at this time. We’re hoping for change and positive things to come out of this,” she said. Derrick Johnson said the couple would soon have to speak about race with Charlotte. “It’s really important for us to have a presence here and show her ... we’re not going to stand for this kind of thing,” he said. Tawana Boatwright, 33, attended the Floyd memorial with her daughters Skylar, 11, and Leia, 7. “It’s hard to explain. They don’t really understand,” Boatwright said. “They know a man who was unarmed was killed and that’s all they know. Their dad is an unarmed black man and my boyfriend is an unarmed black man.” Leia had drawn her own sign: “Black lives matter, we have voices.” “I feel happy for being here because the murder of George Floyd, it wasn’t nice of the cops to do that,” Leia said. “No matter what skin color you are, you still are loved.” Reporting by Michelle Nichols; Editing by Leslie Adler Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\n",

Players have already traveled to Bradenton, Florida, where the whole of the 22-game regular season will take place without fans in an effort to minimize the risk of COVID-19 spread. The regular season will finish on Sept. 12, followed by the playoffs and finals. The WNBA season was due to run from May 15-Sept. 20 but had to be postponed in April due to the novel coronavirus outbreak which hit the sporting calendar around the world.

      "Article:  By Reuters Staff 2 MIN READ (Reuters) - Atlanta Dream guard Renee Montgomery will sit out the new Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBA) season to focus on social justice reform. The death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man killed in police custody in Minneapolis last month, has triggered outrage and protests across the world. The 2020 WNBA season will begin in late July with games contested without any fans in attendance at a single site in Florida. However, Montgomery, 33, said she will give the tournament a pass and instead focus on fuelling the Black Lives Matter movement. “If I go into the WNBA season, I know I won’t be able to give 100%, and that’s not fair to my coaches and team mates,” the two-times WNBA champion wrote in the Players’ Tribune. “I know that if I did go into the ‘bubble’ who knows what it’s going to look like in four months, as far as the movement is concerned? I just want to make sure that I’m fuelling the movement. “As I’m writing this, I’m like, ‘did I really just opt out of the season?’ I’m as shocked as everyone else.” Montgomery, who started a foundation last year to help impact the lives of people through sports, said she hopes to return to basketball once she’s made a positive change in the community. “My heart is telling me that I have a different mission right now that I have to see through,” she added. Dream coach Nicki Collen said she supported Montgomery’s decision. “While I am saddened Renee will not be in a Dream uniform this summer, I am proud of her passion for her foundation... and her chance to impact the BLM movement with her platform as a WNBA athlete,” Collen told ESPN.

Slideshow ( 18 images ) The “Solidarity in Surfing” events in more than 100 locations were organized by Black Girls Surf, a group founded in 2014 to teach the sport to girls of color aged 5 to 17. In Santa Monica, California, about 200 surfers of various ages and races gathered under cloudy skies on a stretch of beach once known as Inkwell Beach, a place where black Californians sought an oceanfront refuge in the 20th century. The event was meant to honor Floyd and others who were victims of police brutality, said Sayuri Blondt, 29, a local coordinator for Black Girls Surf. The surfers waded into the water for a paddle out, a traditional Hawaiian ceremony to celebrate the life of someone who has died. About 200 yards offshore, they held a moment of silence while floating on their boards in a large circle, and placed yellow, pink and red flowers in the water. Some had written “Black Lives Matter” on their surfboards. Panpan Wang, 37, displayed the names of black people killed by police on his chest. Rhonda Harper, who founded Black Girls Surf after seeing that black women were underrepresented among professional surfers, said the group aimed to show “there can be solidarity in all of this violence.” “I wanted the young girls to see that people do really care,” Harper said via phone from Senegal. One person on the Santa Monica beach asked how others could support Black Girls Surf. Blondt said the group would welcome donations of surfboards or wetsuits. “When you are out in the ocean surfing and you do see a woman of color, just be friendly with her and help her to feel welcome in the ocean,” she said. “That’s the biggest thing.” Reporting by Lisa Richwine; Additional reporting by Lucy Nicholson; Editing by Leslie Adler Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\n",

      "Article:  By Brian Munoz, Mica Rosenberg 5 MIN READ ANNA, Ill./NEW YORK (Reuters) - Before sundown on Thursday around 150 protesters marched down the main street in Anna, Illinois, past Bob’s Tavern, Oasis of Grace Church, Douglas Skating Rink and Casey’s General Store holding homemade signs and chanting “black lives matter.” Protesters rally against the death in Minneapolis police custody of George Floyd in Anna, Illinois, U.S., June 4, 2020. REUTERS/Brian Munoz Nearly a century ago this southern Illinois town of 4,200 residents expelled most of its African-American residents, according to historians. The rally was held in solidarity with others protesting the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis with a white policeman’s knee on his neck. Some residents said they were marching as a way to try to move beyond their own community’s past. Joe Plemon, 73, an elder at the First Evangelical Presbyterian Church, said he had prepared several Bible passages - laments - to read at the protest. “We have been challenged within my own denomination, and I know this is going on at other churches as well, to say, ‘Let’s not just wink at this, let’s step up, let’s admit the things that we’re ashamed of and let’s confess the places where we’ve sinned.’” Anna was once known as one of the “sundown towns,” or thousands of American localities where black people were not welcome, according to sociologist and historian James Loewen, who wrote a book about the phenomenon. While most national attention has been focused on massive demonstrations and violent clashes with police in the United States’ biggest cities like New York and Los Angeles, hundreds of spontaneous demonstrations have popped up in little towns and rural areas across the nation in recent days. BuzzFeed reporter Anne Helen Petersen based in Missoula, Montana, has gathered a growing thread of local news reports and social media posts showing nearly 250 protests in smaller communities - some with just a few hundred residents - in all 50 states. Many of them are being held in conservative towns like Anna, which is 90% white and sits in a county where Republican President Donald Trump won 68% of the votes in the 2016 election. “We can’t put our head in the sand,” Plemon said. “It’s good for us to step up and say we want to be part of the solution.” One of the mostly young organizers was 18-year-old Jenna Gomez from nearby Cobden, Illinois, who said she is used to seeing Confederate flags displayed by area businesses. Gomez had thought maybe a handful of people would show up to the event when she and some others started a group chat about it. “We wanted to show everyone that we are not the past,” she said at the rally over cheers and a call-and-response of “United we stand! United we fall!” Slideshow ( 12 images ) ‘REMARKABLE’ About a half-hour north in Carbondale, Illinois, two other young organizers - sisters Adah, 16, and Maat Mays, 18 - came up with the idea of staging a vigil on Sunday in their small town of 25,000 while watching live Instagram feeds of demonstrations in Minneapolis. “When the protests started in the larger cities, I thought, ‘I am not in a big city but I can still bring awareness and find a way to honor the names of the people who have been killed by the police,’” said Maat Mays. One state over in Indiana, sociology professor Jared Friesen found it “remarkable” that more than a hundred people gathered on Wednesday in the center of Huntington - population 36,000, 96% white and the hometown of Republican former Vice President Dan Quayle. “This runs contrary to the ideas that people have about small towns,” Friesen said, “That we are all hicks and we don’t care about what is happening.” But some in these communities do not back the wave of public action. Jeff Barnes, a retired housepainter and proud Trump supporter who lives in Anna, said he agreed with the president’s threat to use the military against looters. “That won’t happen around here, I can assure you,” he said, gesturing to a group of about 20 men who were not visibly armed and said they were there to protect businesses. The flashes of hostility did not faze seasoned activists like 72-year-old Mildred Henderson. “Pretty soon the minority will be the majority, and they would not want to be treated the way they have treated some blacks and some other minorities,” she said. “They haven’t thought about the script being flipped. But it’s about to be.” Reporting by Brian Munoz in Anna and Carbondale, Illinois, and Mica Rosenberg in New York; Editing by Ross Colvin and Jonathan Oatis Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\n",

      "Headline:  Report: NBPA discusses playing amid Black Lives Matter movement\n",
      "############\n",
      "Article:  By Reuters Staff 5 MIN READ Players set to return to the court next month as part of the NBA’s restart are discussing the best way to push the “Black Lives Matter” movement to the forefront. Brooklyn Nets guard Kyrie Irving and Los Angeles Lakers teammates Avery Bradley and Dwight Howard are just three of the voices behind a coalition of players who have expressed concern that playing will take away from their push for social justice reforms in the wake of the death of George Floyd on May 25. Twenty-two teams are scheduled to resume play on July 30 near Orlando, Fla., and dozens of players joined a conference call Monday to air concerns about playing at all this summer after a call Friday that included around 100. The coalition also seems to have reservations about the basketball piece, too, including a rise in coronavirus cases in Florida and concerns about the restrictive environment put in place to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19 to the players, staff and league personnel, ESPN reported. The coalition released a lengthy statement to ESPN on Monday. “We are combating the issues that matter most: We will not accept the racial injustices that continue to be ignored in our communities. We will not be kept in the dark when it comes to our health and well-being. And we will not ignore the financial motivations/expectations that have prevented us historically from making sound decisions,” the statement read. “This is not about individual players, athletes or entertainers. This is about our group of strong men and women uniting for change. We have our respective fields, however, we will not just shut up and play to distract us from what this whole system has been about: Use and Abuse.” NBA commissioner Adam Silver responded to the players’ multifaceted concerns while speaking to Monday on ESPN’s “The Return of Sports” special. “Listen, it’s not an ideal situation,” Silver told ESPN. “We are trying to find a way to our own normalcy in the middle of a pandemic, in the middle of essentially a recession or worse with 40 million unemployed, and now with enormous social unrest in the country. “And so as we work through these issues, I can understand how some players may feel, that it’s not for them ... it may be for family reasons, it may be for health reasons they have, or it may be because they feel -- as some players have said very recently -- that their time is best spent elsewhere. ... “Things are changing around us. The social unrest in the country was -- in the same way we never could have predicted the pandemic would unfold, in the way it has -- what’s happened since George Floyd’s death is also unprecedented. “I’m incredibly sympathetic and empathetic to what’s happening in people’s lives. And in the midst of all that, to say, ‘We’re looking for an opportunity to restart this league, to try to move forward with crowning a champion,’ it’s not top of mind for a lot of people.” National Basketball Players Association executive director Michele Roberts said there is no threat to the return of the NBA, on hiatus since March 11 due to the coronavirus pandemic. Hall of Famer turned broadcaster Charles Barkley said Monday it would be a “catastrophic mistake” for players to sit out the rest of the season. “I think it’d be stupid to not play for two reasons,” Barkley said during an ESPN interview. “No. 1, if they don’t play, they’ll be out of sight, out of mind for the rest of the year. There won’t be no cameras following. LeBron (James) is probably the most famous athlete in the United States. He won’t be visible anywhere, so out of sight, out of mind. “Also, these guys got to realize this money is going to come back, and they’re going to lose billions of dollars that the players could use to go into their own communities and do some great stuff. So it’s not good on any front. I have no idea what Kyrie and Dwight are talking about. But it would be a catastrophic mistake not to play.” Irving, who is not physically cleared to play when the season continues due to a right shoulder injury, was among the players calling for more attention to be paid to social issues and asking for stronger pledges to impact lives off the court. Other players believe the Orlando platform would be the greatest stage for influencing change through words and actions. NBPA president Chris Paul of the Oklahoma City Thunder encouraged all players on Friday’s call to make the best decision for themselves regarding playing or refusing to play in the name of social justice issues, but he reminded them of the financial ramifications of staying home, ESPN and Yahoo Sports reported.

      "Article:  By Brendan O’Brien 3 MIN READ Slideshow ( 7 images ) CHICAGO (Reuters) - The COVID-19 pandemic has been a bumpy road for many Chicagoans, but they have mosaic artist Jim Bachor to thank for paving the way to some unexpected smiles with four additions to his “pothole art” series installed on the city’s North Side. Along a side street near the iconic Green Mill jazz club in the Uptown neighborhood, Bachor has created four glass and marble mosaics inside small craters in the pavement. The colorful creations, which glisten in the sunlight, refer to symbols of the city’s experience with the pandemic. There are mosaics depicting an Old Style beer can, one of Chicago’s classic brands; a toilet paper roll and a bottle of hand sanitizer; and a red Chicago flag star, in homage to a city that has recorded 1,830 coronavirus-related deaths. “It’s a little bit of an unexpected joy ... an unexpected grin,” he said. “It’s finding a little bit of humor in times that are not funny and elbow to the ribs of us humans and the ridiculous things that go on.” Chicagoans are all too familiar with potholes, and Bachor has been placing tile mosaics in them since 2013 after a particularly stubborn crater in front of his Northwest Side home inspired him. “Everyone can relate to potholes. It doesn’t matter if you are rich, poor, young or old ... everyone hates them,” he said. He installed the two-foot (0.61 m) pandemic mosaics three weeks ago, following the same process used in the other 85 he has completed across the city. Some of his other pothole works depict daily objects like an ice cream cone as well as natural subjects such as small animals and flowers. First, Bachor spent eight to 10 hours completing the artwork in his studio. He then hauled water, concrete and the mosaics to the four potholes, where he spent about two hours installing them. He returned the next day to complete the installation. “We live in this weird, unprecedented time and I got to thinking about what everyone can relate to,” he said. “It was a perfect subject matter to talk to the most number of people.” Reporting by Brendan O’Brien in Chicago; Editing by Matthew Lewis Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\n",

      "############\n",
      "Article:  By John Foley 4 MIN READ A pro-democracy demonstrator raises his hand up as a symbol of the \"Five demands, not one less\" during a protest against Beijing's plans to impose national security legislation in Hong Kong, China May 28, 2020. REUTERS/Tyrone Siu NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Hong Kong’s unique brand of autonomy has been a gift for China. The city has been a channel for the world’s most populous nation to get moderately richer without Beijing having to relinquish control over its economy and people. It is no longer essential to the mainland’s future prosperity, however. Stripping it of the right to be treated differently from the People’s Republic, as the United States has proposed, only shows how disposable that special status is. The nearly universal agreement to consider Hong Kong distinct from China after Britain handed the territory over in 1997 has served four main functions. All are becoming less relevant. The first is the trade in goods. China’s container ports are now sufficiently big and bustling that Hong Kong only accounted for less than 10% of shipments by volume in 2018, whereas before the global financial crisis its share was more than twice as much. Then there’s the Asian financial hub’s role as a spigot for capital movement. That’s still important, but China relies less on such flows these days. Foreign investment was equivalent to around 15% of fixed-asset investment in 2000; last year it was roughly 1.5%. Some, in any case, consists of Chinese funds that leave and return dressed up as foreign money to get tax perks and other benefits. That transfer of value from the many to the few is hard to defend. Hong Kong’s special status also made it a launch pad for China’s attempts to internationalize its currency. That project has been a failure. The currency remains stuck at less than 2% of global payments, according to network operator Swift, and less than 2% of global central bank reserves, based on International Monetary Fund data. Companies have used Hong Kong as a place to raise capital, but that is now available domestically too. Politically, maybe the most important contribution Hong Kong’s freedom makes is to serve as a tentative advertisement to Taiwan, the independently governed state China would like to reabsorb. Even there, the return on investment is dwindling. A Pew survey this month found that only 36% of Taiwanese respondents support closer political ties with the People’s Republic, compared with 79% who favor closer ties with the United States. Being positioned outside China’s capital controls remains one of Hong Kong’s important attractions. Beijing hasn’t worked out how to turn mainland cities like Shanghai and Shenzhen into gateway regions, because of contradictory policy initiatives – on one hand, a drive to open up and attract foreign capital and knowledge, and on the other, a desire to keep capital and media controls intact. There, though, Hong Kong’s success may even have held China back, by making those difficult decisions too easy to shirk. None of this is to say Hong Kong doesn’t matter, or that the loss of its freedoms wouldn’t be a tragedy. It does, however, make the place a poor target for reprisals against the People’s Republic. The enclave is unique only because it has rights China has chosen not to give to its other cities. That is a choice, and nothing more. Hong Kong is the most appealing way into China’s economy, but no longer the way to its heart. BREAKINGVIEWS Reuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

      "Headline:  Attorney General Barr says foreign groups, extremists stoking divisions in U.S. protests\n",
      "############\n",
      "Article:  By Sarah N. Lynch, Andy Sullivan 4 MIN READ WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General William Barr said on Thursday that foreign interests and “extremist agitators” tied to the Antifa movement have tried to exploit nationwide protests over the latest in a long series of killings of black men by white police officers.  ADVERTISEMENT: Your content will begin in 1 seconds Barr’s statements came three days after an internal intelligence assessment produced by the Department of Homeland Security and seen by Reuters found that most of the violence at the protests appeared to have been carried out by opportunists, not organized extremists. While Barr and Republican President Donald Trump have focused blame on Antifa, a loosely organized anti-fascist movement, federal prosecutors in Las Vegas on Wednesday charged three members of the far-right “Boogaloo” movement with planning to cause violence and destruction during protests. “We have seen evidence that Antifa and other similar extremist groups, as well as actors of a variety of different political persuasions, have been involving in instigating and participating in violent activity,” Barr said at a news conference. Barr also defended his decision to forcefully push peaceful protesters back from the White House on Monday evening, saying rioting had gotten out of control over the weekend. Clearing the protesters allowed Trump to stage a photo opportunity at a nearby historic church, where a fire set during the earlier mayhem did minor damage. “We decided that we needed more of a buffer to protect the White House,” Barr said. The attorney general has been criticized for his decision to use force on the protests over the death of George Floyd by calling in a wide range of federal agents to protect the White House and other landmarks after demonstrations in Washington turned violent. The federal agents called in to protect the White House include riot-control teams from the federal Bureau of Prisons, who have been spotted in uniforms without badges or other identification, unlike other police officers. Bureau Director Michael Carvajal said those agents typically do not wear identifying material on the job, and acknowledged he “probably should have done a better job of marking them nationally.” In a letter to Trump, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, called the presence of unidentified officers and U.S. military on the streets of Washington “alarming.” FILE PHOTO: FILE PHOTO: U.S. Attorney General William Barr awaits the arrival of President Donald Trump to addresses the coronavirus response daily briefing at the White House in Washington, U.S., March 23, 2020. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo The Democrat told reporters that her daughter, Alexandra, had been present when the federal agents acting on Barr’s orders cleared Lafayette Park near the White House of protesters. “She thought she had tear gas in her eyes because she was incapacitated for a while and she called me after,” Pelosi said. The American Civil Liberties Union and other groups filed a lawsuit in Washington on Thursday on behalf of the protesters seeking an order declaring that Trump, Barr and other officials violated their constitutional rights. “When the nation’s top law enforcement officer becomes complicit in the tactics of an autocrat, it chills protected speech for all of us,” said Scott Michelman, ACLU legal director in the District of Columbia. Barr said foreign groups are also using social media disinformation campaigns like those mounted by Russia during the 2016 presidential election to widen divisions in U.S. society. “Some of the foreign hackers and groups that are associated with foreign governments are focusing in on this particular situation we have here, and trying to exacerbate it in every way they can,” he said. Barr said federal agents have made 51 arrests so far for charges involving violence. He said 114 law enforcement officers have been injured in protests in Washington and 22 have been hospitalized. Authorities are investigating seven fires set in violent protests in Washington over the weekend, and one person has been arrested and charged, said Regina Lombardo, acting director of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF).

      "Headline:  Fact check: False claims about George Soros  \n",
      "############\n",
      "Article:  By Reuters Staff 17 MIN READ Update September 23, 2020: Further details have been added to paragraph six of this article so that it covers Soros’ description of his time in hiding as a teenager. Reuters Fact Check. REUTERS/Axel Schmidt Social media users have been sharing an image online that makes several disparaging and false claims about George Soros. Some of these claims include Soros being a former Nazi, Soros “swearing to destroy the U.S.A.”, Soros owning ANTIFA and Black Lives Matter, and Soros paying for protesters. Examples can be seen here and here.  George Soros is a billionaire philanthropist and founder of Open Society Foundations. He has been the target of multiple conspiracy theories and misinformation on social media (here). Previous Reuters fact checks debunking claims about Soros can be found here and here.  Open Society Foundations told Reuters via email that the claims made toward Soros in these posts are “false” and “do a disservice to the very bedrock of our democracy, as enshrined in the First Amendment.” SOROS IS NOT A FORMER NAZI Reuters debunked a false claim that a photograph shows a young Soros in a Nazi uniform (here). During the time Nazis were active, Soros would not have met the age requirements to be in the Schutzstaffel. Soros and his family were Hungarian Jews who lived in Budapest during the war, disguising their identities for safety. In 1947 at the age of 17, Soros moved to London to attend university (more  here).  By the time Soros was 17, the fall of Nazi Germany had already happened. Soros could not possibly have been involved in the Nazi party which was active between 1920-1945. He is also a Hungarian Jew, further disproving this theory. In a 1998 60 Minutes interview (youtu.be/AiqHiQYuoOs) Soros says his father forged his family’s identity to protect them. Soros, as a teenager, was placed under custody of a government official with the premise of being his godson. During this time, Soros witnessed (but did not actively participate in) the confiscation of Jewish property (here). In the interview, Soros says he doesn’t feel guilt looking back at these events, mentioning that he was a child at the time and that he was a “spectator” to something that would have happened regardless of his presence. SOROS NEVER SWORE TO “DESTROY THE USA” Reuters found no evidence of Soros ever saying this. Other fact checkers have also debunked this specific “quote” (here, here). An older version of the quote attributes it to a Newsweek interview but there is no evidence Soros said this in their archive. One article quotes Steve Bannon comparing politics to war, saying, “They fight, look at [George] Soros and these other NGOs...they destroy you.” The article also states that, according to Bannon, Soros threatened to “destroy him personally.” (here). SOROS DOES NOT “OWN” ANTIFA AND BLACK LIVES MATTER George Soros does not “own” ANTIFA or Black Lives Matter. A spokesperson for Open Society Foundations told Reuters via email: “We proudly support organizations that promote civic engagement and champion the right of all Americans to petition their government for redress of grievances. Those protesting the death of Mr. Floyd and police brutality across the nation do so out of a deep and abiding concern for country; they don’t do so for pay from these foundations or any other, as some cynics claim.” Black Lives Matter is a largely horizontal, grassroots, global organization (https:// bit.ly/373z22H). Its co-founders, Opal Tometi, Patrisse Cullors, and Alicia Garza started the movement in 2013, after the death of Trayvon Martin. The co-founders recently told the New Yorker that Black Lives Matter “has always been somewhat decentralized” and operates in a horizontal manner: “We have always said the power goes on in the local chapter because they know what is going on”. The organization recently set up a $12 million grant to help organizations fighting institutional racism, after an upsurge in donations amid the current protests. Beyoncé and Prince are among the celebrities who have donated to Black Lives Matter in previous years (here).  Open Society Foundations donates to groups worldwide (here). Some of their previous donations - including to Black Lives Matter and Planned Parenthood - have been subject to controversy in the U.S. (here, here). It is unclear if the foundation has donated to Black Lives Matter again in the last month.   Antifa, short for “anti-fascist,” is an amorphous movement whose adherents oppose people or groups they consider authoritarian or racist, often using aggressive tactics, according to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), which monitors extremists (here). Horizontal in nature and largely lacking official organization, it is unclear how Antifa is funded, if at all (  here  ). SOROS DID NOT PAY FOR PROTESTERS AFTER TRUMP’S ELECTION Following Trump’s 2016 election win, some far-right claims suggested actors including Soros funded the ‘Not My President’ protests. Open Society Foundations denied paying these protesters in any way (here, here).  Soros has been mistakenly accused of sponsoring protests after Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court appointment and protests against racism in Ferguson, Missouri (here, here).  Open Society Foundations recently explained in a tweet: “We do not pay protesters. Neither does our founder George Soros. Claims that we do serve to delegitimize those who are exercising their Constitutionally-protected right to protest peacefully and petition their government for redress of grievances.” (here)  VERDICT False. Conspiracy theories about George Soros visible in this post are unfounded. This article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.

      "Headline:  Australia asks embassy in U.S. to register concern over cameraman\n",
      "############\n",
      "Article:  By Reuters Staff 3 MIN READ SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia has asked its embassy in the United States to register its concerns with authorities there about an apparent police assault on an Australian cameraman during a protest in Washington, its foreign minister said on Tuesday.  ADVERTISEMENT: Your content will begin in 1 seconds Earlier on Tuesday, thousands of Australians marched in Sydney to protest against the death of black American George Floyd in U.S. police custody, after days of demonstrations and clashes in the United States sparked by the killing. The Sydney protest came as Australian police face questions about use of force during the arrest of a teenager of aboriginal descent. Foreign Minister Marise Payne said the Australian government would support Channel Seven, where the cameraman worked, should it wish to lodge its concerns over the incident in Washington with U.S. authorities through the embassy there. “I want to get further advice on how we would go about registering Australia’s strong concerns with the responsible local authorities in Washington,” Payne told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. “So our embassy in the United States will approach the relevant authorities, and Channel Seven will also provide us with their views on how they wish to deal with it.” Video footage posted on social media showed Channel 7 correspondent Amelia Brace and cameraman Tim Myers broadcasting live on a street when riot police approached to clear the area, hitting Myers with a shield. The pair are then seen trying to leave the scene while another policeman swung at them with a baton. “This is obviously a very troubling period in the United States, and a very tough period,” Payne told the ABC. “We encourage all involved on both sides to exercise constraint and avoid violence.” Slideshow ( 7 images ) ‘EVERYBODY’S PROBLEM’ Earlier, protesters in Australia’s biggest city defied coronavirus restrictions on crowds to march from a park towards government buildings, holding signs saying “I can’t breathe!” and chanting “Black lives matter” and “Take a knee” while mounted police stood by. “This is everybody’s problem,” Kira Dargin, an aboriginal Wiradjuri woman at the protest told Reuters. “As a black woman, I’m tired of seeing my brothers go down. As a black mother I fear for my child. Got to stop.” An investigation has been opened in Sydney into the arrest of a 17-year-old of aboriginal descent after video footage appeared on social media showing him being handcuffed and kicked to the ground after an argument with police. The constable involved has been put on restricted duties while the investigation takes place. “This is not the United States of America,” Assistant Commissioner Michael Wiling told reporters. “We have very, very good relations with our local community. I’m concerned that people will pre-empt the outcomes of the investigation and draw conclusions prior to that.” Reporting by Paulina Duran, Loren Elliot, and Jill Gralow in Sydney; Editing by Timothy Heritage, Robert Birsel Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\n",

      "Article:  By Mike Spector, Jessica DiNapoli 2 MIN READ June 10 (Reuters) - Saks Fifth Avenue owner Hudson’s Bay Company is preparing a bond offering to shore up its finances, the latest retailer to do so after the novel coronavirus pandemic forced widespread store closures, according to people familiar with the matter. Hudson’s Bay is hoping to raise roughly $800 million to $900 million through the bond deal, depending on the appetite from investors, one of the sources said. It was unclear whether the Canadian department store operator planned to offer investors collateral such as real estate. The sources requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. A Hudson’s Bay spokeswoman declined to comment. Hudson’s Bay’s bond offering would come on the heels of other capital raises by peers suffering from the pandemic’s economic fallout. Macy’s Inc said on Monday it had raised $4.5 billion through bonds and a loan backed by its assets, while Nordstrom in April tapped capital markets for $600 million. Other department-store chains were forced to file for bankruptcy because of the pandemic, including Saks rival Neiman Marcus Group and J.C. Penney Co Inc. Hudson’s Bay was taken private earlier this year for close to C$2 billion ($1.5 billion) by an investor group led by Chairman Richard Baker. In March, it closed all of its stores due to the coronavirus outbreak. Hudson’s Bay’s eponymous department stores in Canada have been opening up since early May as virus-linked lockdowns have eased. Roughly half of Saks’s 41 stores across the United States were open on Tuesday, albeit with reduced hours. The Saks flagship store in Manhattan was boarded up this month in the wake of protests over the treatment of George Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis after a white police officer kneeled on his neck for more than eight minutes.

      "Headline:  London police to crackdown on illegal parties as officers attacked again\n",
      "############\n",
      "Article:  By Michael Holden, Guy Faulconbridge 3 MIN READ LONDON (Reuters) - London police will crackdown on illegal street parties after officers came under attack for the second night running as they tried to disperse an unauthorised gathering, the capital’s police chief said on Friday. As Britain has begun to ease strict coronavirus lockdown rules, police have had to deal with a number of illegal parties and raves across the country with many people flouting guidelines that only groups of up to six can meet outdoors. “It’s hot, some people have drunk far too much, some people are just angry and aggressive, and some are plain violent,” London police chief Cressida Dick said. The events were unlawful and should not be happening, she said, warning: “We will come and close them down.” On Wednesday night, 22 officers were hurt and a number of patrol cars were vandalised when trouble broke out at an unauthorised music event in Brixton, south London. Officers came under attack again on Thursday night from revellers throwing missiles in the Notting Hill area of west London, the scene of one of a number of unlicensed music events, RELATED COVERAGE London police chief says: We will disperse illegal parties “We’ve seen large numbers of people completely flouting the health regulations, seeming not to care at all about their own or their families’ health, wanting to have large parties,” Dick said. Police will be prepared for further trouble this weekend. “We know that having months of restrictions people have been frustrated and people will want to come together in gatherings but these illegal raves are obviously unacceptable,” Environment Secretary George Eustice told Sky News on Friday. This month, big protests by anti-racism supporters have taken place in central London and other cities in support of the Black Lives Matter movement and some counter-demonstrations, some of which have turned violent. About 140 officers had been injured in the last three weeks, Dick said. A spokesman for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson called the violence against the police appalling. On Thursday, authorities in Bournemouth, a beach town in southern England, declared a “major incident” over what they called the irresponsible behaviour of crowds who had ignored public health guidance on coronavirus and badly overstretched local services. Visitors arrived in large numbers in a spell of hot weather, resulting in gridlock on the roads, anti-social behaviour and alcohol-fuelled fights.

      "############\n",
      "Article:  By Reuters Staff 2 MIN READ Slideshow ( 7 images ) LONDON (Reuters) - A small group of protesters chanting “Black Lives Matter” gathered on Thursday outside the London home of Dominic Cummings, a close aide to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson at the centre of a scandal that has damaged the government. Anti-racism protests have taken place in Britain in recent days, in solidarity with U.S. demonstrations sparked by the death in Minneapolis of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who died after a white police officer knelt on his neck. The brief protest outside Cummings’s home involved about two dozen protesters who lay on the road and chanted slogans. One of them used a megaphone to denounce the government’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak. Britain has the worst death toll from the virus in Europe, and people from ethnic minorities have been disproportionately affected. Black and Asian people in England are up to 50% more likely to die after becoming infected with COVID-19. Cummings resisted intense pressure to resign, including from within the ruling Conservative Party, after revelations in late May that he had travelled 250 miles from London with his wife and son at the height of the coronavirus lockdown. Johnson, who relies heavily on Cummings, denied his adviser had broken the rules being imposed on the rest of society, but polls have shown a sharp fall in confidence in the government’s handling of the epidemic since the scandal. The protest outside the aide’s home was very small in comparison with a demonstration in central London the previous day, in which tens of thousands of people marched against racism.

Bearing signs and placards with messages such as “I can’t breathe” and “Black Lives Matter”, demonstrators gathered for several hours at a square in the heart of the city during the afternoon, television footage showed. While the country has eschewed a lockdown and relied on Swedes’ sense of social responsibility with mostly voluntary measures to halt the spread of the novel coronavirus, it has banned gatherings of more than 50 people. More than 4,500 people have died in the outbreak of the novel coronavirus in Sweden, many times more relative to the size of the population than in neighbouring Nordic countries. A spokesman for the police, which did not move in to break up the gathering, declined to estimate the size of the crowd. “It was a lot more than 50 anyway,” he said, adding people had eventually begun to disperse after organisers called on them to do so for health reasons. “There several groups moving around the town that we are keeping an eye on now,” he added. Floyd, who was unarmed, died after a white police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes, and event that has set off the biggest anti-racism protests seen in the United States in decades. His death has also sparked protests elsewhere in Europe with tens of thousands taking to the streets in London on Wednesday.

New South Wales police were alerted to graffiti on Cook’s statue in Hyde Park in the central district of Australia’s largest city just after 4 a.m. (2000 GMT on Saturday) before the two women in their late 20s were arrested. The women were found with a bag containing a number of spray-paint cans, the police said in a statement. They were refused bail and will be charged with the destroying and damaging property, it said. Anti-racism protesters, who have taken to the streets following the death of African American George Floyd in police custody, are demanding that the legacies of some of the architects of Europe’s empire building be revisited and their statues be torn down. From Cecil Rhodes in England to Christopher Columbus in the United States and King Leopold II in Belgium, statues of empire builders have been under attack in recent weeks around the world, sometimes from the descendants of those they once colonised. Cook’s statute was promptly cleaned by Sydney council workers on Sunday morning, a police spokeswoman said. Police in the neighbouring state of Victoria are also investigating the weekend defacing of the statues of two former Australian prime ministers at a Ballarat park. In New Zealand, thousands marched the streets of Auckland and Wellington chanting, “I can’t breathe” - a phrase the handcuffed Floyd repeated before dying as a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. Protesters in Auckland carried Black Lives Matter signs and marched through the city’s central district towards the U.S. consulate, chanting “Shame”, while Maori community members danced outside the building, the news website Stuff reported.

      "############\n",
      "Article:  By Andreas Mortensen 3 MIN READ COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - A vote in Greenland showed on Wednesday a majority in favour of keeping up a statue of Danish-Norwegian coloniser Hans Egede that was vandalised as anti-racism protests reached the Arctic. FILE PHOTO: The statue of Hans Egede is seen after being vandalized in Nuuk, Greenland June 21, 2020. Picture taken June 21, 2020. Ritzau Scanpix/via REUTERS The statue had red paint and the word “decolonize” daubed on it last month when Black Lives Matter protests were sweeping the world over the death of African American George Floyd after a white policeman pressed a knee on his neck. Critics say the statue in Greenland’s capital Nuuk is a symbol of oppression by former colonial ruler Denmark and some want it put in a museum. But in the poll, 923 people voted for it to stay while 600 wanted it gone, according to the local municipality. Greenland was a Danish colony until 1953, when it became a formal part of the Kingdom of Denmark. Today, it enjoys broad autonomy, but still relies heavily on grants from Denmark. Egede, also known as the “Apostle of Greenland”, travelled there in 1721 to do missionary work among the Inuit inhabitants. His stay marked the beginning of Greenland’s colonial era but was relatively unbloody compared with other European powers. “It does not surprise me that there is a majority for the statue to stay, but that does not mean we should do nothing, because there is still a large minority who wants it removed,” Greenlandic lawmaker Aaja Chemnitz Larsen told Reuters. About 23,000 of Greenland’s 56,000 people were eligible to vote in the poll that ran from July 3-21. Lack of publicity and summer holidays may have affected turnout. The fate of the statue remains subject to a final decision by the local council. But Nuuk’s mayor Charlotte Ludvigsen has said it would require a large majority of up to 75% in favour of removal for her to process the case. Monuments are under scrutiny in various nations, including Britain where a slave trader’s statue was toppled in Bristol and World War Two hero Winston Churchill’s statue in London was daubed with graffiti calling him “racist.” Denmark’s Egede, who founded Nuuk, formerly known as Godthåb (meaning “Good Hope”), tried to teach Christianity to as many Inuits as possible, but smallpox killed many of the newly-converted. Following the death of his wife, also from smallpox, Egede returned to Denmark in 1736.

      "Article:  By Michael Holden, Dylan Martinez 4 MIN READ LONDON (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of people chanting “no justice, no peace, no racist police” marched through central London on Wednesday to protest against racism after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.  Floyd, an unarmed black man, died after a white police officer knelt on his neck, an event that has set off the biggest anti-racism protests seen in the United States since the 1960s civil rights era. Demonstrators have also come out in cities around the world in solidarity with Floyd and to express anger over racism. Protesters in London chanted “George Floyd” and “Black Lives Matter” as they marched through the city centre. On Parliament Square, on Trafalgar Square and at other locations, thousands knelt on one knee, a form of protest known as “taking a knee” famously used by American footballer Colin Kaepernick to denounce police brutality against black people. Some demonstrators urged police officers lining the route of the march to also take a knee, and a few of the officers did. “This has been years in the coming, years and years and years of white supremacy,” 30-year-old project manager Karen Koromah told Reuters. “We’ve come here with our friends to sound the alarm, to make noise, to dismantle supremacist systems,” Koromah said, cautioning that unless there was action the United Kingdom would face problems like those in the United States. “I don’t want to start crying,” she said of the images from the United States. “It makes my blood boil.” The demonstrators booed as they walked past 10 Downing Street, official residence of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, and some also booed and took a knee in front of New Scotland Yard, London’s police headquarters. Slideshow ( 19 images ) GLOBAL ISSUE Some protesters waved banners with slogans such as: “The UK is not innocent: less racist is still racist”, “Racism is a global issue” and “If you aren’t angry you aren’t paying attention”. The event was almost entirely peaceful. There were brief scuffles between police officers and some protesters outside 10 Downing Street but they were over within minutes. Johnson, who was inside at the time giving the government’s daily briefing on the coronavirus outbreak, was asked what he would say to U.S. President Donald Trump about Floyd’s death and the protests it has sparked. “We mourn George Floyd, and I was appalled and sickened to see what happened to him,” he said. “My message to President Trump, to everybody in the United States, from the UK is that - and it’s an opinion I’m sure is shared by the overwhelming majority of people around the world - racism and racist violence has no place in our society.” Johnson has been criticised in the past for comments that many considered racist. In 2018, when he was foreign minister, he wrote in a newspaper column that Muslim women wearing burkas looked like bank robbers or letter boxes. Outside Downing Street, some protesters chanted “Boris is a racist”. Slideshow ( 19 images ) British police chiefs said they were appalled by the way Floyd lost his life and by the violence that followed in U.S. cities, but called on protesters in the United Kingdom to work with police as coronavirus restrictions remain in place. “We can see feelings are running really high today. It’s been a peaceful protest,” said police commander Alex Murray. “We’re committed to make London a lot safer and to build trust with all communities,” he said. Many marchers said racism was a British problem too. “It’s not like this is just about someone dying, we live our lives made awfully aware of our race. That’s not right, that’s not the natural order,” said Roz Jones, who came to Britain as a child from South Africa.

      "Headline:  'Colour-blind' France avoids gauging COVID impact on ethnic minorities\n",
      "############\n",
      "Article:  By Caroline Pailliez 5 MIN READ PARIS (Reuters) - Back at the start of France’s COVID-19 crisis in February, epidemiologist Cyrille Delpierre encountered a problem when trying to find out what groups of people were falling sick. FILE PHOTO: Signs that read \"All together against Coronavirus\" are seen at the main entrance of the Robert Ballanger hospital in Aulnay-sous-Bois near Paris during the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in France. Seine-Saint-Denis, a mainly working class and multiracial suburb, was already lacking doctors and resources before the coronavirus crisis and has seen a bigger spike in mortality than neighbouring Paris. Picture taken May 5, 2020. REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes/File Photo While other nations had data showing a worryingly disproportionate infection rate among ethnic minorities, France had no such information due to a long-standing taboo on compiling citizens’ race intended to prevent discrimination. In the end, 42-year-old Delpierre turned to data compiled by Imperial College in London on Britain’s epidemic for clues about how the disease could also be affecting France. “They knew who was dying and who was surviving - we were still putting studies together,” said Delpierre, who began his career studying social factors in AIDS and now heads a team of researchers in Toulouse at the state National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM). French governments have long cherished their “colour-blind” policy. Census questionnaires, job applications and medical files avoid references to ethnicity or religion. But now – on the back of the global Black Lives Matter movement and heightened coronavirus suffering in immigrant communities – some campaigners in France say the policy can harm rather than shield minorities. “We’re too politically correct in France,” said Ghyslain Vedeux, who heads advocacy group the Representative Council of Black Associations. “Blacks, Arabs, immigrants, and more broadly poor people, were the hardest hit. Why not make it official?” Medical researchers believe strategy to handle the coronavirus, which has killed more than 30,000 people and infected more than 200,000 in France, would have better targeted vulnerable people had there been more ethnicity data. Only last week did national statistics agency INSEE publish data showing deaths among people born abroad increased more than twice as much as those born in France at the pandemic’s height. “We were three to four months behind other countries,” said Delpierre of the data’s publication. Even then, the information stopped short of recording ethnicity, meaning second generations of immigrants would not be included. Slideshow ( 3 images ) Delpierre and colleagues are surveying 5,000 people to gauge the impact of socio-economic context on the virus. They have permission from France’s state privacy watchdog to ask about ethnicity - while keeping identities anonymous - but are still awaiting authorization to delve into wider medical records. HISTORIC SENSITIVIES A health ministry representative said that although there may be a correlation between infections and minorities, data on ethnic identity was unnecessary to identify coronavirus clusters, with geographical area the important factor. Despite having quicker ethnicity-based data, both Britain and the United States have lost far more lives than France to the COVID-19 disease, about 45,000 and 136,000 respectively. Founded on the spirit of “égalité” (equality) from its 1848 revolution, France has tried to foster a common vision that identity is centred on being a French citizen above all else. The collaboration of the Vichy regime with Nazi Germany during World War Two in the deportation of Jews deepened convictions that the state must not foster ethnic categories. But in late May, as the coronavirus challenged ideas around the world, then French government spokeswoman Sibeth Ndiaye wrote in Le Monde newspaper that it might be the right time to debate the place of ethnic data. The response from President Emmanuel Macron’s office was blunt: “This is not a debate that the president wishes to open at this stage,” an official briefed reporters. Ndiaye, born in Senegal, has since left government in a reshuffle, though there was no suggestion it was linked to her comments. Nowhere in France has the coronavirus been felt more acutely than Seine-Saint-Denis, an impoverished north Paris outskirt with a large immigrant population. There, deaths among French-born almost doubled, while they nearly tripled among those born in north Africa and more than quadrupled among those from sub-Saharan Africa, the INSEE data released last week showed. Jean-Sebastien Cadwallader, a general practice doctor in Seine-Saint-Denis’ Aubervilliers neighbourhood, said he took 50 calls a day at the height of the outbreak from people with the virus or worried they had it. Some were care workers, security guards and public transport workers fearful of losing jobs if they went into lockdown. Cramped apartments were also a worry among migrants, he said, echoing concern at lack of research into why communities like his were so badly-hit. “In terms of COVID-19, we were much more affected, and we felt that,” said the 38-year-old Cadwallader whose clinic receives many people from sub-Saharan African origins. “It was really hard for a lot of them because social help (like food distribution) had to be partially stopped during the lockdown. Migrants could not renew their documents either. Those people were completely forgotten.” Reporting by Caroline Pailliez; Writing by Richard Lough; Editing by Andrew Cawthorne Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\n",

      "############\n",
      "Article:  By Stephanie Nebehay 3 MIN READ GENEVA (Reuters) - The brother of the late George Floyd, a black man whose death under the knee of a white officer roused world protests against racial injustice, urged the United Nations on Wednesday to investigate U.S. police brutality and racial discrimination.  “The way you saw my brother tortured and murdered on camera is the way black people are treated by police in America,” Philonise Floyd told the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva by video. He urged creation of an independent commission to investigate American police killings of black people and violence used against peaceful protesters. “You watched my brother die. That could have been me. I am my brother’s keeper. You in the United Nations are your brothers and sisters’ keepers in America, and you have the power to help us get justice for my brother George Floyd,” he said. The urgent debate, convened at the request of African countries seeking a U.N. inquiry into abuses, was to continue on Thursday. “The Human Rights Council must be the ultimate defender of the weak and do so particularly for the descendants and the victims of the transatlantic slave trade,” South Africa’s ambassador Nozipho Joyce Mxakato-Diseko told the talks. Activists and diplomats said that U.S. and Australian officials had lobbied African countries to tone down their draft resolution. The latest draft, seen by Reuters, does not name the United States or set up a U.N. commission of inquiry. RELATED COVERAGE Brother of George Floyd backs U.N. probe into U.S. racism, violence The latest text proposes that the office of U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet “establish the facts and circumstances relating to systemic racism” and alleged use of excessive force, and report back in a year. Bachelet, in her speech, called for investigating and prosecuting excessive use of force by police and for “swift and decisive reforms”. “Black lives matter. Indigenous lives matter. The lives of people of colour matter. All human beings are born equal in dignity and rights,” she said. The United States quit the Council two years ago and does not attend debates. Andrew Bremberg, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, issued a statement saying that his country was “not above scrutiny” as it grappled with racial discrimination but was implementing police reforms after Floyd’s killing. “As the world’s leading advocate for human rights we call upon all governments to demonstrate the same level of transparency and accountability that the U.S. and our democratic partners practice,” Bremberg said. Slideshow ( 5 images ) China, Cuba, Russia and Venezuela criticised the U.S. record. “Russia knows what racism leads to when it is raised to the status of political doctrine, we remember the Second World War and attempts to rewrite that history,” said Russian ambassador Gennady Gatilov. China’s ambassador Chen Xu urged the United States to “guarantee effectively the legal rights of ethnic minorities” and “stop using human rights as a political tool and practising double standards internationally.” Reporting by Stephanie Nebehay; Editing by William Maclean, Giles Elgood and Howard Goller Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\n",

      "Headline:  As Pakistan glacier melt surges, efforts to cut flood risk drag\n",
      "############\n",
      "Article:  By Rina Saeed Khan 5 MIN READ ISLAMABAD (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Late last month, residents of the tiny village of Hassanabad, in Pakistan’s mountainous Hunza District, noticed floodwaters quickly rising in the stream that runs near their homes, carrying water from the towering Shishper glacier. “The flows became so high that they eroded the land and reached 10 feet from my family’s home. We evacuated,” said Ghulam Qadir, a resident of the village. The ensuing flood, carrying huge boulders from the melting glacier, demolished the cherry, apricot and walnut orchards many families depend on, and left homes cracked, 16 families in tents and local irrigation and hydropower systems damaged. “The flood water broke all the retaining walls that were built last year in order to protect the village,” Qadir told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by telephone. “Now there is a ravine right next to our houses and we live in dread of another flood.” The area is one of 24 valleys in northern Pakistan scheduled to receive warning systems, between 2018 and 2022, for glacial lake outburst floods using $37 million in funding from the Green Climate Fund. But work has been delayed as a result of differences between the partners - the U.N. Development Programme-Pakistan and the federal Ministry of Climate Change - as well as by a change of government and now the coronavirus, said Ayaz Joudat, national programme director for the project. “The delay is partly due to the outbreak of COVID-19 and partly because UNDP-Pakistan would not finalise the letter of agreement signed with the Ministry of Climate Change, which would give us oversight over hiring of staff and other matters,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. That delay, however, was recently resolved, he said, and hiring now will begin at the end of June, with an aim of installing the first early warning systems on glaciers by September. Amanullah Khan, UNDP-Pakistan’s assistant country director, agreed the delayed project was now “up and running”. MELTING GLACIERS With more than 7,000, Pakistan has more glaciers than anywhere except the polar regions. But climate change is “eating away Himalayan glaciers at a dramatic rate”, a study published last year in the journal Science Advances noted. As glacier ice melts, it can collect in large glacial lakes, which are at risk of bursting their through banks and creating deadly flash floods downstream, in places like Hassanabad. More than 3,000 of those lakes had formed as of 2018, with 33 of them considered hazardous and more than 7 million people at risk downstream, according to UNDP. In an effort to reduce the risks, pilot funding from the U.N. Adaptation Fund from 2011-2016 paid for two lake outburst warning systems, flood protection walls and community preparedness efforts in Chitral District and in the Gilgit Baltistan region. The new project aims to install similar systems in 15 districts in northern Pakistan, and to build other infrastructure to reduce risks, including flood walls in villages like Hassanabad. DANGER AHEAD Shehzad Baig, assistant director of the Gilgit Baltistan Disaster Management Authority in Hunza, said the recent flood in Hassanabad was spurred not by a typical glacial lake outburst but by rapid glacier melt. That melting is likely to pick up over the summer months, he said, noting that “June to September will be dangerous”, particularly after a winter of heavy snowfall. Baig, who flew over the Shishper glacier on a helicopter recently for a look, said the ice still lacked an early warning monitor for outburst floods, though as a first step Pakistan’s Meteorological Department had installed an automatic weather station last June. “A UNDP-Pakistan team came last year to study the glacier and there was talk of an (automated) early warning system that was to be installed but no action was taken,” he said. In late May, the chairman of Pakistan’s National Disaster Management Authority warned that the Gilgit Baltistan region had received a third more snowfall than normal over the winter, which could raise flood risks. Residents of Hassanabad said the planned work on a warning system can’t come soon enough, as summer heat raises the threat level. “We don’t care about all this bureaucratic red tape. We just want better protective walls for our village and a proper early warning system,” Qadir said. “This coming summer there will be more flooding and people will suffer”.

      "Headline:  SPECIAL REPORT-Bolsonaro brought in his generals to fight coronavirus. Brazil is losing the battle\n",
      "############\n",
      "Article:  By Stephen Eisenhammer, Gabriel Stargardter 18 MIN READ SÃO PAULO/RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - In mid-March, Brazil took what seemed to be a forceful early strike against the coronavirus pandemic. FILE PHOTO: Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro wearing a protective mask and other Brazil ministers attend a national flag hoisting ceremony in front the Alvorada Palace, amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in Brasilia, Brazil May 12, 2020. REUTERS/Adriano Machado/File Photo The Health Ministry mandated that cruises be canceled. It advised local authorities to scrap large-scale events. And it urged travelers arriving from abroad to go into isolation for a week. Although Brazil had yet to report a single death from COVID-19, public health officials appeared to be getting out in front of the virus. They acted on March 13, just two days after the World Health Organization called the disease a pandemic. Less than 24 hours later, the ministry watered down its own advice, citing “criticism and suggestions” it had received from local communities. In fact, four people familiar with the incident told Reuters, the change came after intervention from the chief of staff’s office for Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro. “That correction was due to pressure,” said Julio Croda, an epidemiologist who was then the head of the Health Ministry’s department of immunization and transmissible diseases. The intervention by the chief of staff’s office has not been previously reported. The about-face, given scant attention at the time, marked a turning point in the federal government’s handling of the crisis, according to the four people. Behind the scenes, they said, power was shifting from the Health Ministry, the traditional leader on public health matters, to the office of the president’s chief of staff, known as Casa Civil, led by Walter Souza Braga Netto, an Army general. Brazil has lost two health ministers in the past six weeks - one was fired, the other resigned - after they disagreed publicly with Bolsonaro over how best to combat the virus. The interim leader now in charge of the Health Ministry is another Army general. More importantly, the revisions underlined the hardening of Bolsonaro’s view that keeping Brazil’s economy running was paramount, the people said. Bolsonaro, a far-right former Army captain, has never wavered on that stance formulated during a crucial few days in mid-March, despite domestic and international criticism of his handling of the crisis, and a snowballing death toll. Brazil now has the world’s second-worst outbreak behind the United States, with more than 374,000 confirmed cases. More than 23,000 Brazilians have died from COVID-19. “So what?” Bolsonaro said recently when asked by reporters about Brazil’s mounting fatalities. “What do you want me to do?” Casa Civil said changes to the March 13 guidance were made by the Health Ministry, following input from states and municipalities. The Health Ministry said there had been a divergence of views due to differing situations in states and cities nationwide. It said the implementation of physical distancing measures was the responsibility of local health authorities. “The strategy of the Brazilian response to COVID-19 was not impaired at any point,” the ministry said. Bolsonaro’s office declined to comment for this story. Reuters interviewed more than two dozen current and former government officials, medical experts, healthcare industry representatives and doctors to paint the most complete picture yet of Brazil’s missteps in containing the coronavirus outbreak in South America’s largest country. They described a response that began promisingly, but which was soon hobbled by the president’s clashes with Health Ministry and cabinet officials who could not persuade him that Brazil’s economic fortunes ultimately hinged on how effectively it tackled its public health emergency. Health experts were sidelined, the people said, and Bolsonaro embraced an unproven remedy to treat COVID-19 infections. Federal coordination foundered. State governors – some of whom Bolsonaro regards as re-election rivals – were left to set their own physical distancing policies and secure much of their own tests and equipment, the sources said. Some experts said Brazil’s stumbles are all the more shocking because of its previous success containing malaria, Zika and HIV. “One thing that has been a shining light in Brazil has been their public health system,” said Albert Ko, a professor at the Yale School of Public Health who has decades of experience in Brazil. “To see that all disintegrate so quickly, it’s just been very sad.” ‘THE FRIDGE IS EMPTY’ When Brazil’s first coronavirus case was confirmed on February 26, the Health Ministry had been preparing for nearly two months. Its personnel were running models to estimate when and how to implement stay-at-home orders in collaboration with state and local officials, sources said. The ministry was the command center for an emergency committee coordinating the federal response across multiple agencies. Brazil’s vast size, underfunded public hospitals and widespread poverty were vulnerabilities. But the country boasts top medical scientists and a competent private healthcare sector. It had weeks of advance warning, as the virus hit countries like China and Italy first. Those on the frontline thought Brazil was in good shape to respond. But the people who spoke with Reuters said things began to unravel along two main fronts: Bolsonaro’s opposition to shutdown measures favored by the Health Ministry and the government’s inability to scale up testing quickly. Cabinet members tried numerous times to persuade Bolsonaro to endorse a nationwide lockdown, according to a person with direct knowledge of the discussions. Bolsonaro refused, the person said, believing the virus would soon pass and that health officials were exaggerating the need for physical distancing that had proved effective in other parts of the world. “The masses aren’t able to stay at home because the fridge is empty,” Bolsonaro said to the media on April 20 outside his official residence in Brasília. Bolsonaro’s office declined to comment on why he prioritized the economy. He faced pressure to do so, however. Members of his conservative base have protested in cities across Brazil against lockdowns that threaten his promise to rekindle economic growth. Yet Bolsonaro’s economic advisors appeared slow to grasp the scale of the crisis. Economy Minister Paulo Guedes, a hardline free-market advocate, in mid-March told CNN Brasil that the nation’s economy in 2020 could “reasonably grow 2% or 2.5% with the world falling” because of coronavirus. That prediction was far off the mark. Manufacturing activity has collapsed, unemployment is rising and Brazil’s currency is down around 30% against the dollar this year. On May 15, Barclays cut its 2020 gross domestic product forecast for Brazil to -5.7% from -3.0%. It cited Brazil’s “ineffective” policy in dealing with the pandemic. The Economy Ministry now projects GDP will contract by 4.7% this year. In an emailed statement, it said its forecasts have evolved in line with the gravity of the situation. Guedes declined a request to comment on his earlier prediction. A Guedes ally, Solange Vieira, who was involved in the government’s landmark pension reform last year, likewise showed little urgency when presented with forecasts in mid-March from the Health Ministry, according to epidemiologist Croda. The ministry predicted widespread fatalities among Brazil’s elderly if the virus wasn’t contained. “‘It’s good that deaths are concentrated among the old,” Croda recalled Vieira saying. “‘That will improve our economic performance as it will reduce our pension deficit.’” Slideshow ( 7 images ) Croda’s account was backed by another official, speaking on condition of anonymity, who was told what happened but was not in attendance. Vieira did not respond to a message on LinkedIn. The Superintendence of Private Insurance, which she leads, said in response to questions about her comments that she attended the mid-March meeting at the invitation of then-Health Minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta to understand the ministry’s projections. Vieira observed the impacts of various scenarios “always with a focus on the preservation of lives,” it said in a statement. PRESSURE FROM ABOVE For a few days in March, it looked like the fallout from a trip to Florida to meet U.S. President Donald Trump might have altered Bolsonaro’s thinking on coronavirus. Just after returning from the visit, on March 12, Bolsonaro’s press secretary tested positive for COVID-19. In the following days, nearly two dozen Brazilians who had made the trip would test positive, embarrassing the government and sparking fears that both Bolsonaro and Trump might have been infected. After undergoing a coronavirus test on March 12, Bolsonaro called on his supporters to suspend nationwide rallies planned for March 15 for fear of worsening the spread. The following day, he said his test came back negative. The Health Ministry, meanwhile, announced its initial social distancing recommendations at a press conference in the capital. Then things changed. Shortly after the new guidelines were issued on March 13, Croda said he got a call from his former boss, Health Surveillance Secretary Wanderson Oliveira, who said he was “under lots of pressure from Casa Civil and had to change the communique” published by the ministry outlining the measures. Croda said Oliveira did not say specifically who at Casa Civil had demanded the guidelines be weakened. Within 24 hours, the ministry had changed the recommendations on its website. It removed guidance on self-quarantines for travelers and the cancellation of cruises, saying those measures were up “for review.” And it revised the cancellation of large events to apply only to areas with local transmission. Oliveira did not respond to requests for comment. He recently left the Health Ministry. On March 15, Bolsonaro ignored his own pronouncement from three days earlier discouraging mass rallies by his supporters. He met with a friendly crowd of demonstrators outside the presidential palace. Wearing the Brazil national soccer jersey, the president bumped fists and posed for selfies. “It was the first time we saw that totally different stance,” then-Health Minister Mandetta told Reuters. The next day, on March 16, Bolsonaro formalized the shift of power away from the Health Ministry, creating an inter-governmental “crisis cabinet” led by Braga Netto, the Army general heading Casa Civil. Brazil registered its first coronavirus death on March 17. In a response to Reuters’ questions, Braga Netto’s office said the group was formed because the pandemic “transcended” public health. Three people familiar with the situation told Reuters the new cabinet effectively superseded the cross-agency group that had already been set up inside the Health Ministry. The big difference, they said, was that Braga Netto now had the final say, instead of public health experts, and that economic concerns were given more weight. The Health Ministry said it would not comment on economic matters. It said the response to coronavirus cut across government departments. Croda left shortly after the creation of the new command center. He told Reuters he did not want to be held responsible for “excessive deaths.” In the weeks that followed, policy differences between Bolsonaro and Health Minister Mandetta broke out in the open. Mandetta continued to advocate for stay-at-home measures in defiance of the president. He also urged caution about the malaria drug chloroquine. Bolsonaro, following the lead of U.S. President Donald Trump, was increasingly promoting the drug as a possible cure for COVID-19 despite little evidence of its efficacy. Mandetta’s popularity added to the tension. An early-April survey by pollster Datafolha showed that the Health Ministry under his leadership had a 76% approval rating, more than twice that of Bolsonaro. On April 16, after days of mounting speculation, Bolsonaro fired Mandetta. He replaced him with Nelson Teich, a respected oncologist and healthcare entrepreneur with no public health experience. Two recently departed Health Ministry sources said the last half of April was lost while Teich “found his feet.” Decisions on testing and new equipment were delayed, they said. More than 15 public health experts, including experienced epidemiologists, left with Mandetta, one of the sources said. Many were replaced by military personnel. “These changes greatly affect the capacity, speed, and the very quality of the response,” said José Temporão, a former health minister who led Brazil’s crisis response to the 2009 swine flu epidemic. “It was a disastrous decision.” The Health Ministry denied that its response was hampered by the changes. On May 15, Teich resigned after less than a month on the job. Bolsonaro had criticized him for being too timid in promoting the re-opening of Brazil’s economy and the usage of chloroquine. Teich did not respond to a request for comment. In a televised interview with GloboNews on Sunday, Teich said Bolsonaro’s desire for a rapid expansion of the use of chloroquine in Brazil was what led him to quit. Teich’s departure accelerated military influence within the Health Ministry. Eduardo Pazuello, an active-duty Army general with no medical background, is now interim health minister. Of the eight people at the top of the ministry, only one had a military background in March. Now three of them do. At least 13 military personnel also have been appointed to lower ministry positions. Days after Teich’s departure, the ministry cleared the way for the widespread use of chloroquine to treat patients with mild cases of COVID-19. The armed forces are widely respected in Brazil and often help with logistics during emergencies. But Wildo Araujo, a former Health Ministry official who co-authored one of the country’s first major COVID-19 studies, said military personnel were being placed in unsuitable roles. “I have the utmost respect for the armed forces, but I pity those entering now because they have no idea what to do,” he said. “They don’t know how to deal with the Brazilian public health system.” Brazil’s Army declined to comment, referring questions to the Health Ministry, which also declined to comment on the military’s role. TESTING TIMES Bolsonaro’s opposition to social distancing and refusal to support local authorities in their attempts to impose lockdowns have helped erode compliance with those measures, experts said. A Reuters analysis of Google mobility data, which collates cell phone movement and compares it to a pre-pandemic benchmark, showed a far smaller reduction in people coming and going from transit hubs and places of work in Brazil than in European countries such as Italy, France and the United Kingdom where shelter-in-place measures have been effective. Reuters also found Brazil’s mobility reduction was less than that of other developing nations, for example Argentina, India and South Africa. Reuters analyzed data from 17 countries across Africa, Europe, Latin America and Asia for the month of April. Like other countries, including the United States, Brazil has also struggled to secure the tests it needs. That’s a major failing, some epidemiologists say, which has made it harder to track and control the virus in Brazil. The shortage of tests is due in part to the Health Ministry’s over-reliance on one institution. According to an internal Health Ministry document viewed by Reuters, the ministry began purchasing diagnostic test kits through the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz), a respected public health institute, between January and February. By April 7, however, Fiocruz had only delivered 104,872 - or 3.5% - of the roughly 3 million kits the ministry had ordered, the document said. Croda and others said Fiocruz struggled to acquire crucial reagents on the international market. Industry sources said years of budget cuts may also have been a factor. The Health Ministry should have established a broad network of private and public labs, one source said, which would have improved the ability to procure reagents and process tests. In a statement, Fiocruz said it had met all its obligations to the Health Ministry. It said it surpassed an initial target of 220,000 tests by April 13 and delivered nearly 1.3 million tests by the last week of that month. It said it expects to deliver 11.7 million tests by September. “The worldwide competition for this type of test was very large,” it said, “which caused a shortage of products.” Bureaucracy also hamstrung Brazil. A batch of 500,000 antibody tests, used to determine who has had the virus, got stuck at São Paulo’s Guarulhos airport for 9 days as the health regulator processed an exception for them to be distributed without Portuguese labels, two people with knowledge of the situation told Reuters. The Health Ministry declined to comment on the incident. It said it has increased testing capacity and will conduct 46.2 million tests, without specifying a time frame. “The initiative is part of efforts to find new purchases in the national and international market,” it said. As of May 12, however, Brazil had processed just 482,743 tests. Of the 10 countries with the highest COVID-19 death toll, only the Netherlands had tested fewer people than Brazil - a country with a twelfth of the population.

      "Article:  Philonise Floyd on the death of his brother, calls for justice Philonise Floyd, the brother of George Floyd, Benjamin Crump, the lawyer for the Floyd family, and Shareeduh Tate, cousin of George Floyd, join Arthel Neville to discuss the death of George Floyd in the hands of Minneapolis police. George Floyd's brother Philonise spoke out against the growing movement to defund the police on Sunday, telling Fox News' Arthel Neville that officers can do their jobs \"and still maintain respect for others.\" \"What I would like is for all police around America to get their jobs and do them the right way, the correct way. Innocent people shouldn't have to die,\" Philonise Floyd said on \"America's News HQ.\" \"You can do your job and still maintain respect for others.\" Floyd's comments came amid growing calls to weaken law enforcement in the wake of his brother's May 25 death. As violent protests erupted across the nation, the Black Lives Matter movement announced a \"call for a national defunding of police,\" which has gained support among notable Democrats and celebrities. GEORGE FLOYD'S BROTHER AT HOUSE HEARING: 'STOP THE PAIN' \"You can do your job and still maintain respect for others.\" — Philonise Floyd, 'America's News HQ' Floyd family attorney Benjamin Crump told Neville that the push to defund police departments \"has not come from Philonise Floyd's family or anybody working with us.\" \"We want to try to work to say we need to do restructuring and we need to work together and in concert to try to solve this problem,\" Crump explained. \"This is not a black problem. This is not a white problem. This is an American problem, and the only way we can heal this country is by working together.\" 'DEFUND THE POLICE' WRESTS SUPPORT FROM POLITICIANS COAST-TO-COAST During his emotional testimony last week before lawmakers, Philonise Floyd called for police-reform legislation that, among other provisions, would ban the chokehold that a Minneapolis police officer was seen using against his older brother. On Fox News, Crump said the family also was calling for the mandatory use of body-cameras, but emphasized a willingness to work together with law enforcement to \"come up with solutions\" instead of supporting the abolition of police departments across the country. Video \"What we want is people from both sides of the aisle, people from communities of color, community partners, to get with law enforcement,\" Crump explained, \"so we don't continue to have... black people being killed by the police unjustifiably and unnecessarily and senselessly, and nobody being held accountable.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Asked at another point in the interview to comment on the Friday night police shooting of Rayshard Brooks, Philonise Floyd sent his \"condolences to the family,\" but emphasized that \"his particular case, it was nothing like my brother's case.\" Fox News' Arthel Neville and Marisa Schultz contributed to this report.\n",

The leader of the largest Protestant Christian denomination in the country shocked many when he urged his members to declare \"black lives matter\" and denounced using \"all lives matter.\" J.D. Greear, the president of the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC), made the comments during his annual address delivered on Facebook due to coronavirus orders limiting public gatherings. JOEL OSTEEN CALLS FLOYD’S DEATH ‘TURNING POINT’ FOR HIM \"Southern Baptists, we need to say it clearly as a gospel issue: Black lives matter,\" Greear said. \"Of course black lives matter. Our black brothers and sisters are made in the image of God. Black lives matter because Jesus died for them.\" Southern Baptist Convention President J.D. Greear gave the annual address via Facebook Live due to coronavirus restrictions on public gatherings. (Facebook/J.D. Greear) The SBC president made the comments in the wake of George Floyd's May 25 death while in police custody, something that he said shed light on the injustices \"that our black brothers and sisters have been telling us for years.\" Last year, the focus of the address was sexual abuse. \"And, oh by the way, let's not respond by saying 'all lives matter,'\" Greear said. JOE CONCHA: WHY RIGHT NOW IS A 'VERY SCARY TIME FOR FREE THOUGHT' \"I realize that the movement and the website has been hijacked by some political operatives whose worldview and policy prescriptions would be deeply at odds with my own, but that doesn’t mean the sentiment behind it is untrue,\" Greear added. \"I do not align myself with the Black Lives Matter organization, and I think saying bold things like 'defund the police' is unhelpful and deeply disrespectful to many public servants who bravely put themselves in harm’s way every day to protect us.\" Greear, who is the pastor of the Summit Church in Durham, N.C., added, “But I know that we need to take a deep look at our police systems and structures and ask what we’re missing. Where are we missing the mark? And I’ll say that we do that because black lives matter.” The Rev. Dwight McKissic, pastor of Cornerstone Baptist Church, a predominantly African-American congregation in Arlington, Texas, told the Houston Chronicle he was shocked but “thankful beyond measure” to hear Greear’s comments, which he praised as “sensible,” “therapeutic” and “without qualification or equivocation.” “It’s almost surreal to me that it would come off the lips of a president of the Southern Baptist Convention,” McKissic said. “It’s true, it’s right and it should have been said 50 years ago.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Greear said the SBC leadership doesn't reflect the diversity in its churches.

      "Article:  NYC paints Black Lives Matter mural in front of Trump Tower The massive yellow mural sanctioned by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio spans a block of Fifth Avenue outside Trump Tower; reaction and analysis on 'Outnumbered.' Much of America these days is rallying around the slogan that “Black lives matter.” That’s an admirable thing. The phrase speaks truth with clarity. It upholds a notion that we all can and should endorse. At the same time, some of us who acknowledge the phrase in its most positive sense feel compelled to distinguish that usage from radical factions that operate under banners emblazoned with the same words.  BEN SHAPIRO: ALL BLACK LIVES LOST SHOULD MATTER TO BLACK LIVES MATTER MOVEMENT  No one owns a trademark to the phrase, but the most prominent “Black Lives Matter” organization espouses extremely radical views that differ greatly from others who are genuinely committed to the cause of racial justice and reconciliation. Go to the main “Black Lives Matter” website, for example, and you see an endorsement of the anarchists’ movement to “defund the police” — a topic I’ve addressed previously. Then, there’s the following statement listed among the group’s stated beliefs: “We disrupt the Western-prescribed nuclear family structure requirement by supporting each other as extended families and ‘villages’ that collectively care for one another, especially our children, to the degree that mothers, parents, and children are comfortable.” Translation: Fathers and marriage are optional and quite unnecessary components in the process of rearing strong families. Video Such drivel is about as destructive a posture that could be taken by anyone professing an iota of concern about Black Americans. Indeed, fatherless families are one of the primary root causes of Black Americans’ current socioeconomic challenges as a demographic bloc. In 2018, according to U.S. Census data, nearly two-thirds (65 percent) of Black children lived in single-parent households, compared to about one quarter (24 percent) of White children. And what are the ramifications of living in fatherless homes? Statistics indicate that children growing up without fathers living in their homes are nearly four times more likely to live in poverty and twice as likely to drop out of school. Young men who grew up in homes without fathers were twice as likely to wind up in jail as those in two-parent families. More from Opinion Tucker Carlson: The left doesn't want Biden to debate Trump Jonathan Butcher: School reopenings — parents, students don't need national consensus, they need this strategy Rep. Rick Allen: Democrats should join Republicans in condemning lawlessness and supporting police Girls growing up without fathers in their homes are four times more likely to get pregnant as teenagers. And with more Black teenage girls getting pregnant come more Black babies’ lives being terminated. Black women make up approximately 13 percent of the female population but account for approximately 36 percent of all abortion procedures. If Black Lives Matter really believes that Black lives matter, they should drop their opposition to the “Western-prescribed nuclear family structure.” No one should ever stigmatize in ANY fashion the many outstanding mothers (and often fathers) raising kids in living arrangements that for whatever reasons lack both parents at home. We all understand that life’s circumstances are often unpredictable. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER And we all should support our larger communities beyond the walls of our own homes. But our “villages,” it turns out, function best when they support involved fatherhood and belief in a two-parent family structure. “The group consisting of mother, father and child,” Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said, “is the main educational agency of mankind.” For generations, Black mothers have heroically striven to fill the gaps left by absent fathers. We owe them a great debt of gratitude. But they deserve — and we should encourage — the support and partnership of helpmates working alongside them and sharing in the tasks of mentoring children, earning incomes and bearing the burdens of daily life. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Anyone truly wanting to help advance the cause of Black lives in America would do us all a favor by affirming the value of fathers in steering young Black lives away from paths of destruction and toward happier futures. As we unite around the principle that all Black lives matter, we must resist being bullied into buying into the radical agenda of and every crazy idea expressed by a group that happens to operate under an organizational name of Black Lives Matter. The distinction matters. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY CURTIS HILL\n",

A beauty blogger from the Philippines has reportedly apologized for posting photos in blackface makeup in “support” of Black Lives Matter, though social media users say it doesn’t suffice.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Tuesday that all five boroughs will salute the Black Lives Matter movement by renaming streets and painting roadways in honor of the group's message. “It’s time to do something officially representing this city to recognize the power of the fundamental idea of Black Lives Matter, the idea that so much of American history has wrongly renounced, but now must be affirmed,” de Blasio said during his daily press briefing. The mayor said his plan is to “name streets in each borough, and to paint the words on the streets of this city in each borough at a crucial location, one of which will be here near City Hall,\" according to The New York Post.

As protests took off across America in June, they soon spread to the U.K., where there was also a mix of peaceful protests against racism, violent outbursts, anti-police sentiment, and even vandalism of statues in places such as Bristol. BLACK LIVES MATTER LEADER SAYS IF US 'DOESN'T GIVE US WHAT WE WANT, THEN WE WILL BURN DOWN THIS SYSTEM' Meanwhile, in the British Premier League, soccer players \"took the knee\" before games and wore shirts emblazoned with “Black Lives Matter.\" But there has been pushback over concerns that it is being conflated with the far-left Black Lives Matter organization -- which has a British offshoot and has promoted ideas such as defunding the police, and breaking up the nuclear family. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab last month objected to the taking of a knee, calling it a “symbol of subjugation,” and that he only takes a knee for Queen Elizabeth II and his wife when he asked her to marry him. This week, left-wing Labour Party leader Keir Starmer raised eyebrows when he made a careful distinction between the Black Lives Matter “moment” and the organization itself -- going so far as to call its push to defund the police “nonsense.” UK FOREIGN SECRETARY CALLS TAKING A KNEE A 'SYMBOL OF SUBJUGATION' SAYS HE ONLY KEELS FOR THE QUEEN, HIS WIFE  “It’s a shame it’s getting tangled up with these organizational issues, with the organization Black Lives Matter, but I wouldn’t have any truck with what the organization is saying about defunding the police – that’s just nonsense,” he said. Those remarks came after the BLM U.K. group tweeted out a series of screeds against Israel, including “calling for targeted sanctions in line with international law against Israel's colonial, apartheid regime.\" It tweeted out a list of demands by the group Al Haq -- including suspending free trade agreements with Israel, banning all trade with settlements and prosecuting those responsible for “war crimes” in the context of Israel’s “illegal occupation and apartheid.” Starmer, who has taken a strong stance against anti-Semitism and last week sacked a shadow cabinet member for spreading “anti-Semitic conspiracy theories,” did not mention those tweets, but they may have influenced his thinking. Video BLM later tweeted that British politics is “gagged of the right to critique Zionism, and Israel’s settler colonial pursuits, we loudly and clearly stand beside our Palestinian comrades.\" The radical bent of the Black Lives Matter movement is not a secret, and the primary U.S. organization boasts of its desire to “disrupt the Western-prescribed nuclear family structure” and to escape “the tight grip of heteronormative thinking.” In particular it has been a promoter of defunding the police, which has proved to be its most controversial policy proposal. Chris Green, Conservative MP for Bolton, joined the criticism of the organization, saying that while he supports “black lives matters – lower case” he does not support the aims of the campaign. “Their manifesto talks about the end of the western nuclear family and about defunding the police. We can see that in New York City – £1bn has been taken from the police. We can see that in other protests, we can see that in Minneapolis where George Floyd was killed, the council there has voted to defund the police,” he said, according to the Bolton News. “When I talk to my constituents, this is not what they want. No one is saying, ‘I want less policing or fewer cops on the police’. Everyone is saying we want more,” he said. BLACK LIVES MATTER LEADER CALLS FOR DEFUNDING POLICE: 'BLACK PEOPLE DO NOT TRUST POLITICIANS'   The Premier League has since issued a statement clarifying its support for Black Lives Matter, saying that it “offered this backing as we wholly agree with the players' single objective of eradicating racial prejudice wherever it exists. \"However, we do not endorse any political organization or movement, nor support any group that calls for violence or condones illegal activity,” the statement says. “We are aware of the risk posed by groups that seek to hijack popular causes and campaigns to promote their own political views.” MPs had raised concerns about the displays of support for Black Lives Matter by the Premier League, and representatives had been quizzed at a parliamentary hearing, where MP Steve Brine said the league appeared to have shifted from a previous opposition to political messaging. “We are an apolitical organization-- we don’t support political organizations,” league chief executive Richard Masters said, according to Reuters. Meanwhile, the Daily Mail reported that a number of commentators and presenters on Sky Sports, who had previously worn “Black Lives Matter” badges, had since taken them off during its coverage of the Brighton and Hove Albion v Manchester United fixture on Wednesday evening. Southampton F.C. legend Matt Le Tissier told the Mail: \"I just don't agree with some of the points of that movement - specifically the defunding of the police and the anti-capitalist points are things I do not agree with.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Meanwhile, Former Wolverhampton Wanderers player Karl Henry tweeted that Black Lives Matter U.K. is \"just a front for a self-serving far-left political organization\" and that “the majority of the UK have now had enough of that organization.\" “A new inclusive and politically-neutral anti-racism movement to follow and get behind is much needed,” he said. “Black people’s lives matter! The divisive #BlackLivesMatter organization, however, DOES NOT!”\n",

      "Article:  Tucker on the incredible popularity of Black Lives Matter Black Lives Matter may be the single most powerful political party in the United States. Tucker Carlson opened Monday's edition of \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" with a discussion of the popularity of the Black Lives Matter movement, describing it as the first political party that cannot be criticized without professional or personal consequences \"The media, in their relentlessly fawning coverage, usually describe Black Lives Matter as an activist group or protest movement,\" the host said. \"But that's deception by understatement. Black Lives Matter is not a collection of marchers with signs. It's not a conventional political lobby like Planned Parenthood or the NRA ... It is working to remake the country and then to control it. It's a political party. \"As of tonight, Black Lives Matter may be the single most powerful party in the United States,\" Carlson contiued. \"Nobody says that out loud but politicians understand it perfectly well. If nothing else, they understand power -- they can smell it at great distances. That is why they are lining up to bow before Black Lives Matter.\" BIDEN ONCE CALLED CONFEDERATE HERITAGE GROUP 'FINE PEOPLE' Video The host pointed out that Republicans, as well as Democrats, have been bowing to the new party, with none other than Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, taking part in a protest march in recent weeks. \"Republican leaders brag about their strong conservative convictions, but mostly they just want to be on the winning team, whatever that is,\" Carlson said. \"That is why they pause before offending China. It's why when Black Lives Matter tells them to take a knee, they do. \"It's all pretty strange when you think about it. If the leaders of Black Lives Matter are political actors, and they are, then by definition you are allowed to have any opinion you want to have about them.\" \"Imagine a world,\" the host said later, \"where you are punished for questioning the behavior of the president or for insulting your local mayor. You probably can't imagine that because it's too bizarre. It is un-American but that is where we are right now. Black Lives Matter has changed the rules and here is the first new rule: No criticizing Black Lives Matter. \"You can be fired from your job if you disobey. Many Americans have been,\" he said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Those Americans include a Vermont principal who posted a status to her personal Facebook page about the importance of protecting both black lives and law enforcement. The local superintendent described the post as \"outright racist.\" Similarly, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago cut ties with one of its scholars, a University of Chicago economics professor who claimed the movement had BLM \"torpedoed itself\" by backing the \"hashtag [of] defund the police.\" \"Black Lives Matter now enjoys almost complete immunity from criticism,\" Carlson said. \"This is unprecedented for an American political movement but Black Lives Matter is more powerful than that. It has singlehandedly revised our moral framework ...\" \"Affirming the fundamental equality of all people is now considered hate speech,\" he added. \"You can be fired for saying it. Again, many people have been. This is a dangerous moment.\"\n",

A Massachusetts mayor has ordered an investigation into the tampering of a traffic sign which read, in part, “All Lives Matter.” Paul Brodeur, mayor of Melrose, shared a photo of the sign on Facebook, which had been altered to say, “THE SAFETY OF ALL LIVES MATTER.” Melrose police opened an investigation, believing that one of its officers is behind the act as the sign appears to belong to the Melrose Police Department. “I have ordered that it be taken down immediately and am taking steps to find out how this happened,” Brodeur wrote in a post on Facebook. “I apologize to the residents of Melrose.” Brodeur's statement received a mixed response on Facebook, with some claiming that there was nothing wrong with the sign while others called it a \"dog whistle.\" The traffic sign was quickly altered and no longer displays the message.

      "Article:  Ben Carson calls Black Lives Matter a 'Marxist organization' Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson on the divide over policing in America. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson came to the defense of \"America's Got Talent\" host Terry Crews on \"The Story\" Wednesday as Crews faced backlash for tweeting that \"we must ensure #blacklivesmatter doesn’t morph into #blacklivesbetter.” Carson told host Martha MacCallum that Crews' statement reminded him of famous remarks by civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. AGT HOST TERRY CREWS UNDER FIRE FOR 'BLACK LIVES BETTER' TWEET \"What did he advocate for? A color-blind society,\" Carson said of King. \"He said 'I dream of a time when people will be judged by the content of their character and not the color of their skin.'\" \"Here,\" Carson added, \"we are putting everything in context of color, of skin, of external characteristics.\" Crews, 51, immediately came under fire Tuesday for tweeting, “If you are a child of God, you are my brother and sister. I have family of every race, creed and ideology. We must ensure #blacklivesmatter doesn’t morph into #blacklivesbetter.” His post didn’t sit well with many Black Lives Matter supporters who voiced their disappointment in the “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” star and claimed that the movement's premise was not to exalt the lives of black people over those of other races, but to call for fair and equal treatment for people of all races. Carson told MacCallum that while \"everybody would agree\" that black lives matter, the movement has morphed into a \"Marxist-driven organization\" that \"espouses things like taking down the model of Western family structure,\" and advocates for the dismantling of police departments across the country.

      "Article:  Harvard University announces all classes will be online for the 2020-2021 school year Reaction from Harvard Global Health Institute director Dr. Ashish Jha. Harvard University officials said Monday that school will invite only 40 percent of undergraduates, including all first-year students, to campus for the fall semester as the number of coronavirus cases continues to increase in most states. In an email to students, university President Lawrence Bacow, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay, and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said officials recognize the \"intrinsic incompatibility\" between the in-person experience and the need to physically distance amid the pandemic. \"The recent upturn in COVID-19 cases in certain states illustrates the difficulty of making predictions, even well-informed ones, about the evolution of this virus. Given this uncertainty, we determined that our fall plan must enable us to bring back as many students as possible while providing sufficient margin to accommodate an escalation of the prevalence of COVID-19 in our area,\" the email reads. \"Without a vaccine or effective clinical treatments for the virus, we know that no choice that reopens the campus is without risk.\" HARVARD GRAD SAYS SHE'LL 'STAB' ANYONE WHO SAYS 'ALL LIVES MATTER,' LATER REVEALS DEATH THREATS OVER 'JOKE' Video Students who choose to live on the Ivy League campus will be subject to tight restrictions, among them no off-campus visitors into Harvard buildings, which includes Harvard students residing off-campus. They will be given their own rooms but will share bathrooms. Students will also be required to sign a pact promising to adhere to health protocols that include viral testing every three days, video training, daily attestations of symptoms, the use of face coverings, limits on gathering sizes and participation in a contact tracing program. Those who test positive for COVID-19 will be isolated and quarantined in an area equipped to house 250 people. Officials opted to invite freshmen to reside on the Cambridge, Mass., campus because of the unique transition to college in these unprecedented times. In this Aug. 13, 2019 file photo, students walk near the Widener Library in Harvard Yard at Harvard University in Cambridge, Mass. The Ivy League school announced Monday that as the coronavirus pandemic continues its freshman class will be invited to live on campus this fall, while most other undergraduates will be required to learn remotely from home. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa, File) “They have not yet begun to build their Harvard network of faculty, advisers and friends or learn about life in the Yard,” Bacow, Gay and Khurana wrote. “Even with the many adaptations that will be in place this fall, we see enormous value in having them on campus in our residential system.” The deadline for freshmen to defer enrollment has been extended through July 24. If the same protocols are in place for the spring term, first-year students would return home so seniors could finish their final term on campus. In addition to freshmen, other students who meet certain criteria can apply to fill the remaining spots, including those who must be on campus to \"progress academically\" and those who face technology challenges. Students living on campus will be required to move out before Thanksgiving and complete their reading and exam periods from home. Those receiving financial aid will have their reward calculated by the college with a “COVID-19 Remote Room and Board” allowance of $5,000 per semester. Remote learners for the full 2020-21 academic year will be eligible to take two tuition-free courses on campus next summer.

Amid a resurgence in coronavirus cases nationwide, other colleges are choosing to invite only a portion of students back to campus.

      "Article:  Overwhelming show of force from law enforcement restores measure of order in Minneapolis National Guard soldiers and local officers from surrounding cities bolster police presence in Minneapolis; Garrett Tenney reports. Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., said Sunday that he told President Trump that some of his Twitter posts about the violent riots that have rocked the nation in the wake of the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis were “not constructive.” Scott, the only African-American Republican in the Senate, said on “Fox News Sunday” that he spoke with President Trump about his controversial tweets following nights of unrest in Minneapolis – and other American cities – and that the president was responsive to his suggestions. “Those are not constructive tweets, without any question,” Scott said. “I'm thankful that we can have the conversation. We don't always agree on any of his tweets beforehand, but we have the ability to sit down and dialogue on how we move this nation forward.” Scott added: “We talked about the fact that there is a constructive way to have a dialogue with a nation in this similar fashion that we had a conversation after Charlottesville, the President will listen, if you engage him with the facts of the issue.” NATIONAL GUARD ACTIVATED IN NEARLY A DOZEN STATES AMID UNREST OVER GEORGE FLOYD DEATH The president drew criticism on Friday following a late night tweet that evoked the civil-rights era by borrowing a phrase used in 1967 by Miami's police chief to warn of an aggressive police response to unrest in black neighborhoods. “These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won’t let that happen,” Trump tweeted about the protesters. “Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!” Video Trump on Friday walked back those comments, saying he was unaware of the origins of the phrase and saying he was misconstrued. “But I’ve heard it for a long time, as most people have. And frankly it means when there’s looting, people get shot and they die,” he said. Trump, in his tweets, borrowed a phrase once used by former Miami Police Chief Walter Headley in a 1967 speech outlining his department’s efforts to “combat young hoodlums who have taken advantage of the civil rights campaign.” In the speech, Headley said his department had been successful “because I've let the word filter down that when the looting starts, the shooting starts.\" OHIO DEM REP, OTHER OFFICIALS PEPPER-SPRAYED DURING PROTEST IN COLUMBUS Trump also revealed that he had been in touch with Floyd's family as he continued to denounce the circumstances of the man's killing. “I just expressed my sorrow,” Trump told reporters. “He was in tremendous pain, obviously, and couldn’t breathe. And it was very obvious to anybody that watched it.\" Trump called on protesters to keep their demonstrations peaceful. Video “The family of George is entitled to justice, and the people of Minnesota are entitled to live in safety,\" he said. “Law and order will prevail.\" The president’s plea, however, seemed to fall on deaf ears as protests from New York to Los Angeles turned violent on Saturday with reports of widespread looting and destruction of police vehicles from coast to coast. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Scott on Sunday said that he understands the anger that many minorities feel toward law enforcement, but said that violence and destructive protests were counterproductive. Video “There's too much abuse within law enforcement towards African American men,” he said. “I have been a victim seven times stopped in one year as an elected official, just driving while black.” Scott added: “Violence in the midst of this, these protests, simply takes away from the actual issue which is that George Floyd lost his life.” The Associated Press contributed to this report.\n",

Hundreds of people gathered around noon to march down Ocean Boulevard, holding signs that read: “Black Lives Matter” and “I Can’t Breathe,” among others.

      "Article:  Biden: It's time to deal with systemic racism President Trump has promised to quell the violent attack on our country, and said: “Where there is no safety, there is no future.” He is correct. Never before in our country’s history have our elected officials – officials who have taken an oath to uphold our laws and pledged to keep us safe – stood aside and let rioters destroy our communities. It is unconscionable, it is reckless and it will be very, very costly to repair. In a “virtual roundtable” with several Democrat mayors of cities under siege, Joe Biden said he believed the terrible death of George Floyd, captured on a video seen by millions, was a turning point for the nation. “The blinders have been taken off”, the presumptive Democrat nominee said, “People are ready for real institutional change.” BISHOP T.D. JAKES: RACE AND POLICING – CHURCH LEADERS MUST DRIVE NATIONAL CONVERSATION, ACTION PLAN The former vice president, somewhat scrambled by his habitual word salad, appeared to suggest that tackling “systemic racism” would require that, among other things, minority communities be given better access to capital with which to start businesses; further on in his comments he stressed the importance of small businesses. Yes, investment in minority communities is essential to their prosperity; it is also impossible without firm law enforcement. History tells us so. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER That’s why the tragedy is not that luxury stores on Rodeo Drive or Madison Avenue are being vandalized and Louis Vuitton handbags carried off by greedy criminals, though those acts are despicable. The tragedy is that poor black neighborhoods, already ravaged by COVID-19, have been ransacked, destroying stores, livelihoods and dreams. The former can and will be rebuilt; the latter may never recover. More from Opinion Indiana AG Hill: End the rioting and America can move forward on racial progress Shay Hawkins: George Floyd's unheard voice – honor him by taking these steps for justice Jack Brewer: George Floyd riots – here's what this generation of progressive leaders is lacking A look back at Ferguson, Mo., where riots broke out in 2014 because of the fatal cop shooting of Michael Brown, suggests just how tough rebuilding can be. The Wall Street Journal reported last summer on the fifth anniversary of those protests that unemployment in the St. Louis suburb was 5.5 percent compared to 3.3 percent in St. Louis County, while the poverty rate was 23 percent, compared to 10 percent in the region. Crime in the city is higher than in most neighboring towns and worse than in 90 percent of other U.S. cities. Small-business revenue in the community, five years out, was down by roughly 50 percent. And that is in spite of considerable new investment in Ferguson. A devastated block of West Florissant Avenue, where the unarmed teen was shot, now hosts a new $12 million Boys and Girls Club, and the Urban League built a job training center on another burned-out block. But the bulk of new investment has gone into wealthier white neighborhoods. The Washington Post reported in 2018, “Of the more than $36 million in bricks-and-mortar development that poured into the city after 2014, only $2.4 million … has directly benefited this isolated [poor] pocket of Ferguson …” Nobody will invest in neighborhoods, or cities for that matter, unless local authorities can guarantee protection from the kind of wanton destruction we have seen in recent days. And people will not move into those areas unless they feel safe.  The Post claimed this was the result of a “corporate mindset willing to take on only so much risk.” Yes, investors will not build in a community still viewed as unsafe. The Watts area of Los Angeles has a similar history. The 1965 riots that took place in that California neighborhood over six days claimed 34 lives, injured over 1,000 people and destroyed $40 million in property. The mostly black community is now mostly Hispanic, but the stats some 50 years later, stayed depressingly constant. According to the Los Angeles Daily News, writing in 2015, “The median household income is about $28,700 versus $56,266 for L.A. County households … Less than half of Watts residents over 25 graduated from high school versus 76 percent in L.A. County. And while nearly 60 percent of the neighborhood’s population is eligible to be in the labor force, only half that is participating in it ...” Like Ferguson, Watts saw a sizable inflow of capital and building after the riots devastated the city. Numerous organizations, including Bank of America and Charles Drew University, invested in Watts, but “urban renewal did not materialize,” as one local authority noted. Ongoing gang and street violence have stifled progress. Nobody will invest in neighborhoods, or cities for that matter, unless local authorities can guarantee protection from the kind of wanton destruction we have seen in recent days. And people will not move into those areas unless they feel safe. The task ahead is momentous. Poor and rich neighborhoods across the country have been destroyed; the damage will cost billions of dollars to repair. This wreckage comes on top of the calamity of COVID-19, which had already pummeled economic activity and crushed job growth. Our cities, just recently thought to hold the future, could be in trouble. Many have started to question the assumption that young people will inevitably choose urban living. That trend had been underway, denoted by data points like fewer college graduates learning to drive and sinking suburban real estate prices. But now, young people are witnessing the downside of city living: because of the coronavirus, cities appear less healthy and the George Floyd riots have made them appear less safe. Mayors will inevitably raise taxes to plug deficits and to begin the clean-up, boosting the already high cost of living. These are dangerous trends, which could bring cities to their knees overnight. The hardship will not be evenly distributed. Most likely, the prosperous sections of Manhattan and Beverly Hills will be cleaned up within months. But minority communities in Minneapolis or Los Angeles may never fully recover, and especially if the Democrat leaders in those cities continue to dumb down law enforcement and refuse to guarantee safety. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Joe Biden never mentioned how he would restore order. He cannot. He desperately needs the support of African-American voters, and is tainted by his association with the 1994 Crime Bill, which many see as having resulted in the mass incarceration of blacks. If elected, Biden would not help create the environment where small firms can flourish and opportunity can grow. Joe Biden would be exactly the wrong person at the helm.

      "Article:  George Floyd death sparks nationwide protests Fox News correspondent Alicia Acuna reports. Public protests and demonstrations in Philadelphia in response to the death of George Floyd and against alleged police brutality began as peaceful assemblies but have since turned more violent as the evening continued. As one major protest intensified, Democratic Mayor James Kenney announced a \"mandatory curfew\" set to begin at 8 p.m. ET through early Sunday morning. A reportedly peaceful Center City demonstration of about 500 calling for \"Justice for George Floyd\" assembled in the afternoon and moved northwest toward the Philadelphia Museum of Art, according to local FOX affiliate WTXF. Whoops! We couldn't access this Tweet. However, a separate protest later materialized in Penn Square, home to City Hall, and turned increasingly violent. The iconic statue of famed former Philadelphia Mayor Frank Rizzo was defaced and CBS3 video from the scene showed protesters concentrating in the public courtyard in the center of City Hall, where some demonstrators climbed atop glass fixtures near the SEPTA subway entrance. Rizzo, who came from a storied Philadelphia family, served as mayor in the 1970s during which he was praised for his devotion to public service. The outspoken Rizzo, however, also served as the city's police commissioner for several years and has been criticized for his fraught relationship with the African-American community during that time. Not far from City Hall, at least a dozen storefronts along the popular Chestnut and Walnut Street corridors were either looted or defaced, and several Philadelphia Police Department vehicles were reportedly set ablaze in the vicinity -- as well as one Pennsylvania State Police cruiser, according to CBS3. Manuel Smith, an editor for the CBS affiliate also tweeted video of a Starbucks engulfed in flames on Dilworth Plaza -- which sits along the west rampart of City Hall. In remarks on Twitter Saturday evening, Mayor Kenney said he appreciated the message of the peaceful demonstrations that occurred earlier in the afternoon, but condemned the conflagration in Center City. \"The peaceful protests earlier were touching showings of our collective grief,\" Kenney wrote. \"The anger being displayed now cannot continue. Please have respect and dignity for each other and return home.\" Shortly after that post, Kenney retweeted the police department's message announcing the mayoral-imposed curfew. The Police Department echoed Kenney's sentiment about the earlier protest at the Art Museum, but declared some of the protesters in Center City as committing \"criminal acts.\" \"Those acts will not be tolerated, and we strongly encourage everyone to refrain from entering Center City. We will continue [to] provide updates throughout the evening,\" the Department said in a statement on social media. As the evening continued, police officers in riot gear reportedly confronted a crowd near the Municipal Services Building at 16th and Arch Streets, according to FOX-29. Officers were said to have pressed the crowd back as they threw projectiles and trying to push through the line of police by using a fence. The affiliate also reported through a source that one armed man was arrested in area and charged with firearms violations. In the surrounding suburbs, smaller protests cropped up, including one several miles to the south in Delaware. A group of peaceful demonstrators outside Wilmington, the state's largest city, were able to temporarily block off a stretch of Interstate 95. FOX-29 photos showed protesters holding signs and blocking vehicular egress. North of Philadelphia, another peaceful protest materialized at the Rose Garden in Bethlehem, Pa., which is also about 70 miles west of New York City. Demonstrators objecting to police brutality marched east along Broad Street toward Payrow Plaza in the center of the Christmas City -- which contains City Hall, the police department and city library -- according to Lehigh Valley Live. Chants of \"no justice, no peace,\" were heard as the group moved toward downtown Bethlehem. The demonstrators remained peaceful, the outlet reported, though an intersection on New Street was temporarily blocked by demonstrators. An organizer of the Bethlehem Protest, Matty Fall, told LehighValleyLive that the group did not agree with the violence being seen in other cities. \"We don't condone it at all,\" Fall said. \"We're really just trying to get the message across that this can't keep happening.\"\n",

      "Article:  Protesters take part in a demonstration in Southampton, England, Wednesday, June 3, 2020, over the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers on May 25. (Andrew Matthews/PA via AP) The Black Lives Matter movement will develop an armed branch of “peace officers” to combat police brutality in black communities during the so-called war on police, according to one of its leaders. Protests broke out across the country following the death of unarmed Minneapolis black man George Floyd while in police custody, bringing the BLM movement back into national focus. In an interview with the Daily Mail, BLM New York chapter Chairman Hawk Newsome described how the group plans to follow in the footsteps of the Black Panthers Party by matching fire with fire – when necessary. MINNEAPOLIS OFFICER'S MURDER CHARGE EXPECTED TO BE UPGRADED IN GEORGE FLOYD'S DEATH “We're talking about self-defense. We're talking about defending our communities,” Newsome said. “You know what it's like to see a taser pointed at a 7-year-old, you know what it's like to see a 67-year-old black woman ... pepper sprayed and pushed to the ground?” “We are preparing and training our people to defend our communities.” Newsome attended a national conference in Los Angeles of party leadership to discuss how the movement can create a “pathway forward” for people. The plan, called “Black Opts” for Black Opportunities, details how the movement can help to liberate black people. “We have black Special Forces officers advising us, and we will teach and train people in our communities, the Black Opts department of Black Opportunities,” Newsome said. Demonstrators protest the death of George Floyd, Wednesday, June 3, 2020, near the White House in Washington. Floyd died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta) The move is reminiscent of the Black Panthers Party, which created \"peace officers\" who open-carried firearms while patrolling black communities in order to deter police brutality. Newsome confirmed that the BLM \"peace officers\" would also be armed and open carry guns in states that allow it. “We pattern ourselves after the Black Panthers, after the Nation of Islam, we believe that we need an arm to defend ourselves,” Newsome explained. “We will build and train peace officers to keep the peace in our communities, to defend our communities, to keep our communities safe.” CAPITOL POLICE OFFICERS TAKE A KNEE TO CHEERS OF PROTESTERS The New York chapter is at the forefront of the movement, the largest of the 40 chapters the organization operates globally, according to its website. Newsome, who worked as a project manager at a law firm before becoming full-time activist, claimed his chapter has grown into one of the most effective ones in the world. Newsome says his chapter is raising funds for a “war chest” and plans to build a headquarters in an unused church in New York. “When we start talking about black opportunities and building our war chest to defend ourselves from the war on the poor. .. to defend ourselves against the war that is anti-blackness in America, then people will have to meet a certain criteria.” CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP The “blueprint” for the way forward will be unveiled in Times Square in New York on Sunday at 12 p.m. and delivered to communities across the country.\n",

CARMEL, Ind. — A bishop suspended a suburban Indianapolis Catholic priest from public ministry on Wednesday for comparing the Black Lives Matter movement and its organizers to “maggots and parasites” in a recent church bulletin. Bishop Timothy Doherty, of the Diocese of Lafayette-in-Indiana, took the action against the Rev. Theodore Rothrock, of St. Elizabeth Seton Catholic Church in Carmel, for comments that the pastor wrote Sunday in the weekly bulletin.  MARYLAND PRIEST OPENS DRIVE-THRU CONFESSIONAL DURING CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK “The only lives that matter are their own and the only power they seek is their own,” Rothrock wrote. “They are wolves in wolves clothing, masked thieves and bandits, seeking only to devour the life of the poor and profit from the fear of others. They are maggots and parasites at best, feeding off the isolation of addiction and broken families, and offering to replace any current frustration and anxiety with more misery and greater resentment.” The diocese expressed “pastoral concern for the affected communities\" in a statement posted on its website. A bishop suspended a Catholic priest at St Elizabeth Seton Catholic Church in Carmel, Ind. from public ministry on Wednesday, July 1, 2020 for comparing the Black Lives Matter movement and its organizers to “maggots and parasites” in a recent church bulletin. (St. Elizabeth Seton Catholic Church Facebook page) “The suspension offers the Bishop an opportunity for pastoral discernment for the good of the diocese and for the good of Father Rothrock. Various possibilities for his public continuation in priestly ministry are being considered, but he will no longer be assigned as Pastor of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel. Deacon Bill Reid will serve as Administrator of St. Elizabeth Seton,\" the statement said. Rothrock had been due to take over as pastor of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel next month.  POLL: ABOUT 7 IN 10 WHITE EVANGELICALS APPROVE OF TRUMP'S JOB Rothrock issued an apology Tuesday night in a message sent to parishioners and later posted on the church’s website, The Indianapolis Star reported. “It was not my intention to offend anyone, and I am sorry that my words have caused any hurt to anyone,\" Rothrock wrote. The church must condemn bigotry, which is “a part of the fabric of our society,” he wrote. “We must also be fully aware that there are those who would distort the Gospel for their own misguided purposes,” Rothrock wrote. “People are afraid, as I pointed out, rather poorly I would admit, that there are those who feed on that fear to promote more fear and division.”  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Doherty said Tuesday that Rothrock should issue a clarification of the bulletin comments. The newly formed Carmel Against Racial Injustice group sought Rothrock's removal from leadership. The group has said it planned to demonstrate Sunday on the sidewalk surrounding the church. It wasn't clear Wednesday whether Rothrock's suspension changed that. The group didn't immediately reply to a message left Wednesday seeking comment about the suspension.\n",

Three people were injured, one seriously, while marching in a Black Lives Matter protest in New Jersey on Friday when a deer bolted into the crowd of demonstrators, according to officials. The South Brunswick Police Department said on Twitter the incident happened during Friday's \"March for Justice,\" which began around 5 p.m. at South Brunswick High School. As demonstrators marched along County Route 533, a deer ran from the high school property into the marchers, according to police.

      "############\n",
      "Article:  As millions Americans celebrate Independence Day, public health experts warn about another spike in coronavirus cases Christina Coleman reports from Los Angeles. Several big-city mayors and top officials are acknowledging that weeks of anti-police protests and riots may have contributed to surging coronavirus rates, weeks after Democrats and even some epidemiologists openly encouraged Black Lives Matter allies to demonstrate in the streets. In public statements and interviews with Fox News this weekend, officials in Los Angeles, Seattle and Miami-Dade County, Fla., have indicated that some link between protests and new cases was at least possible. Still, many officials declined to comment when contacted by Fox News this weekend, and others – including New York Mayor Bill de Blasio's office – disputed that the protests had caused any issue. \"Based on our health indicators, which measure hospital admissions, number of people in ICU and percentage of New Yorkers testing positive, we have seen no indication of an uptick in cases,\" Avery Cohen, de Blasio's deputy press secretary, told Fox News. ATLANTA MAYOR UNLOADS AFTER CHILD KILLED NEAR BLM PROTEST: 'YOU CAN'T BLAME THIS ON POLICE' WNBC reported on July 4 that \"over the course of a week, New York's daily death toll has stayed constant, but its percentage of positive coronavirus cases rose four days straight.\" New York City, though, has seen cases steadily decreasing over the last few months, while Los Angeles, Seattle and Miami have seen recent spikes. In this June 6, 2020, file photo, demonstrators protest at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, over the death of George Floyd, a Black man who was in police custody in Minneapolis. Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, the group behind the emergence of the Black Lives Matter movement, has established a more than $12 million fund to aid organizations fighting institutional racism in the wake of the George Floyd protests. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File) Responding to that report, Cohen asserted that the number of New Yorkers testing positive \"remains at a steady 2 percent, far below the nationwide average,\" and that, \"at this time, we do not believe there has been a resurgence in cases related to the protests, which reached their peak over a month ago.\" Cohen's public Twitter feed explicitly praised the Black Lives Matter movement and encouraged mass protests. One June 28 post retweeted by Cohen read: \"Are you ready to flood the streets to fight for Black lives and against police brutality and reclaim our roots of pride? Join us today at 1 PM at FOLEY SQUARE.\" New York officials were previously less tolerant of mass gatherings — at least, for certain religious groups. In April, de Blasio told the Jewish community that \"the time for warnings has passed\" after he said a funeral gathering had violated social distancing guidelines. HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE SAVED PATIENTS' LIVES, NEW STUDY FINDS -- CONTRADICTING MEDIA NARRATIVES New York's current position differs markedly from assessments by officials in Los Angeles and elsewhere. Last Wednesday, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti acknowledged that public protests likely were causing a coronavirus spike, just two days after claiming there wasn't \"any conclusive evidence\" showing a connection between the two. De Blasio, like Garcetti, has defended demonstrators, saying they were participating in a \"historical moment.\" \"I talked again with Dr. Ferrer about that this morning,\" Garcetti said, referencing Dr. Barbara Ferrer, the L.A. County public-health director. \"She does think some of the spread did come from our protests,\" he added. \"It’s not the act of protesting — that’s a great and American thing to do no matter what your opinion is... but protesting without maintaining physical distancing, without wearing your mask, without having sanitizer – we just have to be smart. Whether you’re at a protest or at your home, whether in your workplace or whether you’re out shopping, these rules don’t change.\" Cohen responded, \"Los Angeles is facing a resurgence; we have seen no such equivalent in New York City.\" DEMS WHO ENFORCED STRICT LOCKDOWNS ARE NOW ENCOURAGING 'BLM' MASS PROTESTS New York’s governor, however, Andrew Cuomo, in June expressed concerns about the confluence of protests and the virus. \"If you were at a protest, go get a test, please.\" But last month, after New York City hired 1,000 workers to conduct contact tracing to monitor the spread of coronavirus, de Blasio's office said they would not be explicitly asking people if they participated in the Black Lives Matter demonstrations. De Blasio's spokeswoman, at the time, said “no person will be asked proactively if they attended a protest.” Still, Cohen said this weekend that contact tracers were \"not barred from asking positive cases about attending protests,\" and that \"when identifying their close contacts, patients are asked if they attended any large gatherings or events.\" \"We remain overcautious,\" Cohen said. \"As we continue our phases reopening, we will continue to monitor our indicators closely for any potential resurgence.\" By contrast, a spokesperson for Carlos A. Giménez, the mayor of Miami-Dade County, told Fox News on Sunday the protests were a \"contributing factor\" to the local coronavirus spike. Giménez \"meets several times a week with his team of medical experts,\" the spokesperson, Patty Abril, responded in an email. \"Those experts have told him that, based on information in our local emergency rooms, the protests were a contributing factor, along with our community letting its guard down and not social distancing or wearing masks, as mandated. Graduation parties, house parties and restaurants illegally turning into clubs after midnight all contributed to the spike.\" IN FIERY MT. RUSHMORE ADDRESS, TRUMP CONDEMNS LEFT-WING FASCISTS, CALLS ON USA TO RISE UP The mayor had announced a curfew last week after it was determined that roughly 2,300 of Florida's 10,109 new coronavirus infections originated in Miami-Dade. “This curfew is meant to stop people from venturing out and hanging out with friends in groups, which has shown to be spreading the virus rapidly,” Giménez said in a statement. Meanwhile, Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan's office directed Fox News to city health official James Apa, who downplayed the role of protests while still acknowledging they may have played a role in some new cases. People march to protest during a solidarity rally for the death of George Floyd in Tokyo Sunday, June 14, 2020. Holding handmade signs that read “Black Lives Matter,” several hundred people marched peacefully at a Tokyo park Sunday, highlighting the outrage over the death of Floyd even in a country often perceived as homogeneous and untouched by racial issues. (AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko) \"No single exposure site has been the primary driver for our increase in cases,\" Apa said. \"Top contributors include infections from other people in households, essential workers being exposed on the job and infections within long term care facilities. From what we can tell, protests were not a major factor.\" Pressed on whether protests could have contributed to the coronavirus upswing, Apa indicated that any impact was probably marginal. \"A small percentage of the total number of cases reported going to a protest, which may or may not mean they acquired it there,\" he said. \"Protests are not driving our upsurge in cases.\" COURT DOCS ALLEGE ANTIFA 'RINGLEADER' LIT A CIGARETTE IN THE MONUMENTS' FLAMES The mayors of Atlanta, Minneapolis, San Diego, Washington, D.C., Oakland, San Francisco, Houston and New Orleans did not return Fox News' requests for comment concerning the potential that protests might have led to an increase in coronavirus cases. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, who did not return Fox News' request for comment as to whether he sees a connection between protests and the coronavirus, had previously warned that in-person worship services would be a \"public-health disaster,\" disregarding constituents' concerns that he was violating their First Amendment rights. In May, his administration began distributing masks to rioters, even though public gatherings of 10 or more were still ostensibly banned. Frey also allowed a police station to burn, saying it was necessary to protect police and rioters. Video The mayor of Washington D.C., Muriel Bowser, who also did not return Fox News' inquiries on Sunday, vowed $5,000 fines or 90 days in jail for anyone violating stay-at-home orders. Weeks later, though, Bowser defended the protests: \"We are grieving hundreds of years of institutional racism. ... People are tired, sad, angry and desperate for change.\" The mayor of Atlanta, Keisha Lance Bottoms, has been one of the few politicians to attempt to keep up her coronavirus admonitions. \"If you were out protesting last night, you probably need to go get a COVID test this week,\" she told CNN at the height of the protests. \"There is still a pandemic in America that’s killing Black and Brown people at higher numbers.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The mayor didn't answer Fox News' questions on the spread of the coronavirus, but she did deliver emotional remarks on Sunday after an 8-year-old girl was shot and killed on the Fourth of July near a Wendy's that became a flashpoint of recent anti-police protests in the city. “Enough is enough,\" Bottoms said. \"Enough is enough. We have talked about this movement that's happening across America and this moment in time when we have the ears and the interests of people across this country and across this globe who are saying they want to see change. But the difference in this moment in time with the civil rights movement -- the civil rights movement, there was a defined, common enemy. We're fighting the enemy within when we are shooting each other up on our streets.\" She continued: \"You shot and killed a baby. And there wasn’t just one shooter; there were at least two shooters. An eight-year-old baby. If you want people to take us seriously, and you don't want us to lose this movement, then we can't lose each other.\" \"It has to stop,\" Bottoms added, according to FOX 5 Atlanta. \"You can't blame this on police officers. It's about people who shot a baby in a car. We're doing each other more harm than any officer on this force.\" An Atlanta police officer currently faces a potential death penalty sentence for killing a black man who attempted to shoot the officer with his own taser during a DUI stop; that officer's stepmother later spoke to Fox News about why she was fired from her job as well.

      "Headline:  Tucker Carlson: Black Lives Matter is now a powerful political party ...\n",
      "############\n",
      "Article:  Tucker: Black Lives Matter is now a political party America went insane over the weekend. That's barely an overstatement. People in their 80s who have lived in the U.S. all their lives said they've never seen anything like it. Ask an 80-year-old. This was without precedent in the modern era. A small group of highly aggressive emotionally charged activists took over our culture. They forced the entire country to obey their will. It all happened so fast and with such ferocity that virtually no one resisted it. NAACP PRESIDENT DECLINES TO ENDORSE ‘DEFUND POLICE’ MOVEMENT People seem bewildered, even stunned by what was happening. Statements of fact and opinion that were entirely within the bounds of reasonable conversation just last Sunday, suddenly, a week later, were enough to get you fired from your job. And a number of people were fired. An awful lot happened this weekend. We want to assess the aftermath of it all, suggest what it may mean, and where this country is likely to go from here. But first, we want to give you a sense of what happened. We're going to begin in Minneapolis, where the Black Lives Matter riots first began almost two weeks ago. As the violence there raged, some Democratic leaders in Minneapolis came to a conclusion that didn't, on the surface anyway, make intuitive sense. What their city really needs, they decided, is less law enforcement -- in fact, no law enforcement. So, they began to demand that Minneapolis \"defund the police.\" Now, the first thing you notice about this idea is how unpopular with the public it is. Almost nobody in the country supports it. But the activists, undeterred, kept pushing the idea, and within days, pressure mounted on the mayor of Minneapolis, Jacob Frey, to get rid of his city's police department. This was a problem for Frey. Frey has greater political aspirations. And this was the last conversation he wanted to have. So, Frey did his best to change the subject with a mix of manic enthusiasm, and feigned empathy. Frey is well-practiced in those areas. Here he is a couple of years ago with his preferred brand of community outreach - dancing with his constituents. It didn't work -- then or now. Activists wanted actual answers. So Mayor Frey tried step two in the process -- groveling. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey: I've been coming to grips with my own brokenness in this situation, my own failures, my own shortcomings and I know there needs to be deep-seated -- Unidentified female: [Expletive] Again, good try, \"brokenness.\" It sounds like a sermon; give a raise to the staffer who scripted that. But again, no dice. Black Lives Matter, to their credit, wanted a real answer to their question. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER It was then that Jacob Frey made a fatal mistake. He put himself in a position where he could be asked that question directly. Here is what happened next? Unidentified male: ... Reelection next year. If he says no, that's what [bleep] we're going to do next. Unidentified female: Yes or no, will you commit to defunding Minneapolis Police Department? Frey: The abolition of it? Unidentified female: What did I say? We don't want no more police. Frey: No more. Unidentified female: Is that clear? Frey: I do not support the full abolition of the police department. Unidentified female: [Expletive]. You're wasting our time. Get the [expletive] out of here. Crowd (chanting): Go home, Jacob. Go home, Jacob. Go home. Go home, Jacob. Go home. Go home, Jacob. Go home. What a remarkable piece of tape that is. Has a big city mayor in this country ever been more thoroughly humiliated? \"Get the F out of here,\" she screams. \"Go!\" Well, the correct answer to that, needless to say, is, \"Up yours, lady. I'm not going anywhere. I run this city.\" Do you doubt that the entire crowd would have cheered Jacob Frey if he had said that? People always admire resolve even when they disagree with the point of view. But that's not what Jacob Frey did. Frey slunk away like a child caught doing something filthy. The most telling moment, though, came just before that, when the woman in sunglasses threatened to defeat the mayor in the next election. What does that tell you? It tells you that Black Lives Matter is in fact a political party, maybe the strongest political party in the United States. Its members believe they can reshape this country and so far, they're proving to be right. You can always tell which political movements are ascendant, which are headed up, by how straightforward their members and sympathizers are about what they believe. Strong people say what they think out loud. They have no reason not to. They're not embarrassed about their beliefs. They think they're winning. In the future, the left envisions, the only people who will have guns are people on their team, and that's exactly what defund the police really means. It means a woke militia policing our cities, enforcing Democratic Party orthodoxy. With that in mind, watch this clip from CNN Monday morning. This is the president of the Minneapolis City Council, Lisa Bender. Bender explains that the desire for safety, the desire not to, for example, have your home invaded by violent criminals, is in fact a sign of racism. Alisyn Camerota, CNN anchor: Do you understand that the word \"dismantle\" or \"police-free\" also makes some people nervous. For instance, what if in the middle of the night, my home is broken into. Who do I call? Lisa Bender, president of the Minneapolis City Council: Yes. I mean, I hear that loud and clear from a lot of my neighbors. And I know and myself, too, and I know that that comes from a place of privilege because for those of us for whom the system is working, I think we need to step back and imagine what it would feel like to already live in that reality, where calling the police may mean more harm is done. \"Hello, police? Armed men are breaking into my home. Help!\" \"Shut up, racist. Click.\" That's the world Lisa Bender is calling for. How many people watching CNN this morning as they got dressed agreed with Lisa Bender? Sure, that sounds reasonable. Calling the police during a break-in definitely qualifies as racism. It's hard to believe even among CNN's audience that very many people thought that --  it's so obviously nuts. On the other hand, it doesn't really matter at this point what the public thinks about anything. In the case of this idea, many Democratic leaders are already sold on it. Here's former congressman Keith Ellison on MSNBC over the weekend. Keep in mind as you watch him speak that Ellison is now the chief law enforcement officer in Minnesota. He is the attorney general. Ellison argues that it's wrong for police to bring guns to domestic violence calls. Seriously. Keith Ellison, attorney general of Minnesota: We send out people with guns, and they are there to use deadly force no matter what the problem may be. If the problem is sexual assault, we send somebody with a gun. If the problem is domestic violence, we send somebody with a gun. If the problem is somebody with a mental health crisis, we send somebody with a gun. Okay, we know what you're thinking. That's Keith Ellison, kind of an unfair example. Ellison has long been a crazy person who was once attached to the Nation of Islam. Back then, he called himself Keith Hakeem. More recently, Ellison endorsed Antifa. Yes, that's all true. But unlike other race-baiting extremists, Keith Ellison may have a promising political future. It's very easy to imagine it. If Joe Biden wins, Keith Ellison could be the attorney general of the United States. At the very least, he would be first in line to become U.S. attorney for the State of Minnesota, the top federal prosecutor there. What would happen then? We may live to find out. Again, all of this probably strikes you as wild-eyed craziness, flat Earth stuff. Eliminate the police? Really? But things change fast. Look how quickly they changed just over the weekend. Democrats have no intention of abolishing the police. Listen carefully and you will hear them admit that. Instead, they want to replace the police -- take the people who currently have badges, many of whom, by the way, voted for Donald Trump and swap them out for new people, people who hate Donald Trump and hate the people who voted for Donald Trump. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who is a skilled trend spotter if there ever was one, is already acting as if defund the police -- again, a proposal that no sane person even mentioned in public just last month -- is now the defining civil rights issue of our time. You'd have to be a bigoted dinosaur, a bad person, to oppose it. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.: This is one of those moments. This, right now, is one of those moments. So, if you're an elected official that for any reason is on this call, I'm asking you to ask yourself, what are you willing to sacrifice to make sure that overfunded police departments are defunded? So think about what you just saw. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez isn't just a member of Congress. She is maybe the most famous member of Congress. She is also a surrogate for Joe Biden. So, a lot is on the line here. Ocasio-Cortez didn't say that accidentally. She had a reason for saying it. Why did she say that? What is going on here? Well, as usual, the truth bears no resemblance whatsoever to what they're telling you. Think about it for just a second. Democratic politicians control the police departments of virtually every big city in this country. Now, they're telling you they want to get rid of those police departments. If they did, that would mean less power for themselves. So, right away, you know, there's lying going on. Democrats do not relinquish power voluntarily, ever. Period. Republicans frequently do. Democrats never do. So, that's the first thing to know. Something obviously is going on here beneath the surface. This has to be an attempt to increase the power of the Democratic Party because every policy they push is always. And in fact, that's exactly what's happening here. Democrats have no intention of abolishing the police. Listen carefully and you will hear them admit that. Instead, they want to replace the police -- take the people who currently have badges, many of whom, by the way, voted for Donald Trump and swap them out for new people, people who hate Donald Trump and hate the people who voted for Donald Trump. That's what's actually happening here, and it makes sense. Law enforcement is one of the very few institutions remaining in this country that the left has not yet controlled. Democrats hate the police because they don't control the police. Very simple. Remember 35 years ago when Democrats were constantly attacking the U.S. military? We don't hear that anymore. Why is that? It's very simple. The left took over the Pentagon. No reason to attack people you control, which they do. And they plan to do the same thing to your local police department. Let's be clear: What Democrats are proposing isn't some form of radical libertarianism with the cops leaving citizens to police their own neighborhoods. No, it's the opposite of that. What they're proposing is a power grab. Defund the police is a move toward authoritarian social control, cloaked in the language of identity politics. Already, in the middle of a total breakdown of law and order as we watch our cities burn, you are seeing new moves to prevent you from defending yourself and your family in the middle of it. Just last Tuesday, Marjorie Greene, who is running for Congress in Georgia, posted this ad on Facebook and within two days, Facebook pulled it down. Marjorie Greene, running for Georgia's 14th Congressional District: I have a message for Antifa terrorists. Stay the hell out of Northwest Georgia. You won't burn our churches, loot our businesses or destroy our homes. Here's the new rule and it defines everything: You are not allowed to question Black Lives Matter in any way. Full stop. That rule has been enforced without mercy everywhere and not just in this country. So, Facebook has a policy against violence --n not the violence engulfing our cities, but the violence of you defending your family. They create the chaos, you're not allowed to defend yourself. You are, in other words -- and this is, of course, the point -- wholly dependent upon them. In the future, the left envisions, the only people who will have guns are people on their team, and that's exactly what defund the police really means. It means a woke militia policing our cities, enforcing Democratic Party orthodoxy. Imagine if the Diversity Inclusion Department at Brown University had the power to arrest you. Imagine if the Black Lives Matter rioters had weapons and immunity from prosecution. That's what they're talking about. Partisan law enforcement and partisan law enforcement, incidentally, is hardly without precedent. In fact, it's the rule in the third world. This is an attempt to bring it here. What is again striking is how few American voters support this, very few. Polling from just a week ago shows that only 16 percent of Americans favored cutting funding to police departments. There was almost no party divide on that question surprisingly. The numbers were virtually the same for Republicans and Democrats. The divide was economic. If you make more than $100,000.00 a year, you are more than twice as likely to think cutting the police was a good idea. And there's no mystery there, of course; rich people live in safe places. They can afford their own security. Jeff Bezos doesn't need the police, he has got his own. Unfortunately for the rest of us -- and it is unfortunate --  Jeff Bezos and people like him are the only ones allowed to talk right now. It's hard to overstate how vicious the crackdown on free speech and free thought has been in the last few days. Here's the new rule and it defines everything: You are not allowed to question Black Lives Matter in any way. Full stop. That rule has been enforced without mercy everywhere and not just in this country. In Vancouver, a men's basketball coach was fired for liking a tweet that questioned Black Lives Matter. Meanwhile, a player on the LA Galaxy -- that's the professional soccer team in Los Angeles -- was fired because his wife said something critical online. Not him, he didn't do it. His wife. It doesn't matter. They canned the player anyway. Imagine being a high school student right now. High school students who refuse to show affirmative support for Black Lives Matter on their Instagram accounts were shunned by their friends. Journalists who asked too many questions about the group were fired or silenced. Again, not an exaggeration. Now, you'd think people in the media would resent this; presumably, some do. But almost everybody stayed quiet about it. They were too afraid, and some applauded. The New York Times ran an op-ed demanding that people disown their own families if their families failed to support Black Lives Matter enthusiastically enough. \"Tell your relatives, tell your friends,\" the author wrote .\"You will not be visiting or answering phone calls until they take significant action in supporting black lives through protest or financial contributions.\" Got that? Sorry, mom. I know you're old and alone and miss your grandchildren. But we are shunning you until you send more money to Black Lives Matter. In an environment like this -- we've never lived in an environment like this. But you can imagine, in an environment like this, most people get the message very fast and the weak ones are quick to join in just like the good l Red Guards they have always been underneath it all. Here's Mitt Romney on the march. Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah: We need to end violence and brutality and to make sure that people understand that black lives matter. Mitt just wants to make sure that Americans understand, get through their thick heads, that black lives matter, as if Americans didn't know that. But accusing your entire country of racism turns out to be a pretty small price for someone like Mitt Romney. What Romney is really worried about -- what all the finance moguls funding this movement are worried about -- is that someone somewhere will ask the obvious questions. How much have you, Mitt Romney personally made? How rich have you become by sending jobs overseas -- working-class jobs? By charging obscene interest rates and by otherwise harming poor and black communities economically? All the basic crimes are economic. Mitt Romney doesn't want to talk about that at all. So he marches. And Black Lives Matter couldn't be happier about it. The complicity of people like Mitt Romney gives groups like Black Lives Matter strength. Black Lives Matter is becoming more powerful by the hour and they know it. Watch this interview from Saturday in which a Black Lives Matter activist cheerfully admits he may soon incinerate people with gasoline. Activist: I am a leader of this FTP Movement. It means a lot of things. It can mean \"free the people.\" It can be \"for the people.\" It can also mean \"fire to property.\" We hope in de Blasio and Cuomo -- come on, talk to us and give the youth some direction. But if they don't, then next up is a Diamond District, and gasoline, thanks to Trump, is awfully cheap. The amazing thing is not just that he said that, though that's shocking enough. The amazing thing is that he said it on television live. He wasn't worried about being arrested. He's not like you at all. You're still not allowed to attend church services or go to big weddings. Too bad you're not friends with D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser. You could do anything. If this is so good for Republicans, explain this: Why does the latest round of national polls indicate that Joe Biden's lead in this race is growing? Bowser has renamed a park near the White House \"Black Lives Matter Plaza,\" and nobody criticized her for it. MSNBC practically sent her flowers. Jonathan Capehart, Washington Post editorial writer: Having a mural, Black Lives Matter, in huge block letters across three blocks leading up to the White House. As I said to you on Sunday, badass move that you made. Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser: The Black Lives Matter mural is a representation of an expression of our saying no, but also identifying and claiming a part of our city that had been taken over by federal forces. Mayor Bowser was buoyed and gratified by the support she received from our friends over on MSNBC, so she also had Black Lives Matter painted in enormous yellow letters on 16th Street in downtown D.C. Kind of a bold move if you think about it, making a street partisan. Imagine a big city mayor naming a major thoroughfare NRA Avenue or Planned Parenthood Boulevard. You think they would say something about it? It's impressive, in a way, but Black Lives Matter wasn't satisfied by it, not even close. The D.C. Chapter of the group released a statement attacking Mayor Bowser for not giving them complete control of the city's police department: \"This is to appease white liberals while ignoring our demands. Black Lives Matter means defund the police.\" Got that? Black Lives Matter means defund the police. Oh, so that's what Black Lives Matter means. No one really explains that. That's their description, and now we know what Intel and Pepsi and Amazon are supporting when they send money -- defunding the police. More from Opinion Cal Thomas: Trump and African-Americans – these are the actions he must take now Donna Brazile: Justice in Policing Act – what's in this historic bill and why it must pass now Sens. Cotton and Blackburn: Stop depending on China — here's how we end this threat Suddenly, it feels like all the adults have gone to St. Barts and turned off their cell phones. Who is running this country? Who is in charge? Anyone? Yet, amazingly, some Republicans in Washington seem almost giddy as they watch the country go insane. Democrats have gone too far this time, they'll tell you. We're guaranteed to win in November. You've probably gotten texts to that effect recently from friends. It sounds good, but they are wrong. They're totally and completely wrong on many levels. For one thing, if you care about it, a country, you've got to try. You have an obligation to try your very best to protect and defend it, no matter who is helped in November. That's what patriotism is. It's not about you, it's about America. But leave aside your moral duty, even as a matter of pure politics. This is a mindless analysis. It is a stupid calculation. Bad ideas are like cancer. When you ignore them, when you pretend they're not there, when you just assume, just ride it out, they spread. Most people, as we noted, currently oppose defunding the police. That's where the polls stand right now. But will they feel that way in three months? How about in three weeks? In an environment like this, you don't know. Things move fast. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell once opposed mocking the American flag, kneeling to attack the country as racist. Now, Goodell has announced, he is with Black Lives Matter. Roger Goodell, NFL Commissioner: We at the National Football League admit we were wrong for not listening to NFL players earlier and encourage all to speak out and peacefully protest. We at the National Football League believe Black Lives Matter. I personally protest with you. So, if this is so good for Republicans, explain this: Why does the latest round of national polls indicate that Joe Biden's lead in this race is growing? And that's not a small thing if you plan to live here. If you don't want to live under Attorney General Keith Ellison, so why is it happening? Maybe it's because Republicans in Washington have decided to sit this crisis out. They haven't bothered to explain what's wrong. They haven't bothered to tell us anything about what might be flawed about Black Lives Matter, and they don't plan to by the way. They're too cynical. They're too fearful. If Democratic leaders cared about saving the lives of black people -- and they should -- they wouldn't ignore the murder of thousands of young black men in their cities every year. They wouldn't put abortion clinics in black neighborhoods. They're going to pretend like it's not happening, repeat platitudes. Read bumper stickers on the air, nod solemnly and do nothing to protect the country. Why would voters reward that? Democrats, by contrast, who are completely wrong, and in fact are leading us down a path that won't end well, are not ashamed in the slightest of what they believe. Day in and day out, they brag about it. Just on Monday, they kneeled in Washington in submission before Black Lives Matter. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi: We are here to honor George Floyd. For those who wish to, we will now kneel for our moment of silence. Nancy Pelosi doing something crazy again. Before you comfort yourself with that thought, keep in mind it wasn't just Nancy Pelosi, not by a longshot. Members of the National Guard kneeled, too. So did a group of FBI agents. So did the Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, who just the other day was wearing blackface. Now, he is with Black Lives Matter. The police chief of Webster, Massachusetts went even further than that. He lay on the ground before them in complete submission. And then things began to spin completely out of control, not just in this country but throughout the West. As the crowd swelled, and the demand for total ideological conformity grew louder, this latest cultural revolution became a parody of itself, as they always do. Tell the truth -- and the truth is, this is a good country. Better than any other. Of course, we are flawed, but we are trying, unlike most places. And we have nothing to be ashamed of -- none of us. Immigrants know that best of all. That's why they come here -- a million new Americans every year. They're not coming because America is a racist country. They're coming because it's not. In London, protesters vandalized the statue of Abraham Lincoln -- because what did Abraham Lincoln ever do for black people? In Boston, a mob defaced a monument to the first all-black volunteer regiment in the Civil War. Because black people dying to end slavery sounds like white supremacy to us. Right around the same time, a law professor from the University of Chicago called for an armed coup to overthrow the president of the United States, but that didn't get a lot of press because it didn't seem particularly newsworthy under the circumstances. It was that kind of weekend. What is going on? What is this about? Even the outlines are blurry at this point, but we know this: No matter what they tell you, it has very little to do with black lives. If only it did. If Democratic leaders cared about saving the lives of black people -- and they should -- they wouldn't ignore the murder of thousands of young black men in their cities every year. They wouldn't put abortion clinics in black neighborhoods. They would instead do their very best to improve the public schools and to encourage intact families, which we know beyond a shadow of a doubt is central to the life prospects of children. If they tried to make black neighborhoods as safe as their own neighborhoods, they would close the payday lenders that have added so much misery to the lives of poor people of all colors. But they don't even consider doing any of this -- they don't even try. Instead, they encourage theft and mayhem as if that will help. It will not help. This may be a lot of things, this moment we're living through, but it is definitely not about black lives, and remember that when they come for you. And at this rate, they will. Anyone who has ever been subjected to the rage of the mob knows the feeling. It's like being swarmed by hornets. You cannot think clearly. And the temptation is to panic. Video But you can't panic. You've got to keep your head and tell the truth. Tell the truth. If you show weakness of any kind, they will crush you. Ask Drew Brees. By some accounts, poor Drew Brees is on his fourth apology for the crime of defending the American flag. He decided to apologize and now, they are using him as a propaganda work in hostage tape after hostage tape. At a moment like this, there is no advantage in cowardice, in being Mitt Romney. You think you're saving yourself? You're just empowering the worst people -- people who hate you. Before you know it, you're confessing to crimes you didn't commit. Don't start. Tell the truth -- and the truth is, this is a good country. Better than any other. Of course, we are flawed, but we are trying, unlike most places. And we have nothing to be ashamed of -- none of us. Immigrants know that best of all. That's why they come here -- a million new Americans every year. They're not coming because America is a racist country. They're coming because it's not. That's all true. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP And in our clear moments, we know it's true, even the people claiming it's not. Truth is a defense. No matter what they're telling you at this moment, this moment will pass. Remember that. All moments do. When it does, we will look back at what we just saw in horror and disbelief. But if you're honest now, you will keep your dignity, and ultimately you will be very glad about that. Life is not worth living without it.

Pink is posing a question. Since last week, the singer has been very vocal in her support of the Black Lives Matter movement, sharing several posts to Instagram sporting the hashtag and encouraging donations. On Wednesday, the \"So What\" singer, 40, again addressed her beliefs in a video she shared on Twitter. LIZZO, JOHN LEGEND, JANE FONDA AND MORE CELEBS SIGN 'OPEN DEMAND' LETTER TO DEFUND THE POLICE \"How can anyone call themselves a patriot or an American if you re-elect a president that doesn't govern, respect or represent half of our country?\" she said, referring to supporters of President Trump. \"That's not America. That's your America. That's not America.\" Pink went on to say that some \"worship the confederate flag, which is not our flag and it never will be.\" \"Or you're a hypocrite that doesn't actually understand the meaning of patriotism or what it means to be an American,\" she said with a shrug. \"Truth.\" ELLEN DEGENERES CRITICIZED FOR DELETED TWEET ABOUT PROTESTS SAYING 'PEOPLE OF COLOR' The star also made her position clear over the weekend, repeatedly shutting down All Lives Matter supporters in the comments on one of her Instagram posts. On Sunday, the singer shared a post initially written by Billie Eilish, in which Eilish, 18, explained her disdain for the All Lives Matter movement. In the comments, several of Pink's followers expressed their disagreement. “Totally get where you’re coming from,\" one fan said in the comments, per People magazine. “HOWEVER, as a person with a lawyer brain, I have to say … when you single out one race and say ‘that’ race matters. You ARE implicitly saying other races don’t matter as much. It is automatically inferred. I believe it does this situation a disjustice [sic] by putting it in the #blacklivesmatter category. This could happen to ANY ONE OF US! THAT is the atrocity! THAT is the REAL issue. It is not about race.” Pink responded: \"You are the epitome of white privilege and the saddest part is that you don’t even hear yourself and probably never will.\" When another commenter said \"All Business Owners Life's Matter too. [sic],\" Pink responded, saying they \"can't read.\" P!nk attends the 53rd annual CMA Awards at the Music City Center on November 13, 2019 in Nashville, Tenn.

Kate Beckinsale is taking a stand. On Wednesday, the actress shared a post on Instagram in honor of Breonna Taylor, an African-American woman killed by police officers in her home in Louisville, Ky., in March. The post, simply featuring a picture of Taylor's name, was originally shared by Gloria Steinem. GABRIELLE UNION FILES COMPLAINT AGAINST NBC AND 'AMERICA'S GOT TALENT' \"Dear Mayor Greg Fischer, I join thousands of others in asking you to bring posthumous justice to Breonna Taylor, who was shot eight times in her bed by the Louisville Metro Police after they invaded her apartment looking for a drug trafficker already in custody,\" the post's caption reads. \"Tamika Palmer is Breonna’s mother, and her small request in the face of huge injustice is easily within your power as Mayor and human being: 'I want justice for her. I want them to say her name.

Beckinsale, 46, was quick to respond to the commenter, shutting them down. \"What’s really sad is you being pushy on a post about a woman’s death and saying 'what about someone else' actually does a disservice to the person you are trying to illuminate,\" the \"Underworld\" actress said. \"It’s a f---ing tragedy too but you will stop people from honoring him since you are being mean spirited and co opting him with a slogan which offends.

      "Article:  Fox News Flash top headlines for June 8 Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Lights, camera… yikes. An Instagram influencer has reportedly apologized for staging a photo shoot at a recent Black Lives Matter protest, after being accused of exploiting the event for selfish gains. Whoops! We couldn't access this Tweet. Demonstrations decrying racism and police brutality have swept the nation following the police-involved death of George Floyd on May 25, and one Internet personality has been blasted as tone-deaf after posing for pictures at a Los Angeles protest, News.com.au reports. On Friday, video footage hit Twitter of influencer Kris Schatzel stepping into the crowd at the LA rally wearing a long black dress and holding a “Black Lives Matter” sign. Schatzel held up her skirt and touched her hair while posing for a photographer, as activists around her continued to march down the street. CALIFORNIA WOMAN SEEN POSING WITH POWER DRILL IN FRONT OF BOARDED-UP STORE GOES VIRAL, PROMPTS EXTREME BACKLASH “Oh no, look at her. Nuh uh,\" said a Twitter user who filmed the moment, in a post that has since been viewed 18.6 million times online. “Stop treating the protests like Coachella,” tweeted out Influencers in the Wild, when sharing the clip. Twitter users slammed Schatzel’s stunt as “disgusting” and frustrating, with one calling for internet influencers to be canceled altogether. According to the Daily Mirror, the Russian woman has since deleted her Twitter account and made her Instagram page –­ where she boasts a following of 238,000 –­ private. FOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS \"This is a huge misunderstanding!!! Later I will explain everything and apologize,” Schatzel reportedly wrote on her Instagram story, per the Mirror. \"My intentions was never to disrespect the movement but to add to the movement the way that I know how.

      "Headline:  Harvard grad says she'll 'stab' anyone who says 'all lives matter ...\n",
      "############\n",
      "Article:  Fox News Flash top headlines for July 1 Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. A recent Harvard University graduate claims she is getting death threats over a TikTok video she made in which she threatened to stab anyone who tells her that “all lives matter.” Claira Janover, who graduated in May with a degree in government and psychology, went viral after posting a short clip in which she attacked anyone with “the nerve, the sheer entitled Caucasity to say, ‘all lives matter.’” “I’ma stab you,” the Connecticut native said, zooming in close on her face. “I’ma stab you, and while you’re struggling and bleeding out, I’ma show you my paper cut and say, ‘My cut matters, too,’” she added. Ann Coulter was one of those who shared the clip, calling Janover an “Asian Karen,” while many others called for the student’s arrest. “This woman is threatening people, who knows what she is capable of,” someone called Mr. Len wrote in reply. “Does this not count as violent speech? I guess it only counts when it fits the narrative,” another follower asked on Twitter. By Tuesday, Janover had removed the original video — but posted updates responding to the “insane” reaction that included numerous death threats, she said. “Story time for why the Department of Homeland might be monitoring my name right now,” she started one of the updates. Janover claimed the clip was “clearly” an “analogous joke,” pointing out that she even posted a message with it explicitly stating: “For legal reasons this is a joke.” “And people are like reporting me for domestic terrorism, tagging the FBI, Harvard, Cambridge police,” she said. “Apparently I’m threatening the lives of people — unlike cops, obviously,” she said. “Anyway, so If I get an email from the Department of Homeland Security or I get kicked out of Harvard or I get arrested or whatever — or I get murdered, according to the many death threats that I’m receiving right now — know that I appreciate you guys standing up for me,” she said as she posted a series of supportive messages. THIS UNIVERSITY CONSIDERS NAME CHANGE AS CRITICS NOTE SLAVERY CONNOTATIONS In an earlier post, she had laughed over many of the angry responses her TikTok got — including one suggesting she could be a Chinese spy with a Western-sounding name to help infiltrate the U.S. One called her the c-word, while another wrote, “Maybe someone should stab her for being oppressive! She is the problem, and all like her!” “They quite literally did blow up my Twitter,” she said. Just before midnight Tuesday, Janover tweeted about the “death, rape, expulsion, and firing threats” she got. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP “I will not be silenced, shamed, or threatened into silence by bigoted trump fans who don’t understand analogies,” she wrote. Her message received a lot of support — along with numerous replies of “all lives matter,” with some telling her, “You reap what you sow.” This story first appeared in the New York Post.\n",
