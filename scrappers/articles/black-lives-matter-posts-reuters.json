REUTERS/Axel Schmidt\nSocial media users have been sharing an image online that makes several disparaging and false claims about George Soros. Some of these claims include Soros being a former Nazi, Soros \u201cswearing to destroy the U.S.A.\u201d, Soros owning ANTIFA and Black Lives Matter, and Soros paying for protesters. Examples can be seen here and here. \nGeorge Soros is a billionaire philanthropist and founder of Open Society Foundations. He has been the target of multiple conspiracy theories and misinformation on social media (here). Previous Reuters fact checks debunking claims about Soros can be found here and here. \nOpen Society Foundations told Reuters via email that the claims made toward Soros in these posts are \u201cfalse\u201d and \u201cdo a disservice to the very bedrock of our democracy, as enshrined in the First Amendment.\u201d\nSOROS IS NOT A FORMER NAZI\nReuters debunked a false claim that a photograph shows a young Soros in a Nazi uniform (here). During the time Nazis were active, Soros would not have met the age requirements to be in the Schutzstaffel. Soros and his family were Hungarian Jews who lived in Budapest during the war, disguising their identities for safety. In 1947 at the age of 17, Soros moved to London to attend university (more  here). \nBy the time Soros was 17, the fall of Nazi Germany had already happened. Soros could not possibly have been involved in the Nazi party which was active between 1920-1945. He is also a Hungarian Jew, further disproving this theory. In a 1998 60 Minutes interview (youtu.be/AiqHiQYuoOs) Soros says his father forged his family\u2019s identity to protect them. Soros, as a teenager, was placed under custody of a government official with the premise of being his godson. During this time, Soros witnessed (but did not actively participate in) the confiscation of Jewish property (here). In the interview, Soros says he doesn\u2019t feel guilt looking back at these events, mentioning that he was a child at the time and that he was a \u201cspectator\u201d to something that would have happened regardless of his presence.\nSOROS NEVER SWORE TO \u201cDESTROY THE USA\u201d\nReuters found no evidence of Soros ever saying this. Other fact checkers have also debunked this specific \u201cquote\u201d (here, here).\nAn older version of the quote attributes it to a Newsweek interview but there is no evidence Soros said this in their archive. One article quotes Steve Bannon comparing politics to war, saying, \u201cThey fight, look at [George] Soros and these other NGOs...they destroy you.\u201d The article also states that, according to Bannon, Soros threatened to \u201cdestroy him personally.\u201d (here).\nSOROS DOES NOT \u201cOWN\u201d ANTIFA AND BLACK LIVES MATTER\nGeorge Soros does not \u201cown\u201d ANTIFA or Black Lives Matter.\nA spokesperson for Open Society Foundations told Reuters via email: \u201cWe proudly support organizations that promote civic engagement and champion the right of all Americans to petition their government for redress of grievances. Those protesting the death of Mr. Floyd and police brutality across the nation do so out of a deep and abiding concern for country; they don\u2019t do so for pay from these foundations or any other, as some cynics claim.\u201d\nBlack Lives Matter is a largely horizontal, grassroots, global organization (https://\u202fbit.ly/373z22H). Its co-founders, Opal Tometi, Patrisse Cullors, and Alicia Garza started the movement in 2013, after the death of Trayvon Martin. The co-founders recently told the New Yorker that Black Lives Matter \u201chas always been somewhat decentralized\u201d and operates in a horizontal manner: \u201cWe have always said the power goes on in the local chapter because they know what is going on\u201d.\nThe organization recently set up a $12 million grant to help organizations fighting institutional racism, after an upsurge in donations amid the current protests. Beyonc\u00e9 and Prince are among the celebrities who have donated to Black Lives Matter in previous years (here). \nOpen Society Foundations donates to groups worldwide (here). Some of their previous donations - including to Black Lives Matter and Planned Parenthood - have been subject to controversy in the U.S. (here, here). It is unclear if the foundation has donated to Black Lives Matter again in the last month.  \nAntifa, short for \u201canti-fascist,\u201d is an amorphous movement whose adherents oppose people or groups they consider authoritarian or racist, often using aggressive tactics, according to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), which monitors extremists (here). Horizontal in nature and largely lacking official organization, it is unclear how Antifa is funded, if at all (  here  ).\nSOROS DID NOT PAY FOR PROTESTERS AFTER TRUMP\u2019S ELECTION\nFollowing Trump\u2019s 2016 election win, some far-right claims suggested actors including Soros funded the \u2018Not My President\u2019 protests. Open Society Foundations denied paying these protesters in any way (here, here). \nSoros has been mistakenly accused of sponsoring protests after Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s Supreme Court appointment and protests against racism in Ferguson, Missouri (here, here). \nOpen Society Foundations recently explained in a tweet: \u201cWe do not pay protesters. Neither does our founder George Soros. Claims that we do serve to delegitimize those who are exercising their Constitutionally-protected right to protest peacefully and petition their government for redress of grievances.\u201d (here) \nVERDICT\nFalse. Conspiracy theories about George Soros visible in this post are unfounded.\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.

Human Rights Office in Honduras.\nThe deadly plight faced by Honduran activists made headlines in 2016 following the murder of renowned indigenous rights advocate Berta Caceres that sparked global outrage.\nCaceres was shot by gunmen in her home after receiving death threats over her opposition to a hydroelectric dam project.\nLast year, a Honduran court handed down jail terms of up to five decades for seven men convicted of her murder.\nCOURT RULING\nThe latest attack on Garifuna leaders marks an attempt to \u201cintimidate\u201d and \u201csilence\u201d their fight for land, Miranda said.\nAmong the Garifuna leaders abducted in Triunfo de la Cruz was 27-year-old Alberth Sneider Centeno.\nHe campaigned for Honduras to comply with a 2015 ruling by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACHR) over land disputes and the Garifunas\u2019 right to be properly consulted about planned projects on their lands in Triunfo de la Cruz.\nThe court found Honduras responsible for the violation of their collective ownership rights after the local municipal government sold Garifuna land to developers and said it had failed to carry out proper consultations with the community.\nIt ordered Honduras to compensate the Garifunas for their losses and to delineate their collective lands.\nBut five years later, OFRANEH and the U.N. say little progress has been made on putting the ruling into practice.\n\u201cTo date, the implementation of the said ruling by the state of Honduras continues to present challenges,\u201d the U.N. human rights office in Honduras said in a statement last week.\nConflicts over land in Garifuna communities stem from \u201cthe lack of granting of collective property titles in their traditional territory,\u201d said Jackeline Anchecta, vice minister of promotion at the human rights ministry.\nOfficials have been working to implement the ruling in Triunfo de la Cruz, where they have surveyed up to 70% of the land under dispute, she added.\nMeanwhile, Miranda says she fears for her own life after the lastest disappearance of fellow OFRANEH activists.\n\u201cToday more than ever, I\u2019m at risk,\u201d said Miranda. \u201cIt\u2019s a constant conflict. It\u2019s a non-declared war.\u201d\nReporting by Anastasia Moloney @anastasiabogota; Editing by Zoe Tabary.

REUTERS/Caitlin Ochs/File Photo\nFrom deploying federal agents to confront protesters in cities such as Portland, Oregon, to releasing ads portraying a lawless and dangerous America under a Biden presidency, Trump has positioned himself as the candidate who will keep the country safe.\nBut Reuters/Ipsos polling this month shows white suburban Americans are far more worried about the economy and healthcare than crime, a sign that Trump\u2019s strategy could be at odds with the priorities of the critical voting bloc he narrowly won in 2016 and must win back to secure a second term.\nAsked what is \u201cthe most important problem facing the United States today,\u201d 21% said the economy and 21% said healthcare. Only 6% said crime, according to the July 15-21 national opinion poll, which included 1,603 U.S. adults who identified as white and living in the suburbs.\nBut concern about COVID-19 and Trump\u2019s management of it ran deep.\nAmong white Americans in the suburbs, 81% said they were personally concerned about the spread of the virus. Forty-one percent of those suburban white Americans approved of the way Trump has handled the coronavirus, down 12 points from a similar poll that ran in March.\nWhile 42% of all Americans thought Biden would be better at dealing with COVID-19 compared with 33% who said Trump was better, white suburban Americans were more closely split over which candidate was better equipped to lead the nation out of the crisis, with 40% saying Trump and 38% saying Biden.\nThe data suggests Trump, who trails Biden in national polls, could shore up his support in the suburbs and improve his chances of winning the Nov. 3 election with stronger leadership on the health and economic crises rather than doubling down on assertions that the country would be less safe with Biden in the White House.\n\u201cHis law-and-order message seems more geared towards resuscitating his base than winning over swing suburbanites,\u201d said Dave Wasserman, a non-partisan analyst with the Cook Political Report. \u201cThere is no way Trump can win the election unless he turns around his numbers on the handling of COVID.\u201d\n\u2018EXTREMELY MOVING ISSUE\u2019\nThe Republican president\u2019s advisers insist his tough-on-crime message resonates with suburban voters after months of protests over racial injustice and police brutality against Black Americans and calls from progressives to \u201cdefund\u201d the police.\n\u201cThe violence, the lawlessness, is sickening. This is what Joe Biden and the Democrats stand for,\u201d said Rick Gorka, a senior member of the Republican National Committee and part of Trump\u2019s re-election campaign. \u201cOur data shows this is an extremely moving issue, especially with suburban voters and those that are undecided.\u201d\nGorka, who declined to share the data, said the president had been involved in the messaging and ad strategy.\nBiden does not support defunding police departments. Yet one Trump campaign television ad that portrays an older woman being attacked by burglars while she waits on hold trying to call emergency services ends with the slogan: \u201cYou won\u2019t be safe in Joe Biden\u2019s America.\u201d\n\u201cBiden will destroy your neighborhood and your American Dream,\u201d Trump said in a tweet directed to \u201cSuburban Housewives of America\u201d last week. \u201cI will preserve it, and make it even better!\u201d\nIn his latest bid for suburban support, Trump said on Wednesday his administration was rescinding an Obama-era regulation aimed at combating discriminatory housing practices and segregation.\nCritics attacked the move, with Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren describing it as \u201cracist fear-mongering.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s focus on fear echoes his 2016 campaign, when he depicted immigrants from Mexico as criminals. This time around, he warns of \u201canarchists and agitators\u201d whom he says Democratic-led cities have been unable to control.\nOregon\u2019s governor said on Wednesday the federal government had agreed to withdraw agents from Portland, while the Justice Department said it would send law enforcement officials to Cleveland, Milwaukee and Detroit - all in crucial battleground states - in an expansion of a separate program aimed at curtailing a surge of violent crime in some cities.\nKyle Kondik, a non-partisan analyst at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, believes Trump ordered federal police into Portland \u201cto create scary images for suburban voters.\u201d\n\u201cBut it\u2019s kind of beside the point. In order for the message to resonate, it needs to feel more relevant to more people,\u201d Kondik added.\nWINNING THE BASE, TOUGHER SELL IN SUBURBS\nAccording to Reuters/Ipsos polling, Trump\u2019s net approval in the suburbs declined by 17 percentage points from March to July as the coronavirus swept the country. Biden leads Trump by 11 points in the suburbs, up from a 6-point advantage four months ago.\nTrump is \u201cstoking confrontation and conflict\u201d to divert Americans\u2019 attention from his failed leadership on the pandemic, Biden spokesman TJ Ducklo said. \u201cClearly Americans aren\u2019t buying it.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s response to the anti-racism demonstrations was viewed favorably by Republicans in a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted on Monday and Tuesday, with 78% saying they approved, up from 67% in mid-June.\nSuburban voters were more suspicious of his motives. Some 44% of suburban Americans said they thought the federal agents were being used for political purposes, while 37% thought they were mostly there to restore law and order.\nMary Aponte, 38, a mother in suburban Bucks County, Pennsylvania, said she was not a Trump supporter but agreed police need support and criminals should face consequences.\n\u201cI fear for what will happen in major cities if we get Biden in office when it comes to the police,\u201d she said, adding she remained conflicted about her choice in November because she also has sympathy for the Black Lives Matter movement.\nTricia Kalmar, a 45-year-old suburban mother in Delaware, Ohio, said she did not think Trump\u2019s law-and-order messaging would work in her community.\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel like any of the moms here feel threatened by the protests,\u201d said Kalmar, who voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016 but has also regularly voted for Republicans. \u201cEven those who don\u2019t support the protests, they are not concerned about their safety here in the suburbs.\u201d\nReporting by Tim Reid; Additional reporting by Chris Kahn, Steve Holland and Jarrett Renshaw; Editing by Colleen Jenkins and Peter Cooney\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"url": "/article/idUSKCN24U1U1", "headline": "States can restrict protests on public health grounds, within reason, U.N. says", "published_date": "2020-07-30", "text": "By Emma Farge\n3 MIN READ\nGENEVA (Reuters) - Governments have the right to restrict protests on public health grounds, within reason, the U.N.

REUTERS/Caitlin Ochs/File Photo\nFrom deploying federal agents to confront protesters in cities such as Portland, Oregon, to releasing ads portraying a lawless and dangerous America under a Biden presidency, Trump has positioned himself as the candidate who will keep the country safe.\nBut Reuters/Ipsos polling this month shows white suburban Americans are far more worried about the economy and healthcare than crime, a sign that Trump\u2019s strategy could be at odds with the priorities of the critical voting bloc he narrowly won in 2016 and must win back to secure a second term.\nAsked what is \u201cthe most important problem facing the United States today,\u201d 21% said the economy and 21% said healthcare. Only 6% said crime, according to the July 15-21 national opinion poll, which included 1,603 U.S. adults who identified as white and living in the suburbs.\nBut concern about COVID-19 and Trump\u2019s management of it ran deep.\nAmong white Americans in the suburbs, 81% said they were personally concerned about the spread of the virus. Forty-one percent of those suburban white Americans approved of the way Trump has handled the coronavirus, down 12 points from a similar poll that ran in March.\nWhile 42% of all Americans thought Biden would be better at dealing with COVID-19 compared with 33% who said Trump was better, white suburban Americans were more closely split over which candidate was better equipped to lead the nation out of the crisis, with 40% saying Trump and 38% saying Biden.\nThe data suggests Trump, who trails Biden in national polls, could shore up his support in the suburbs and improve his chances of winning the Nov. 3 election with stronger leadership on the health and economic crises rather than doubling down on assertions that the country would be less safe with Biden in the White House.\n\u201cHis law-and-order message seems more geared towards resuscitating his base than winning over swing suburbanites,\u201d said Dave Wasserman, a non-partisan analyst with the Cook Political Report. \u201cThere is no way Trump can win the election unless he turns around his numbers on the handling of COVID.\u201d\n\u2018EXTREMELY MOVING ISSUE\u2019\nThe Republican president\u2019s advisers insist his tough-on-crime message resonates with suburban voters after months of protests over racial injustice and police brutality against Black Americans and calls from progressives to \u201cdefund\u201d the police.\n\u201cThe violence, the lawlessness, is sickening. This is what Joe Biden and the Democrats stand for,\u201d said Rick Gorka, a senior member of the Republican National Committee and part of Trump\u2019s re-election campaign. \u201cOur data shows this is an extremely moving issue, especially with suburban voters and those that are undecided.\u201d\nGorka, who declined to share the data, said the president had been involved in the messaging and ad strategy.\nBiden does not support defunding police departments. Yet one Trump campaign television ad that portrays an older woman being attacked by burglars while she waits on hold trying to call emergency services ends with the slogan: \u201cYou won\u2019t be safe in Joe Biden\u2019s America.\u201d\n\u201cBiden will destroy your neighborhood and your American Dream,\u201d Trump said in a tweet directed to \u201cSuburban Housewives of America\u201d last week. \u201cI will preserve it, and make it even better!\u201d\nIn his latest bid for suburban support, Trump said on Wednesday his administration was rescinding an Obama-era regulation aimed at combating discriminatory housing practices and segregation.\nCritics attacked the move, with Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren describing it as \u201cracist fear-mongering.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s focus on fear echoes his 2016 campaign, when he depicted immigrants from Mexico as criminals. This time around, he warns of \u201canarchists and agitators\u201d whom he says Democratic-led cities have been unable to control.\nOregon\u2019s governor said on Wednesday the federal government had agreed to withdraw agents from Portland, while the Justice Department said it would send law enforcement officials to Cleveland, Milwaukee and Detroit - all in crucial battleground states - in an expansion of a separate program aimed at curtailing a surge of violent crime in some cities.\nKyle Kondik, a non-partisan analyst at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, believes Trump ordered federal police into Portland \u201cto create scary images for suburban voters.\u201d\n\u201cBut it\u2019s kind of beside the point. In order for the message to resonate, it needs to feel more relevant to more people,\u201d Kondik added.\nWINNING THE BASE, TOUGHER SELL IN SUBURBS\nAccording to Reuters/Ipsos polling, Trump\u2019s net approval in the suburbs declined by 17 percentage points from March to July as the coronavirus swept the country. Biden leads Trump by 11 points in the suburbs, up from a 6-point advantage four months ago.\nTrump is \u201cstoking confrontation and conflict\u201d to divert Americans\u2019 attention from his failed leadership on the pandemic, Biden spokesman TJ Ducklo said. \u201cClearly Americans aren\u2019t buying it.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s response to the anti-racism demonstrations was viewed favorably by Republicans in a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted on Monday and Tuesday, with 78% saying they approved, up from 67% in mid-June.\nSuburban voters were more suspicious of his motives. Some 44% of suburban Americans said they thought the federal agents were being used for political purposes, while 37% thought they were mostly there to restore law and order.\nMary Aponte, 38, a mother in suburban Bucks County, Pennsylvania, said she was not a Trump supporter but agreed police need support and criminals should face consequences.\n\u201cI fear for what will happen in major cities if we get Biden in office when it comes to the police,\u201d she said, adding she remained conflicted about her choice in November because she also has sympathy for the Black Lives Matter movement.\nTricia Kalmar, a 45-year-old suburban mother in Delaware, Ohio, said she did not think Trump\u2019s law-and-order messaging would work in her community.\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel like any of the moms here feel threatened by the protests,\u201d said Kalmar, who voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016 but has also regularly voted for Republicans. \u201cEven those who don\u2019t support the protests, they are not concerned about their safety here in the suburbs.\u201d\nReporting by Tim Reid; Additional reporting by Chris Kahn, Steve Holland and Jarrett Renshaw; Editing by Colleen Jenkins and Peter Cooney\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"url": "/article/idUSKCN24V1B8", "headline": "Australia revamps strategy to tackle poor Aboriginal outcomes", "published_date": "2020-07-30", "text": "By Reuters Staff\n3 MIN READ\nMELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia will broaden measures to improve life outcomes for its Indigenous people, it said on Thursday, after efforts over the past decade did little to budge their shorter life expectancy, worse health prospects and higher rate of incarceration.\nFederal and state governments have signed on to 10-year targets in a revamped strategy to \u201cClose the Gap\u201d between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians which includes a commitment to tackle structural racism in government organisations and establish accountability mechanisms.\nThe life expectancy of Indigenous Australians is eight years shorter than for non-Indigenous people at 72 years for men and 76 years for women.

That it is not fair,\u201d Washington told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nDubbed the \u201cQueen of Urban Farming\u201d, Washington co-founded Black Urban Growers, an organisation supporting farmers working in urban and rural settings, and also started Rise & Root Farm.\nGreenhouses and rows of crops and flowers stretch across the women-led market garden in Chester, New York, which supplies organic vegetables, herbs and bouquets to buyers in the city.\nPotted seedlings are on sale too for beginners wanting to turn their balconies or yards into vegetable patches.\n\u2018BAD FOOD, LACK OF FOOD\u2019\nWhile the struggle for \u201cfood justice\u201d is decades-old, the coronavirus pandemic has exposed how racial inequalities still make it harder for many Black Americans to eat well, affecting their health and ultimately cutting some lives short.\nPreliminary data from several states has shown that COVID-19 is killing African Americans at a higher rate.\nHuman rights campaigners say that likely reflects both poorer underlying health with Black Americans more likely to have heart disease, diabetes and high blood pressure as well as reduced access to healthcare.\n\u201cThe bad food, the lack of food, the health disparities, the life expectancy, the incarceration rates, the violence, all of those pieces are all connected to the economic system and who has power,\u201d said Erika Allen, co-founder and chief executive at the Chicago-based Urban Growers Collective.\nBut food production has not always been an almost exclusively white endeavour in the United States.\nIn 2017, 95% of the country\u2019s nearly 3.4 million farmers were white, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) census released last year.\nBlack farmers accounted for 1.3% or 45,508, compared to the 1920s when their numbers peaked at 925,708.\nPeople of color hold 3% of the country\u2019s agricultural land, according to a 2014 government survey on tenure and ownership.\nLeah Penniman, co-director of Soul Fire Farm, an urban growing collective based in Petersburg, New York, said the fall in the number of Black farmers reflected decades of discrimination and a backlash over an estimated 16 million acres (6.5 million hectares) of land they owned in 1910.\n\u201cRacism and white supremacy are really built into the DNA of the U.S. food system,\u201d said Penniman, author of a book called \u201cFarming While Black\u201d.\nShe said the same thinking that justified the theft of indigenous lands and the use of slaves as farm labour morphed over decades into new forms of racial discrimination in the country\u2019s food production chain.\nThousands of Black farmers who said they were racially discriminated against for decades by the USDA won $1.25 billion in a court settlement in 2010. A separate $760 million in compensation for American Indian farmers was also announced.\nZIP CODE LOTTERY\nBringing to mind scorched, barren terrain far from towns and cities, the USDA uses the term \u201cfood desert\u201d to describe areas with limited supplies of fresh, affordable foods.\nIt is a term rejected by community farming activists who say the lack of food available in these poverty-afflicted areas is a reflection of discrimination rather than unfavourable geography.\nAn estimated 54.4 million Americans - 17.7% of the population - live in \u201cfood deserts\u201d, according to the USDA.\nNot everyone living in \u201cfood deserts\u201d is Black, but studies have shown that even when poverty levels are similar, Black neighborhoods have fewer supermarkets than other areas.\nPenniman, who opened Soul Fire Farm in 2010, lived in a \u201cfood desert\u201d in the south of Albany, New York, recalling how hard it was to find fruit and vegetables for her young family as they did not own a car and there was no bus service.\nThe only option was to buy a subscription from a local farm about two miles (three kms) away through a community-supported agriculture (CSA) program. It cost more than the family\u2019s rent.\nThat spurred Penniman and her husband to set up a community garden that now offers low-cost doorstep delivery of fruits and vegetables to residents of the Albany-Troy area and runs training programs on how to farm.\n\u201cIn this country, your zip code is a very high predictor of your life expectancy,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a concentration of hunger and diet-related illness in certain zip codes that correlates with where Black and brown communities live.\u201d\nOther grassroots initiatives challenging the agricultural status quo are happening in other parts of the country, even as the pandemic forces the suspension of services such as farmers markets and on-site training courses.\nIn Chicago, Allen\u2019s Urban Growers Collective, which uses converted city buses as mobile markets for farm produce, plans to start work on a facility to turn food waste into compost.\nCritically acclaimed Burmese restaurant Thamee in Washington D.C. has teamed up with non-profit Dreaming Out Loud to offer customers a selection of products sourced from Black farmers.\nThe restaurant is also selling pantry items produced by Black, Indigenous and people of color, said co-owner Simone Jacobson.\nWashington hopes that changes stemming from the coronavirus and Black Lives Matter movement could prove a watershed in her fight to uproot \u201cfood apartheid\u201d for good.\nBut she said structural changes were needed as opposed to businesses paying lip service to equality by making one-off donations to charity programmes or other PR-friendly gestures.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t go on controlling a food system and say systemic change is going to take place ... Move on and let somebody else take the leadership position,\u201d she said.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t always say, \u2018I\u2019m waiting for you to get ready.\u2019 We\u2019ve been ready for 400 years.\u201d\nReporting by Thin Lei Win, Editing by Helen Popper and Belinda Goldsmith Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers the lives of people around the world who struggle to live freely or fairly.

About four in 10, most of them Democrats, say Republican Trump is just trying to help himself politically as he seeks a second term in the Nov. 3 election.\nThe poll follows a series of late-night clashes between protesters and federal police in Portland, Oregon, where demonstrators have held nightly anti-racism rallies. Trump sent federal police into the city despite the mayor\u2019s objections to deal with what he called \u201canarchists and agitators,\u201d and he has sent others to Seattle, Chicago, Kansas City and Albuquerque.\nAccording to the poll, 52% of American adults say they are sympathetic to those who are still gathering to protest the police treatment of minorities, especially African Americans, about 12 percentage points lower than a similar poll that ran in mid-June.\nBut a majority of Americans remain unhappy with the way he has responded. The poll showed 54% of Americans disapprove of Trump\u2019s handling of the protests, which is only a slight improvement from a similar poll that ran in mid-June when 58% disapproved.\nThe rise in support comes primarily from Republicans who have backed the president in greater numbers as the protests rage across the country: 78% said they approved of Trump\u2019s response to the demonstrations in the latest poll, up from 67% in mid-June. Nearly nine out of 10 Democrats say they do not like the way Trump is dealing with the protests, and that has not changed over since June.\nPOLITICAL AGENDA OR LAW AND ORDER?\nAnd 42% of Americans appeared to be suspicious of Trump\u2019s motives related to his decision to send federal police into cities, saying that those agents were being deployed mostly \u201cto further Trump\u2019s political agenda.\u201d Another 39% said the agents are \u201crestoring law and order in major U.S. cities,\u201d and the remaining 19% said they were not sure.\nThe response was similarly split in the suburbs, where Trump has been hoping to brand himself as a champion of public safety. Some 44% of suburban Americans said they thought the federal agents were being used for political purposes while 37% thought they were mostly there to restore law and order.\nAs with almost everything related to Trump, American public opinion was divided along party lines. Nationally, 73% of Democrats felt that Trump was playing politics when he ordered federal police into Portland, while 76% of Republicans said those agents are mostly there to restore law and order.\nTrump\u2019s overall popularity remains at the lowest level it has been this year, with 38% of Americans saying they approve of the president\u2019s job performance. And Democratic candidate Joe Biden leads Trump by 9 percentage points among registered voters.\nThe Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online, in English, throughout the United States. It gathered responses from 1,115 American adults, including 947 registered voters, and has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of about 4 percentage points.\nClick here to see the full poll results: tmsnrt.rs/39zPHMw\nReporting by Chris Kahn, Editing by Soyoung Kim and Grant McCool\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"url": "/article/idUSKCN24U05A", "headline": "Federal agents pull out of Seattle, mayor says", "published_date": "2020-07-29", "text": "By Reuters Staff\n3 MIN READ\n(Reuters) - U.S. agents deployed to Seattle to protect federal property have left the city after local officials complained their presence was escalating tensions, Seattle\u2019s mayor said on Tuesday.\n ADVERTISEMENT: Your content will begin in 1 seconds\nU.S. tactical forces arrived in Washington state\u2019s largest city last week and were on standby to protect federal facilities after attacks on a federal courthouse in Portland, Oregon.\nMayor Jenny Durkan rejected the deployment, saying it did not have the consent of local officials and could incite the property damage it was supposed to prevent.\nShe tweeted on Tuesday that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) told her that U.S. Border Patrol Tactical Unit agents had left Seattle.

And for more than a year, the retailer used state-of-the-art facial recognition technology from a company with links to China and its authoritarian government.\nIn telephone and email exchanges with Reuters since February, Rite Aid confirmed the existence and breadth of its facial recognition program. The retailer defended the technology\u2019s use, saying it had nothing to do with race and was intended to deter theft and protect staff and customers from violence. Reuters found no evidence that Rite Aid\u2019s data was sent to China.\nLast week, however, after Reuters sent its findings to the retailer, Rite Aid said it had quit using its facial recognition software. It later said all the cameras had been turned off.\n\u201cThis decision was in part based on a larger industry conversation,\u201d the company told Reuters in a statement, adding that \u201cother large technology companies seem to be scaling back or rethinking their efforts around facial recognition given increasing uncertainty around the technology\u2019s utility.\u201d\nReuters pieced together how the company\u2019s initiative evolved, how the software has been used and how a recent vendor was linked to China, drawing on thousands of pages of internal documents from Rite Aid and its suppliers, as well as direct observations during store visits by Reuters journalists and interviews with more than 40 people familiar with the systems\u2019 deployment. Most current and former employees spoke on condition of anonymity, saying they feared jeopardizing their careers.\nWhile Rite Aid declined to disclose which locations used the technology, Reuters found facial recognition cameras at 33 of the 75 Rite Aid shops in Manhattan and the central Los Angeles metropolitan area during one or more visits from October through July.\nThe cameras were easily recognizable, hanging from the ceiling on poles near store entrances and in cosmetics aisles. Most were about half a foot long, rectangular and labeled either by their model, \u201ciHD23,\u201d or by a serial number including the vendor\u2019s initials, \u201cDC.\u201d In a few stores, security personnel \u2013 known as loss prevention or asset protection agents \u2013 showed Reuters how they worked.\nThe cameras matched facial images of customers entering a store to those of people Rite Aid previously observed engaging in potential criminal activity, causing an alert to be sent to security agents\u2019 smartphones. Agents then reviewed the match for accuracy and could tell the customer to leave.\nRite Aid told Reuters in a February statement that customers had been apprised of the technology through \u201csignage\u201d at the shops, as well as in a written policy posted this year on its website. Reporters found no notice of the surveillance in more than a third of the stores they visited with the facial recognition cameras.\nAmong the 75 stores Reuters visited, those in areas that were poorer or less white were much more likely to have the equipment, the news agency\u2019s statistical analysis found.\nStores in more impoverished areas were nearly three times as likely as those in richer areas to have facial recognition cameras. Seventeen of 25 stores in poorer areas had the systems. In wealthier areas, it was 10 of 40. (Ten of the stores were in areas whose wealth status was not clear. Six of those stores had the equipment.)\nIn areas where people of color, including Black or Latino residents, made up the largest racial or ethnic group, Reuters found that stores were more than three times as likely to have the technology.\nReuters\u2019 findings illustrate \u201cthe dire need for a national conversation about privacy, consumer education, transparency, and the need to safeguard the Constitutional rights of Americans,\u201d said Carolyn Maloney, the Democratic chairwoman of the House oversight committee, which has held hearings on the use of facial recognition technology.\nRite Aid said the rollout was \u201cdata-driven,\u201d based on stores\u2019 theft histories, local and national crime data and site infrastructure.\nCathy Langley, Rite Aid\u2019s vice president of asset protection, said earlier this year that facial recognition \u2013 which she referred to as \u201cfeature matching\u201d \u2013 resulted in less violence and organized crime in the company\u2019s stores. Last week, however, Rite Aid said its new leadership team was reviewing practices across the company, and \u201cthis was one of a number of programs that was terminated.\u201d\n\u2018ORWELLIAN SURVEILLANCE\u2019\nFacial recognition technology has become highly controversial in the United States as its use has expanded in both the public and private sectors, including by law enforcement and retailers. Civil liberties advocates warn it can lead to harassment of innocent individuals, arbitrary and discriminatory arrests, infringements of privacy rights and chilled personal expression.\nAdding to these concerns, recent research by a U.S. government institute showed that algorithms that underpin the technology erred more often here when subjects had darker skin tones.\nFacial recognition systems are largely unregulated in the United States, despite disclosure or consent requirements, or limits on government use, in several states, including California, Washington, Texas and Illinois. Some cities, including San Francisco, ban municipal officials from using them. In general, the technology makes photos and videos more readily searchable, allowing retailers almost instantaneous facial comparisons within and across stores.\nAmong the systems used by Rite Aid was one from DeepCam LLC, which worked with a firm in China whose largest outside investor is a Chinese government fund. Some security experts said any program with connections to China was troubling because it could open the door to aggressive surveillance in the United States more typical of an autocratic state.\nU.S. Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican and acting chair of the U.S. Senate\u2019s intelligence committee, told Reuters in a statement that the Rite Aid system\u2019s potential link to China was \u201coutrageous.\u201d \u201cThe Chinese Communist Party\u2019s buildup of its Orwellian surveillance state is alarming, and China\u2019s efforts to export its surveillance state to collect data in America would be an unacceptable, serious threat,\u201d he said.\nThe security specialists expressed concern that information gathered by a China-linked company could ultimately land in that government\u2019s hands, helping Beijing to refine its facial recognition technology globally and monitor people in ways that violate American standards of privacy.\n\u201cIf it goes back to China, there are no rules,\u201d said James Lewis, the Technology Policy Program director at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.\nAsked for comment, China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: \u201cThese are unfounded smears and rumors.\u201d\n\u2018A PROMISING NEW TOOL\u2019\nRite Aid, afflicted with financial losses in recent years, is not the only retailer to adopt or explore facial recognition technology.\nTwo years ago, the Loss Prevention Research Council, a coalition founded by retailers to test anti-crime techniques, called facial recognition \u201ca promising new tool\u201d worthy of evaluation.\n\u201cThere are a handful of retailers that have made the decision, \u2018Look, we need to leverage tech to sell more and lose less,\u201d said council director Read Hayes. Rite Aid\u2019s program was one of the largest, if not the largest, in retail, Hayes said. The Camp Hill, Pennsylvania-based company operates about 2,400 stores around the country.\nRELATED COVERAGE\nHow Reuters analyzed Rite Aid's use of facial recognition technology\nThe Home Depot Inc HD.N said it had been testing facial recognition to reduce shoplifting in at least one of its stores but stopped the trial this year. A smaller rival, Menards, piloted systems in at least 10 locations as of early 2019, a person familiar with that effort said.\nWalmart Inc WMT.N has also tried out facial recognition in a handful of stores, said two sources with knowledge of the tests. Walmart and Menards had no comment.\nUsing facial recognition to approach people who previously have committed \u201cdishonest acts\u201d in a store before they do so again is less dangerous for staff, said Rite Aid\u2019s former vice president of asset protection, Bob Oberosler, who made the decision to deploy an early facial recognition system at Rite Aid. That way, \u201cthere was significantly less need for law enforcement involvement,\u201d he said.\n\u2018TOUGHER\u2019 NEIGHBORHOODS\nIn interviews, 10 current and former Rite Aid loss prevention agents told Reuters that the system they initially used in stores was from a company called FaceFirst, which has been backed by U.S. investment firms.\nIt regularly misidentified people, all 10 of them said.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t pick up Black people well,\u201d one loss prevention staffer said last year while using FaceFirst at a Rite Aid in an African-American neighborhood of Detroit. \u201cIf your eyes are the same way, or if you\u2019re wearing your headband like another person is wearing a headband, you\u2019re going to get a hit.\u201d\nFaceFirst\u2019s chief executive, Peter Trepp, said facial recognition generally works well irrespective of skin tone, an issue he said the industry addressed years ago. He declined to talk about Rite Aid, saying he would not discuss any possible clients.\nRite Aid originally piloted FaceFirst at its store on West 3rd Street and South Vermont Avenue in Los Angeles, a largely Asian and Latino neighborhood, around 2012.\nOf the 65 stores the retailer targeted in its first big rollout, 52 were in areas where the largest group was Black or Latino, according to Reuters\u2019 analysis of a Rite Aid planning document from 2013 that was read aloud to a reporter by someone with access to it. Reuters confirmed that some of these stores later deployed the technology but did not confirm its presence at every location on the list.\nSeparately, two former Rite Aid managers and a third source familiar with the FaceFirst rollout said the systems were concentrated, respectively, in the \u201ctougher,\u201d \u201ctoughest\u201d or \u201cworst\u201d areas.\nReuters reviewed a 2016 spreadsheet from the company\u2019s asset protection unit in which Rite Aid rated 20 higher-earning Manhattan stores as having equal risk of loss \u2013 labeled \u201cMedHigh.\u201d Two of 10 stores where whites were the largest racial group had facial recognition technology when Reuters visited this year, whereas eight of the 10 in non-white areas had the systems.\nOne spot ranked \u201cMedHigh\u201d was a store at 741 Columbus Avenue in New York\u2019s whiter, wealthier Upper West Side. Another was the pharmacy\u2019s West 125th Street store in nearby Harlem, a majority African-American neighborhood. The Harlem store got facial recognition technology; the Upper West Side one did not, as of July 9.\n(See graphics here here and here here and here tmsnrt.rs/2EpMRhF?scatter=true)\n\u2018LOOKS NOTHING LIKE ME\u2019\nStarting in 2013, as Rite Aid deployed FaceFirst\u2019s technology in Philadelphia, Baltimore and beyond, some serious drawbacks emerged, current and former security agents and managers told Reuters.\nFor instance, the system would \u201cgenerate 500 hits in an hour all across the United States\u201d when photos in the system were blurry or taken at an odd angle, one of the people familiar with FaceFirst\u2019s operations said.\nFaceFirst\u2019s Trepp said the company has high accuracy rates while running \u201cover 12 trillion comparisons per day without any known complaints to date.\u201d\nDuring that earlier period, Tristan Jackson-Stankunas said Rite Aid wrongly fingered him as a shoplifter in a Los Angeles store based on someone else\u2019s photo. While Reuters could not confirm the method Rite Aid used to identify him, the store had FaceFirst technology by that time, according to a Rite Aid security agent and a Foursquare review photo showing the camera.\nAccording to a complaint Jackson-Stankunas filed with the California Department of Consumer Affairs a week after the incident, he was looking for air freshener in September 2016 when a manager ordered him to leave the store. The manager said he had received a security image of Jackson-Stankunas taken at another Rite Aid in 2013 from which he allegedly had stolen goods, according to the complaint.\nWhen Jackson-Stankunas viewed the photo on the manager\u2019s phone, he told Reuters, he saw nothing in common with the person except their race: Both are Black.\n\u201cThe guy looks nothing like me,\u201d said Jackson-Stankunas, 34, who ultimately was allowed to make his purchase and leave the store. Rite Aid \u201conly identified me because I was a person of color. That\u2019s it.\u201d\nThe California department told him his complaint fell outside its purview, directing him to another state office, email records show. Instead, he said he decided to write the store a bad review on Yelp.\nRite Aid and the manager who allegedly was involved declined to comment on Jackson-Stankunas\u2019 account.\nAt one store Reuters visited, a security agent scrolled through FaceFirst \u201calerts\u201d showing a number of cases in which faces were obviously mismatched, including a Black man mixed up with someone who was Asian. Reuters could not determine whether the incorrect matches resulted in confrontations with customers.\nFaceFirst CEO Trepp said that his company takes racial bias seriously and would not work with any business that disregarded civil rights. \u201cWe cannot stand for racial injustice of any kind, including in our technology,\u201d he said.\nGenerally, Trepp said, Reuters\u2019 findings about his company contained \u201cextensive factual inaccuracies\u201d and are \u201cnot based upon information from credible sources.\u201d\nSlideshow ( 8 images )\nA NEW SYSTEM\nEarly in 2018, Rite Aid began installing technology from DeepCam LLC, ultimately phasing out FaceFirst in stores around the country, interviews with Rite Aid loss prevention agents and internal vendor documents indicate.\nSix security staffers who used both systems said DeepCam\u2019s matches were more accurate \u2013 sometimes to a fault. The technology picked up faces from ads on buses or pictures on T-shirts, three said. One famous face captured in DeepCam was Marilyn Monroe\u2019s, one of the agents said.\nAt least until 2017, FaceFirst had employed an older method of biometric identification that compared maps of subjects\u2019 faces, two people familiar with its system said. Only later did it move over to software based on \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d like DeepCam\u2019s. Though the data and algorithms differ by brand, these systems draw upon potentially millions of samples to \u201clearn\u201d how to match faces.\nDeepCam cameras photographed and took live video of every person entering a Rite Aid store, aiming to create a unique facial profile, Rite Aid agents said. If the customer walked in front of another DeepCam facial recognition camera at a Rite Aid shop, new images were added to the person\u2019s existing profile. Two agents said they lost access to the images after 10 days unless the person landed on a watch list based on their behavior in stores.\nWhen agents saw someone commit a crime \u2013 or just do something suspicious, one said \u2013 they scrolled through profiles on their smartphone to search for the individual, only adding the person to the watch list with a manager\u2019s approval. The next time the shopper walked into a Rite Aid that had the technology, agents received a phone alert and checked the match for accuracy. Then they could order the person to leave, agents told Reuters.\nRite Aid said adding customers to the watch list was based on \u201cmultiple layers of meaningful human review.\u201d The company told Reuters its procedures ensured customers were not confronted unnecessarily.\nIf a person was found to be engaging in criminal behavior, Rite Aid said, \u201cwe retain the data as a matter of policy to cooperate in pending or potential criminal investigations.\u201d\nOther U.S. retail stores have tried DeepCam. Independent 7-Eleven franchise owners in Virginia told Reuters they conducted trials of the software starting in 2018 and later dropped it. They said they largely found the system accurate but not user friendly and too expensive to maintain. The system was advertised online as costing $99 a month.\n7-Eleven Inc did not answer requests for comment.\nTHE CHINA CONNECTION\nThe two founding owners of U.S.-based DeepCam LLC were Don Knasel and Jingfeng Liu, who set up the firm in Longmont, Colorado, in 2017, state records show. Liu\u2019s residential address in Longmont was listed as its headquarters.\nA Chinese native with U.S. citizenship and a doctorate from Carnegie Mellon University, Liu had the skills to do business in both the United States and China.\nAccording to China\u2019s official business registration records, he is chairman of another facial recognition firm in China called Shenzhen Shenmu Information Technology Co Ltd, whose website is DeepCam.com.\nFor a time, the U.S.-based DeepCam LLC and Shenzhen Shenmu were closely connected: In addition to Liu\u2019s role in both companies, they shared the same website and email accounts, according to internal records seen by Reuters.\nSlideshow ( 8 images )\nInternal correspondence reviewed by Reuters suggests that DeepCam reached a deal with Rite Aid by March 2018, when a colleague emailed Knasel to congratulate him. Internal records also indicated that China-based Shenzhen Shenmu helped its American counterpart with product development and that Liu was expected to pay at least some of the bills.

And for more than a year, the retailer used state-of-the-art facial recognition technology from a company with links to China and its authoritarian government.\nIn telephone and email exchanges with Reuters since February, Rite Aid confirmed the existence and breadth of its facial recognition program. The retailer defended the technology\u2019s use, saying it had nothing to do with race and was intended to deter theft and protect staff and customers from violence. Reuters found no evidence that Rite Aid\u2019s data was sent to China.\nLast week, however, after Reuters sent its findings to the retailer, Rite Aid said it had quit using its facial recognition software. It later said all the cameras had been turned off.\n\u201cThis decision was in part based on a larger industry conversation,\u201d the company told Reuters in a statement, adding that \u201cother large technology companies seem to be scaling back or rethinking their efforts around facial recognition given increasing uncertainty around the technology\u2019s utility.\u201d\nReuters pieced together how the company\u2019s initiative evolved, how the software has been used and how a recent vendor was linked to China, drawing on thousands of pages of internal documents from Rite Aid and its suppliers, as well as direct observations during store visits by Reuters journalists and interviews with more than 40 people familiar with the systems\u2019 deployment. Most current and former employees spoke on condition of anonymity, saying they feared jeopardizing their careers.\nWhile Rite Aid declined to disclose which locations used the technology, Reuters found facial recognition cameras at 33 of the 75 Rite Aid shops in Manhattan and the central Los Angeles metropolitan area during one or more visits from October through July.\nThe cameras were easily recognizable, hanging from the ceiling on poles near store entrances and in cosmetics aisles. Most were about half a foot long, rectangular and labeled either by their model, \u201ciHD23,\u201d or by a serial number including the vendor\u2019s initials, \u201cDC.\u201d In a few stores, security personnel \u2013 known as loss prevention or asset protection agents \u2013 showed Reuters how they worked.\nThe cameras matched facial images of customers entering a store to those of people Rite Aid previously observed engaging in potential criminal activity, causing an alert to be sent to security agents\u2019 smartphones. Agents then reviewed the match for accuracy and could tell the customer to leave.\nRite Aid told Reuters in a February statement that customers had been apprised of the technology through \u201csignage\u201d at the shops, as well as in a written policy posted this year on its website. Reporters found no notice of the surveillance in more than a third of the stores they visited with the facial recognition cameras.\nAmong the 75 stores Reuters visited, those in areas that were poorer or less white were much more likely to have the equipment, the news agency\u2019s statistical analysis found.\nStores in more impoverished areas were nearly three times as likely as those in richer areas to have facial recognition cameras. Seventeen of 25 stores in poorer areas had the systems. In wealthier areas, it was 10 of 40. (Ten of the stores were in areas whose wealth status was not clear. Six of those stores had the equipment.)\nIn areas where people of color, including Black or Latino residents, made up the largest racial or ethnic group, Reuters found that stores were more than three times as likely to have the technology.\nReuters\u2019 findings illustrate \u201cthe dire need for a national conversation about privacy, consumer education, transparency, and the need to safeguard the Constitutional rights of Americans,\u201d said Carolyn Maloney, the Democratic chairwoman of the House oversight committee, which has held hearings on the use of facial recognition technology.\nRite Aid said the rollout was \u201cdata-driven,\u201d based on stores\u2019 theft histories, local and national crime data and site infrastructure.\nCathy Langley, Rite Aid\u2019s vice president of asset protection, said earlier this year that facial recognition \u2013 which she referred to as \u201cfeature matching\u201d \u2013 resulted in less violence and organized crime in the company\u2019s stores. Last week, however, Rite Aid said its new leadership team was reviewing practices across the company, and \u201cthis was one of a number of programs that was terminated.\u201d\n\u2018ORWELLIAN SURVEILLANCE\u2019\nFacial recognition technology has become highly controversial in the United States as its use has expanded in both the public and private sectors, including by law enforcement and retailers. Civil liberties advocates warn it can lead to harassment of innocent individuals, arbitrary and discriminatory arrests, infringements of privacy rights and chilled personal expression.\nAdding to these concerns, recent research by a U.S. government institute showed that algorithms that underpin the technology erred more often here when subjects had darker skin tones.\nFacial recognition systems are largely unregulated in the United States, despite disclosure or consent requirements, or limits on government use, in several states, including California, Washington, Texas and Illinois. Some cities, including San Francisco, ban municipal officials from using them. In general, the technology makes photos and videos more readily searchable, allowing retailers almost instantaneous facial comparisons within and across stores.\nAmong the systems used by Rite Aid was one from DeepCam LLC, which worked with a firm in China whose largest outside investor is a Chinese government fund. Some security experts said any program with connections to China was troubling because it could open the door to aggressive surveillance in the United States more typical of an autocratic state.\nU.S. Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican and acting chair of the U.S. Senate\u2019s intelligence committee, told Reuters in a statement that the Rite Aid system\u2019s potential link to China was \u201coutrageous.\u201d \u201cThe Chinese Communist Party\u2019s buildup of its Orwellian surveillance state is alarming, and China\u2019s efforts to export its surveillance state to collect data in America would be an unacceptable, serious threat,\u201d he said.\nThe security specialists expressed concern that information gathered by a China-linked company could ultimately land in that government\u2019s hands, helping Beijing to refine its facial recognition technology globally and monitor people in ways that violate American standards of privacy.\n\u201cIf it goes back to China, there are no rules,\u201d said James Lewis, the Technology Policy Program director at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.\nAsked for comment, China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: \u201cThese are unfounded smears and rumors.\u201d\n\u2018A PROMISING NEW TOOL\u2019\nRite Aid, afflicted with financial losses in recent years, is not the only retailer to adopt or explore facial recognition technology.\nTwo years ago, the Loss Prevention Research Council, a coalition founded by retailers to test anti-crime techniques, called facial recognition \u201ca promising new tool\u201d worthy of evaluation.\n\u201cThere are a handful of retailers that have made the decision, \u2018Look, we need to leverage tech to sell more and lose less,\u201d said council director Read Hayes. Rite Aid\u2019s program was one of the largest, if not the largest, in retail, Hayes said. The Camp Hill, Pennsylvania-based company operates about 2,400 stores around the country.\nRELATED COVERAGE\nHow Reuters analyzed Rite Aid's use of facial recognition technology\nThe Home Depot Inc HD.N said it had been testing facial recognition to reduce shoplifting in at least one of its stores but stopped the trial this year. A smaller rival, Menards, piloted systems in at least 10 locations as of early 2019, a person familiar with that effort said.\nWalmart Inc WMT.N has also tried out facial recognition in a handful of stores, said two sources with knowledge of the tests. Walmart and Menards had no comment.\nUsing facial recognition to approach people who previously have committed \u201cdishonest acts\u201d in a store before they do so again is less dangerous for staff, said Rite Aid\u2019s former vice president of asset protection, Bob Oberosler, who made the decision to deploy an early facial recognition system at Rite Aid. That way, \u201cthere was significantly less need for law enforcement involvement,\u201d he said.\n\u2018TOUGHER\u2019 NEIGHBORHOODS\nIn interviews, 10 current and former Rite Aid loss prevention agents told Reuters that the system they initially used in stores was from a company called FaceFirst, which has been backed by U.S. investment firms.\nIt regularly misidentified people, all 10 of them said.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t pick up Black people well,\u201d one loss prevention staffer said last year while using FaceFirst at a Rite Aid in an African-American neighborhood of Detroit. \u201cIf your eyes are the same way, or if you\u2019re wearing your headband like another person is wearing a headband, you\u2019re going to get a hit.\u201d\nFaceFirst\u2019s chief executive, Peter Trepp, said facial recognition generally works well irrespective of skin tone, an issue he said the industry addressed years ago. He declined to talk about Rite Aid, saying he would not discuss any possible clients.\nRite Aid originally piloted FaceFirst at its store on West 3rd Street and South Vermont Avenue in Los Angeles, a largely Asian and Latino neighborhood, around 2012.\nOf the 65 stores the retailer targeted in its first big rollout, 52 were in areas where the largest group was Black or Latino, according to Reuters\u2019 analysis of a Rite Aid planning document from 2013 that was read aloud to a reporter by someone with access to it. Reuters confirmed that some of these stores later deployed the technology but did not confirm its presence at every location on the list.\nSeparately, two former Rite Aid managers and a third source familiar with the FaceFirst rollout said the systems were concentrated, respectively, in the \u201ctougher,\u201d \u201ctoughest\u201d or \u201cworst\u201d areas.\nReuters reviewed a 2016 spreadsheet from the company\u2019s asset protection unit in which Rite Aid rated 20 higher-earning Manhattan stores as having equal risk of loss \u2013 labeled \u201cMedHigh.\u201d Two of 10 stores where whites were the largest racial group had facial recognition technology when Reuters visited this year, whereas eight of the 10 in non-white areas had the systems.\nOne spot ranked \u201cMedHigh\u201d was a store at 741 Columbus Avenue in New York\u2019s whiter, wealthier Upper West Side. Another was the pharmacy\u2019s West 125th Street store in nearby Harlem, a majority African-American neighborhood. The Harlem store got facial recognition technology; the Upper West Side one did not, as of July 9.\n(See graphics here here and here here and here tmsnrt.rs/2EpMRhF?scatter=true)\n\u2018LOOKS NOTHING LIKE ME\u2019\nStarting in 2013, as Rite Aid deployed FaceFirst\u2019s technology in Philadelphia, Baltimore and beyond, some serious drawbacks emerged, current and former security agents and managers told Reuters.\nFor instance, the system would \u201cgenerate 500 hits in an hour all across the United States\u201d when photos in the system were blurry or taken at an odd angle, one of the people familiar with FaceFirst\u2019s operations said.\nFaceFirst\u2019s Trepp said the company has high accuracy rates while running \u201cover 12 trillion comparisons per day without any known complaints to date.\u201d\nDuring that earlier period, Tristan Jackson-Stankunas said Rite Aid wrongly fingered him as a shoplifter in a Los Angeles store based on someone else\u2019s photo. While Reuters could not confirm the method Rite Aid used to identify him, the store had FaceFirst technology by that time, according to a Rite Aid security agent and a Foursquare review photo showing the camera.\nAccording to a complaint Jackson-Stankunas filed with the California Department of Consumer Affairs a week after the incident, he was looking for air freshener in September 2016 when a manager ordered him to leave the store. The manager said he had received a security image of Jackson-Stankunas taken at another Rite Aid in 2013 from which he allegedly had stolen goods, according to the complaint.\nWhen Jackson-Stankunas viewed the photo on the manager\u2019s phone, he told Reuters, he saw nothing in common with the person except their race: Both are Black.\n\u201cThe guy looks nothing like me,\u201d said Jackson-Stankunas, 34, who ultimately was allowed to make his purchase and leave the store. Rite Aid \u201conly identified me because I was a person of color. That\u2019s it.\u201d\nThe California department told him his complaint fell outside its purview, directing him to another state office, email records show. Instead, he said he decided to write the store a bad review on Yelp.\nRite Aid and the manager who allegedly was involved declined to comment on Jackson-Stankunas\u2019 account.\nAt one store Reuters visited, a security agent scrolled through FaceFirst \u201calerts\u201d showing a number of cases in which faces were obviously mismatched, including a Black man mixed up with someone who was Asian. Reuters could not determine whether the incorrect matches resulted in confrontations with customers.\nFaceFirst CEO Trepp said that his company takes racial bias seriously and would not work with any business that disregarded civil rights. \u201cWe cannot stand for racial injustice of any kind, including in our technology,\u201d he said.\nGenerally, Trepp said, Reuters\u2019 findings about his company contained \u201cextensive factual inaccuracies\u201d and are \u201cnot based upon information from credible sources.\u201d\nSlideshow ( 8 images )\nA NEW SYSTEM\nEarly in 2018, Rite Aid began installing technology from DeepCam LLC, ultimately phasing out FaceFirst in stores around the country, interviews with Rite Aid loss prevention agents and internal vendor documents indicate.\nSix security staffers who used both systems said DeepCam\u2019s matches were more accurate \u2013 sometimes to a fault. The technology picked up faces from ads on buses or pictures on T-shirts, three said. One famous face captured in DeepCam was Marilyn Monroe\u2019s, one of the agents said.\nAt least until 2017, FaceFirst had employed an older method of biometric identification that compared maps of subjects\u2019 faces, two people familiar with its system said. Only later did it move over to software based on \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d like DeepCam\u2019s. Though the data and algorithms differ by brand, these systems draw upon potentially millions of samples to \u201clearn\u201d how to match faces.\nDeepCam cameras photographed and took live video of every person entering a Rite Aid store, aiming to create a unique facial profile, Rite Aid agents said. If the customer walked in front of another DeepCam facial recognition camera at a Rite Aid shop, new images were added to the person\u2019s existing profile. Two agents said they lost access to the images after 10 days unless the person landed on a watch list based on their behavior in stores.\nWhen agents saw someone commit a crime \u2013 or just do something suspicious, one said \u2013 they scrolled through profiles on their smartphone to search for the individual, only adding the person to the watch list with a manager\u2019s approval. The next time the shopper walked into a Rite Aid that had the technology, agents received a phone alert and checked the match for accuracy. Then they could order the person to leave, agents told Reuters.\nRite Aid said adding customers to the watch list was based on \u201cmultiple layers of meaningful human review.\u201d The company told Reuters its procedures ensured customers were not confronted unnecessarily.\nIf a person was found to be engaging in criminal behavior, Rite Aid said, \u201cwe retain the data as a matter of policy to cooperate in pending or potential criminal investigations.\u201d\nOther U.S. retail stores have tried DeepCam. Independent 7-Eleven franchise owners in Virginia told Reuters they conducted trials of the software starting in 2018 and later dropped it. They said they largely found the system accurate but not user friendly and too expensive to maintain. The system was advertised online as costing $99 a month.\n7-Eleven Inc did not answer requests for comment.\nTHE CHINA CONNECTION\nThe two founding owners of U.S.-based DeepCam LLC were Don Knasel and Jingfeng Liu, who set up the firm in Longmont, Colorado, in 2017, state records show. Liu\u2019s residential address in Longmont was listed as its headquarters.\nA Chinese native with U.S. citizenship and a doctorate from Carnegie Mellon University, Liu had the skills to do business in both the United States and China.\nAccording to China\u2019s official business registration records, he is chairman of another facial recognition firm in China called Shenzhen Shenmu Information Technology Co Ltd, whose website is DeepCam.com.\nFor a time, the U.S.-based DeepCam LLC and Shenzhen Shenmu were closely connected: In addition to Liu\u2019s role in both companies, they shared the same website and email accounts, according to internal records seen by Reuters.\nSlideshow ( 8 images )\nInternal correspondence reviewed by Reuters suggests that DeepCam reached a deal with Rite Aid by March 2018, when a colleague emailed Knasel to congratulate him. Internal records also indicated that China-based Shenzhen Shenmu helped its American counterpart with product development and that Liu was expected to pay at least some of the bills. That same month, a U.S. executive wrote: \u201cHi Jingfeng- Thanks for the credit card. Here is the receipt for the Indianapolis Trade Show.\u201d\nIn an interview, Liu confirmed the financing, saying of Knasel: \u201cWhenever he needed money, I give him some money.\u201d Liu said Knasel told him about the Rite Aid project but left him in the dark about the business. Knasel \u201cnever let data cross between the two countries,\u201d Liu said.\nAs the Rite Aid rollout proceeded in 2018, correspondence among DeepCam staff, seen by Reuters, expressed concerns about publicly revealing any links to China, as well as using the term \u201cfacial recognition\u201d in the U.S. market for fear of attracting the attention of the American Civil Liberties Union.\nDays after the ACLU wrote a March 2018 blog post here critical of retailers\u2019 suspected use of the technology, including Rite Aid\u2019s, Knasel emailed staff: \u201cIt looks like the ACLU may be starting to stick its head up....We need to tone down facial recognition, which I have tried to do....If they come after us, we are dead....so we have to avoid.\u201d The punctuation in the message is Knasel\u2019s.\nJay Stanley, the ACLU senior policy analyst who co-authored the blog post, told Reuters that the right response to civil liberties concerns about surveillance technology \u201cis not to start using it in secret.\u201d\nIt is \u201cto stop using the technology altogether. We are glad Rite Aid seems to have ultimately recognized this.\u201d\nToday, both Liu and Knasel say no ties exist between the U.S. and Chinese businesses.\n\u201cWe never do any business in USA,\u201d Liu wrote in a brief email to Reuters in March. \u201cWe focus in China market.\u201d\nMore recently, in an interview and an email, Liu said he had not spoken with Knasel for more than a year and, to his disappointment, had not benefited from the U.S. venture.\nIn a statement to Reuters, Knasel sought to distance himself from Liu, Shenzhen Shenmu and DeepCam.\nHe did not address questions about DeepCam\u2019s deal with Rite Aid.

And for more than a year, the retailer used state-of-the-art facial recognition technology from a company with links to China and its authoritarian government.\nIn telephone and email exchanges with Reuters since February, Rite Aid confirmed the existence and breadth of its facial recognition program. The retailer defended the technology\u2019s use, saying it had nothing to do with race and was intended to deter theft and protect staff and customers from violence. Reuters found no evidence that Rite Aid\u2019s data was sent to China.\nLast week, however, after Reuters sent its findings to the retailer, Rite Aid said it had quit using its facial recognition software. It later said all the cameras had been turned off.\n\u201cThis decision was in part based on a larger industry conversation,\u201d the company told Reuters in a statement, adding that \u201cother large technology companies seem to be scaling back or rethinking their efforts around facial recognition given increasing uncertainty around the technology\u2019s utility.\u201d\nReuters pieced together how the company\u2019s initiative evolved, how the software has been used and how a recent vendor was linked to China, drawing on thousands of pages of internal documents from Rite Aid and its suppliers, as well as direct observations during store visits by Reuters journalists and interviews with more than 40 people familiar with the systems\u2019 deployment. Most current and former employees spoke on condition of anonymity, saying they feared jeopardizing their careers.\nWhile Rite Aid declined to disclose which locations used the technology, Reuters found facial recognition cameras at 33 of the 75 Rite Aid shops in Manhattan and the central Los Angeles metropolitan area during one or more visits from October through July.\nThe cameras were easily recognizable, hanging from the ceiling on poles near store entrances and in cosmetics aisles. Most were about half a foot long, rectangular and labeled either by their model, \u201ciHD23,\u201d or by a serial number including the vendor\u2019s initials, \u201cDC.\u201d In a few stores, security personnel \u2013 known as loss prevention or asset protection agents \u2013 showed Reuters how they worked.\nThe cameras matched facial images of customers entering a store to those of people Rite Aid previously observed engaging in potential criminal activity, causing an alert to be sent to security agents\u2019 smartphones. Agents then reviewed the match for accuracy and could tell the customer to leave.\nRite Aid told Reuters in a February statement that customers had been apprised of the technology through \u201csignage\u201d at the shops, as well as in a written policy posted this year on its website. Reporters found no notice of the surveillance in more than a third of the stores they visited with the facial recognition cameras.\nAmong the 75 stores Reuters visited, those in areas that were poorer or less white were much more likely to have the equipment, the news agency\u2019s statistical analysis found.\nStores in more impoverished areas were nearly three times as likely as those in richer areas to have facial recognition cameras. Seventeen of 25 stores in poorer areas had the systems. In wealthier areas, it was 10 of 40. (Ten of the stores were in areas whose wealth status was not clear. Six of those stores had the equipment.)\nIn areas where people of color, including Black or Latino residents, made up the largest racial or ethnic group, Reuters found that stores were more than three times as likely to have the technology.\nReuters\u2019 findings illustrate \u201cthe dire need for a national conversation about privacy, consumer education, transparency, and the need to safeguard the Constitutional rights of Americans,\u201d said Carolyn Maloney, the Democratic chairwoman of the House oversight committee, which has held hearings on the use of facial recognition technology.\nRite Aid said the rollout was \u201cdata-driven,\u201d based on stores\u2019 theft histories, local and national crime data and site infrastructure.\nCathy Langley, Rite Aid\u2019s vice president of asset protection, said earlier this year that facial recognition \u2013 which she referred to as \u201cfeature matching\u201d \u2013 resulted in less violence and organized crime in the company\u2019s stores. Last week, however, Rite Aid said its new leadership team was reviewing practices across the company, and \u201cthis was one of a number of programs that was terminated.\u201d\n\u2018ORWELLIAN SURVEILLANCE\u2019\nFacial recognition technology has become highly controversial in the United States as its use has expanded in both the public and private sectors, including by law enforcement and retailers. Civil liberties advocates warn it can lead to harassment of innocent individuals, arbitrary and discriminatory arrests, infringements of privacy rights and chilled personal expression.\nAdding to these concerns, recent research by a U.S. government institute showed that algorithms that underpin the technology erred more often here when subjects had darker skin tones.\nFacial recognition systems are largely unregulated in the United States, despite disclosure or consent requirements, or limits on government use, in several states, including California, Washington, Texas and Illinois. Some cities, including San Francisco, ban municipal officials from using them. In general, the technology makes photos and videos more readily searchable, allowing retailers almost instantaneous facial comparisons within and across stores.\nAmong the systems used by Rite Aid was one from DeepCam LLC, which worked with a firm in China whose largest outside investor is a Chinese government fund. Some security experts said any program with connections to China was troubling because it could open the door to aggressive surveillance in the United States more typical of an autocratic state.\nU.S. Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican and acting chair of the U.S. Senate\u2019s intelligence committee, told Reuters in a statement that the Rite Aid system\u2019s potential link to China was \u201coutrageous.\u201d \u201cThe Chinese Communist Party\u2019s buildup of its Orwellian surveillance state is alarming, and China\u2019s efforts to export its surveillance state to collect data in America would be an unacceptable, serious threat,\u201d he said.\nThe security specialists expressed concern that information gathered by a China-linked company could ultimately land in that government\u2019s hands, helping Beijing to refine its facial recognition technology globally and monitor people in ways that violate American standards of privacy.\n\u201cIf it goes back to China, there are no rules,\u201d said James Lewis, the Technology Policy Program director at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.\nAsked for comment, China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: \u201cThese are unfounded smears and rumors.\u201d\n\u2018A PROMISING NEW TOOL\u2019\nRite Aid, afflicted with financial losses in recent years, is not the only retailer to adopt or explore facial recognition technology.\nTwo years ago, the Loss Prevention Research Council, a coalition founded by retailers to test anti-crime techniques, called facial recognition \u201ca promising new tool\u201d worthy of evaluation.\n\u201cThere are a handful of retailers that have made the decision, \u2018Look, we need to leverage tech to sell more and lose less,\u201d said council director Read Hayes. Rite Aid\u2019s program was one of the largest, if not the largest, in retail, Hayes said. The Camp Hill, Pennsylvania-based company operates about 2,400 stores around the country.\nThe Home Depot Inc said it had been testing facial recognition to reduce shoplifting in at least one of its stores but stopped the trial this year. A smaller rival, Menards, piloted systems in at least 10 locations as of early 2019, a person familiar with that effort said.\nWalmart Inc has also tried out facial recognition in a handful of stores, said two sources with knowledge of the tests. Walmart and Menards had no comment.\nUsing facial recognition to approach people who previously have committed \u201cdishonest acts\u201d in a store before they do so again is less dangerous for staff, said Rite Aid\u2019s former vice president of asset protection, Bob Oberosler, who made the decision to deploy an early facial recognition system at Rite Aid. That way, \u201cthere was significantly less need for law enforcement involvement,\u201d he said.\n\u2018TOUGHER\u2019 NEIGHBORHOODS\nIn interviews, 10 current and former Rite Aid loss prevention agents told Reuters that the system they initially used in stores was from a company called FaceFirst, which has been backed by U.S. investment firms.\nIt regularly misidentified people, all 10 of them said.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t pick up Black people well,\u201d one loss prevention staffer said last year while using FaceFirst at a Rite Aid in an African-American neighborhood of Detroit. \u201cIf your eyes are the same way, or if you\u2019re wearing your headband like another person is wearing a headband, you\u2019re going to get a hit.\u201d\nFaceFirst\u2019s chief executive, Peter Trepp, said facial recognition generally works well irrespective of skin tone, an issue he said the industry addressed years ago. He declined to talk about Rite Aid, saying he would not discuss any possible clients.\nRite Aid originally piloted FaceFirst at its store on West 3rd Street and South Vermont Avenue in Los Angeles, a largely Asian and Latino neighborhood, around 2012.\nOf the 65 stores the retailer targeted in its first big rollout, 52 were in areas where the largest group was Black or Latino, according to Reuters\u2019 analysis of a Rite Aid planning document from 2013 that was read aloud to a reporter by someone with access to it. Reuters confirmed that some of these stores later deployed the technology but did not confirm its presence at every location on the list.\nSeparately, two former Rite Aid managers and a third source familiar with the FaceFirst rollout said the systems were concentrated, respectively, in the \u201ctougher,\u201d \u201ctoughest\u201d or \u201cworst\u201d areas.\nReuters reviewed a 2016 spreadsheet from the company\u2019s asset protection unit in which Rite Aid rated 20 higher-earning Manhattan stores as having equal risk of loss \u2013 labeled \u201cMedHigh.\u201d Two of 10 stores where whites were the largest racial group had facial recognition technology when Reuters visited this year, whereas eight of the 10 in non-white areas had the systems.\nOne spot ranked \u201cMedHigh\u201d was a store at 741 Columbus Avenue in New York\u2019s whiter, wealthier Upper West Side. Another was the pharmacy\u2019s West 125th Street store in nearby Harlem, a majority African-American neighborhood. The Harlem store got facial recognition technology; the Upper West Side one did not, as of July 9.\n(See graphics here here and here here and here tmsnrt.rs/2EpMRhF?scatter=true)\n\u2018LOOKS NOTHING LIKE ME\u2019\nStarting in 2013, as Rite Aid deployed FaceFirst\u2019s technology in Philadelphia, Baltimore and beyond, some serious drawbacks emerged, current and former security agents and managers told Reuters.\nFor instance, the system would \u201cgenerate 500 hits in an hour all across the United States\u201d when photos in the system were blurry or taken at an odd angle, one of the people familiar with FaceFirst\u2019s operations said.\nFaceFirst\u2019s Trepp said the company has high accuracy rates while running \u201cover 12 trillion comparisons per day without any known complaints to date.\u201d\nDuring that earlier period, Tristan Jackson-Stankunas said Rite Aid wrongly fingered him as a shoplifter in a Los Angeles store based on someone else\u2019s photo. While Reuters could not confirm the method Rite Aid used to identify him, the store had FaceFirst technology by that time, according to a Rite Aid security agent and a Foursquare review photo showing the camera.\nAccording to a complaint Jackson-Stankunas filed with the California Department of Consumer Affairs a week after the incident, he was looking for air freshener in September 2016 when a manager ordered him to leave the store. The manager said he had received a security image of Jackson-Stankunas taken at another Rite Aid in 2013 from which he allegedly had stolen goods, according to the complaint.\nWhen Jackson-Stankunas viewed the photo on the manager\u2019s phone, he told Reuters, he saw nothing in common with the person except their race: Both are Black.\n\u201cThe guy looks nothing like me,\u201d said Jackson-Stankunas, 34, who ultimately was allowed to make his purchase and leave the store. Rite Aid \u201conly identified me because I was a person of color. That\u2019s it.\u201d\nThe California department told him his complaint fell outside its purview, directing him to another state office, email records show. Instead, he said he decided to write the store a bad review on Yelp.\nRite Aid and the manager who allegedly was involved declined to comment on Jackson-Stankunas\u2019 account.\nAt one store Reuters visited, a security agent scrolled through FaceFirst \u201calerts\u201d showing a number of cases in which faces were obviously mismatched, including a Black man mixed up with someone who was Asian. Reuters could not determine whether the incorrect matches resulted in confrontations with customers.\nFaceFirst CEO Trepp said that his company takes racial bias seriously and would not work with any business that disregarded civil rights. \u201cWe cannot stand for racial injustice of any kind, including in our technology,\u201d he said.\nGenerally, Trepp said, Reuters\u2019 findings about his company contained \u201cextensive factual inaccuracies\u201d and are \u201cnot based upon information from credible sources.\u201d\nA NEW SYSTEM\nEarly in 2018, Rite Aid began installing technology from DeepCam LLC, ultimately phasing out FaceFirst in stores around the country, interviews with Rite Aid loss prevention agents and internal vendor documents indicate.\nSix security staffers who used both systems said DeepCam\u2019s matches were more accurate \u2013 sometimes to a fault. The technology picked up faces from ads on buses or pictures on T-shirts, three said. One famous face captured in DeepCam was Marilyn Monroe\u2019s, one of the agents said.\nAt least until 2017, FaceFirst had employed an older method of biometric identification that compared maps of subjects\u2019 faces, two people familiar with its system said. Only later did it move over to software based on \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d like DeepCam\u2019s. Though the data and algorithms differ by brand, these systems draw upon potentially millions of samples to \u201clearn\u201d how to match faces.\nDeepCam cameras photographed and took live video of every person entering a Rite Aid store, aiming to create a unique facial profile, Rite Aid agents said. If the customer walked in front of another DeepCam facial recognition camera at a Rite Aid shop, new images were added to the person\u2019s existing profile. Two agents said they lost access to the images after 10 days unless the person landed on a watch list based on their behavior in stores.\nWhen agents saw someone commit a crime \u2013 or just do something suspicious, one said \u2013 they scrolled through profiles on their smartphone to search for the individual, only adding the person to the watch list with a manager\u2019s approval. The next time the shopper walked into a Rite Aid that had the technology, agents received a phone alert and checked the match for accuracy. Then they could order the person to leave, agents told Reuters.\nRite Aid said adding customers to the watch list was based on \u201cmultiple layers of meaningful human review.\u201d The company told Reuters its procedures ensured customers were not confronted unnecessarily.\nIf a person was found to be engaging in criminal behavior, Rite Aid said, \u201cwe retain the data as a matter of policy to cooperate in pending or potential criminal investigations.\u201d\nOther U.S. retail stores have tried DeepCam. Independent 7-Eleven franchise owners in Virginia told Reuters they conducted trials of the software starting in 2018 and later dropped it. They said they largely found the system accurate but not user friendly and too expensive to maintain. The system was advertised online as costing $99 a month.\n7-Eleven Inc did not answer requests for comment.\nTHE CHINA CONNECTION\nThe two founding owners of U.S.-based DeepCam LLC were Don Knasel and Jingfeng Liu, who set up the firm in Longmont, Colorado, in 2017, state records show. Liu\u2019s residential address in Longmont was listed as its headquarters.\nA Chinese native with U.S. citizenship and a doctorate from Carnegie Mellon University, Liu had the skills to do business in both the United States and China.\nAccording to China\u2019s official business registration records, he is chairman of another facial recognition firm in China called Shenzhen Shenmu Information Technology Co Ltd, whose website is DeepCam.com.\nFor a time, the U.S.-based DeepCam LLC and Shenzhen Shenmu were closely connected: In addition to Liu\u2019s role in both companies, they shared the same website and email accounts, according to internal records seen by Reuters.\nInternal correspondence reviewed by Reuters suggests that DeepCam reached a deal with Rite Aid by March 2018, when a colleague emailed Knasel to congratulate him. Internal records also indicated that China-based Shenzhen Shenmu helped its American counterpart with product development and that Liu was expected to pay at least some of the bills. That same month, a U.S. executive wrote: \u201cHi Jingfeng- Thanks for the credit card. Here is the receipt for the Indianapolis Trade Show.\u201d\nIn an interview, Liu confirmed the financing, saying of Knasel: \u201cWhenever he needed money, I give him some money.\u201d Liu said Knasel told him about the Rite Aid project but left him in the dark about the business. Knasel \u201cnever let data cross between the two countries,\u201d Liu said.\nAs the Rite Aid rollout proceeded in 2018, correspondence among DeepCam staff, seen by Reuters, expressed concerns about publicly revealing any links to China, as well as using the term \u201cfacial recognition\u201d in the U.S. market for fear of attracting the attention of the American Civil Liberties Union.\nDays after the ACLU wrote a March 2018 blog post here critical of retailers\u2019 suspected use of the technology, including Rite Aid\u2019s, Knasel emailed staff: \u201cIt looks like the ACLU may be starting to stick its head up....We need to tone down facial recognition, which I have tried to do....If they come after us, we are dead....so we have to avoid.\u201d The punctuation in the message is Knasel\u2019s.\nToday, both Liu and Knasel say no ties exist between the U.S. and Chinese businesses.\n\u201cWe never do any business in USA,\u201d Liu wrote in a brief email to Reuters in March. \u201cWe focus in China market.\u201d\nMore recently, in an interview and an email, Liu said he had not spoken with Knasel for more than a year and, to his disappointment, had not benefited from the U.S. venture.\nIn a statement to Reuters, Knasel sought to distance himself from Liu, Shenzhen Shenmu and DeepCam.\nHe did not address questions about DeepCam\u2019s deal with Rite Aid. DeepCam, he said, is \u201cwinding up\u201d its operations and now has no assets. He added that DeepCam never supplied China-based Shenzhen Shenmu with any data.\nIn February, Rite Aid told Reuters that DeepCam had been \u201cre-branded\u201d as pdActive. PdActive is a facial recognition company run by Knasel, who said it is not a rebranding of DeepCam but a different company that has no owners who are Chinese citizens.\nKnasel remained connected to DeepCam through another company he runs, dcAnalytics, which Knasel said licensed DeepCam\u2019s technology until November 2019. Since then, Knasel said, U.S.-based dcAnalytics has been using \u201cproprietary\u201d technology, as well as facial recognition cameras purchased from DeepCam.\nKnasel said dcAnalytics is \u201ccommitted to upholding the highest standards possible to make sure facial recognition technology is used fairly, properly and responsibly.\u201d\nSENSITIVE QUESTIONS\nSteve Dickinson, a Seattle attorney who practiced law in China for more than a decade and writes about cybersecurity, said geopolitical tensions have added sensitivity to any work Chinese surveillance firms do in the United States.\nLast year, the U.S. government blacklisted several Chinese companies \u2013 including Hikvision, one of the biggest surveillance camera manufacturers globally \u2013 alleging involvement in human rights abuses. China has deployed facial recognition cameras widely within its borders, providing a level of monitoring unfathomable to many Americans.\nAt the time, a U.S. Hikvision spokesman said the firm \u201cstrongly opposes\u201d the decision and that punishing Hikvision would harm its U.S. business partners and discourage global companies from communicating with the U.S. government.\nLiu described his company as nothing like the Chinese video surveillance giants. With about 20 employees, he said, it is \u201ca tiny company pretending to be big,\u201d struggling unsuccessfully to get government contracts and nearly bankrupt.\nReuters found that he and his company have financial and other ties to the Chinese government, however.\nMost notably, Shenzhen Shenmu\u2019s largest outside investor, holding about 20% of its registered capital, is a strategic fund set up by the government of China. Called the SME Development Fund (Shenzhen Limited Partnership), it has built a 6 million yuan ($855,000) stake in Shenzhen Shenmu since early 2018, Chinese public business records show.\nA person with the same name as a Shenzhen Shenmu board director has also worked for the venture firm managing the SME fund, according to the records and the investment firm\u2019s website.\nThe fund acknowledged investing in Shenzhen Shenmu and said it \u201cdoes not participate in the daily operation and management of the enterprise.\u201d\nLiu is a member of China\u2019s Thousand Talents program, according to a local government website. That program was started by Beijing as a way to bring top academics working in important fields abroad back to China. According to allegations here by the U.S. Justice Department, the program aimed to steal foreign technology.\nIn a statement, China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs described such allegations as false and as \u201cstigmatization\u201d by the United States.\nLiu told Reuters he tried to get into the program but does not know if he is. The achievement was reported in an article on Shenzhen Shenmu\u2019s website, but Liu said he only wanted to use the distinction to help him sell products. Reuters was unable to confirm with China\u2019s government whether Liu was a member.\nAnother website, that of a Shenzhen Shenmu subsidiary, Magicision, claims its technology has helped officials arrest fugitives and suspected criminals in China.\nLiu was vague about the firm\u2019s public security work, saying his company has tried unsuccessfully to get contracts with Chinese law enforcement. He called the website\u2019s information \u201cbullshit marketing.\u201d\nAbout the Chinese government\u2019s interest in his company\u2019s data, however, he was clear.\n\u201cThe China government never care about us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are too small.\u201d\n\u201cI know (the) China threat is a hot, eyeball-attractive topic.

He said crime is particularly bad this year and Trump should consider bringing in the National Guard and using drones to record evidence of crimes as they occur\nOthers were more cautious, saying they feared an increased federal presence would erode civil liberties in a city that has had long-standing problems with police brutality in poor, predominantly Black neighborhoods.\nTrump said last week that hundreds of officers from the FBI and other federal agencies would help fight crime in Chicago. The city is suffering a spike in violent crime, including a drive-by shooting by suspected gang members at a funeral last week that wounded 15 people.\nTrump has sought to project a law-and-order stance as he seeks re-election on Nov. 3, targeting cities controlled by Democrats who he says are soft on criminals. Critics say the administration is seeking to divert attention from its widely criticized response to the coronavirus pandemic.\nEight of 10 people Reuters interviewed in wealthier and safer areas on Chicago\u2019s North Side opposed any form of intervention from Trump, saying federal officers could fan tensions in the city and would not address underlying issues such as unemployment.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how the feds are going to help with anything,\u201d said Michael Flaherty, a 53-year-old architect who lives in Chicago\u2019s Gold Coast neighborhood.\n\u201cThey\u2019re violent.

Lewis in January 2017 said he did not view Trump as a \u201clegitimate\u201d president because of Russian meddling in the 2016 election to boost his candidacy.

It is named for Edmund Pettus, who fought in the Confederate Army and robbed African-Americans of their right to vote after Reconstruction.\nLong before the March on Washington, Lewis helped found the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), which became a prominent civil rights group, and served as its president for three years.\nHe proved he was willing to risk his life for the cause of civil rights and non-violent protest and organized the first lunch-counter sit-ins demanding service for Blacks at whites-only eateries.\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\nIn 1960, at a whites-only diner in Nashville, Tennessee, a white waitress dumped cleaning powder down his back and water on his food. He was beaten by whites in South Carolina and Alabama during 1961 anti-segregation bus tours called Freedom Rides. And he suffered further injuries during \u201cBloody Sunday\u201d in 1965 in Selma.\n\u201cI thought I was going to die a few times,\u201d he said in a 2004 interview, mentioning Selma and a 1961 mob beating at a bus station in Montgomery, Alabama. \u201cI thought I saw death, but nothing can make me question the philosophy of non-violence.\u201d\nBarack Obama, the first Black U.S. president, awarded Lewis the presidential medal of freedom, America\u2019s highest civilian honor, in 2011.\n\u201cGenerations from now, when parents teach their children what is meant by courage, the story of John Lewis will come to mind - an American who knew that change could not wait for some other person or some other time, whose life is a lesson in the fierce urgency of now,\u201d Obama said a White House ceremony.\nLewis was born on Feb. 21, 1940, in Troy, Alabama, when Blacks faced segregation in all public facilities and were effectively barred from voting in the U.S. South - where Black slavery ended only due to the 1861-1865 Civil War - thanks to the notorious \u201cJim Crow\u201d laws.\n\u2018I FELT SO FREE\u2019\nLewis plunged into the civil rights movement as a student at Fisk University in Nashville, where he organized the sit-ins at segregated lunch counters.\n\u201cThe Nashville sit-ins became the first mass arrest in the sit-in movement, and I was taken to jail,\u201d Lewis said.\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you, I felt so liberated. I felt so free. I felt like I had crossed over. I think I said to myself, \u2018What else can you do to me? You beat me. You harassed me. Now you have placed me under arrest. You put us in jail. What\u2019s left? You can kill us?\u2019\u201d\nThe \u201cBloody Sunday\u201d attack took place when segregationist Alabama Governor George Wallace directed police to use night sticks and tear gas to stop the peaceful march for voting rights led by Lewis and others.\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\nAs hundreds of Black protesters crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge, state troopers, many on horseback, waded into the crowd swinging billy clubs. Lewis was beaten so badly that his scars were visible decades later when he served in Congress.\nThe horrific nature of the event inspired action in Washington. President Lyndon Johnson days later demanded that Congress approve legislation removing barriers to Black voting. Lawmakers then passed the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965.\nIn a moving postscript to his protest years, Elwin Wilson, a white man who assaulted Lewis at a bus station in Rock Hill, South Carolina, in 1961, traveled to Washington in 2009 to apologize tearfully to Lewis, who forgave him.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what the movement was always about - to have the capacity to forgive and move toward reconciliation,\u201d Lewis told the New York Times in 2013 after Wilson died at age 76.\nAfter leaving SNCC in 1966, Lewis worked for community organizations. He later was Democratic President Jimmy Carter\u2019s choice to head the federal volunteer program ACTION and he was elected to the Atlanta City Council in 1981.\nLewis lost his first run for the House in 1977 to Democrat Wyche Fowler in the campaign to replace Andrew Young, the first Black elected to Congress from Georgia in modern times.

A \u201cREOPEN our SCHOOLS\u201d protest is set for July 30 in Phoenix in support of Ducey\u2019s mandate that in-person classes resume Aug. 17, after the Deer Valley Unified School District delayed their start until Oct. 14.\n\u201cAll we want is our choices back,\u201d said protest organizer Christina DeRouchey, the mother of four school-age children.\n\u2018RED FOR ED\u2019\nTeachers wearing \u201cRed for Ed\u201d t-shirts - the same garb they wore during a successful week-long pay strike two years ago -- are planning a much larger motor march July 22 to circle the state capitol and governor\u2019s office.\nThe red shirts are a symbol of nationwide strikes by educators over the past few years that some believe may be rekindled this fall.\nArizona teachers are not alone in their protests. Teacher unions across the nation, especially those recently entangled in labor battles, are organizing to become active participants in when and how to re-open schools.\nThe United Teachers Los Angeles have won an indefinite delay to in-person learning. Others in more conservative states such as Florida are trying to push back classroom start dates and boost funding for personal protective equipment.\n\u201cThis is a core piece of what our educators come together for, which is to demand that schools are properly funded,\u201d said Joe Thomas, president of the Arizona Education Association (AEA) \u201cUntil we can see that, we are not ready to come back to schools.\u201d\nMuch like they did in 2018, Arizona educators are using social media hashtags and online petitions to demand schools not have funding reduced if students switch to remote learning.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to compare it to our walkout in 2018,\u201d said Kelley Fisher, a kindergarten teacher who helped organize the walkout campaign in 2018. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair to put any child or any teacher or any family\u2019s life at stake because they have to open a school building.\u201d\nDucey, who has the authority to open or close schools, moved the start of school back until Aug. 17, a delay of one or two weeks for most districts in response to the rise in coronavirus cases. Some have decided to begin the school year with remote learning while others will implement online and in-person instruction.\nDucey said on Thursday he will finalize his decision on the re-opening of schools next week after he speaks with educators around the state.\n\u201cOur kids are going to be learning in the fall.

REUTERS/Suzi Altman NO RESALES. NO ARCHIVES\nAt age 87, Jay is as stubborn as ever about his walks.\nSome days he leaves home in a crisply pressed suit, rolling behind him a hot-pink suitcase he got from a granddaughter who outgrew its color.\nHe uses it to carry his books for sale \u2013 many of them self-published and printed at the local Kinko\u2019s. People recognize him, though not as much as they used to.\nOne of Jay\u2019s books, written decades ago, is called \u201cLetters To My Unborn Grandchildren.\u201d Judy and Jay have 11 grandkids now, but he hadn\u2019t always counted on meeting them.\u202f The civil rights years were a dangerous time for Jay.\n\u201cAll I had to lose was my life,\u201d he wrote to them about that period. And he almost had, when he was gunned down by a white man in 1966.\nThis year, life has become dangerous again.\u202f The other day Judy overheard Jay refuse a coronavirus test when his doctor called with concerns. Jay\u2019s picture had appeared in the newspaper. He\u2019d been at the park, talking to a group of suburban white kids wearing Black Lives Matter shirts. His age and diabetes make him vulnerable to the virus.\n\u201cI\u2019ve just never known Jay to have any fear,\u201d Judy says.\nJay says he\u2019ll leave to God how many more walks he\u2019ll take, or how many more days he\u2019ll have with Judy, his wife of 39 years.\nShe\u2019s 16 years younger, but at 71, Judy is also at high risk. Coronavirus cases have surged in the state since last month, when most Mississippi businesses were allowed to reopen. The majority of Mississippians infected, and killed, have been Black.\nThe virus demands caution, but Judy and Jay haven\u2019t just stayed locked in. America is experiencing a moment of reckoning on race, and they want to bear witness to the changes it brings.\nOne day last month, on Juneteenth, they ventured out to the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum. It was still closed because of the pandemic, but the Merediths are always welcome.\nSome things are familiar about this summer. The grandkids stop by in the daytime, cautiously, and the couple share home-cooked dinners while their dog, Charlie, steals scraps off Jay\u2019s plate. Outside, the magnolia trees have bloomed and the asphalt roads have softened under the heat.\nBut so much else has changed. During the height of a pandemic, people of all skin colors have taken to the streets of Jackson, and cities everywhere, to demand reforms after George Floyd\u2019s killing by a white police officer in Minneapolis. Mississippi has taken down its 126-year-old flag, the last state banner to feature the Confederate battle emblem. On Tuesday, the University of Mississippi, Ole Miss, removed a Confederate monument from the center of campus and put it in a Civil War graveyard.\nNot for the first time, the Merediths see their lives, and those of their family, intersecting with momentous, history-shaping events.\nIn 1965, the Voting Rights Act gave Blacks the vote, but they faced white intimidation against registering. So the next year, Jay undertook a 220-mile solitary \u201cwalk against fear,\u201d starting over the Tennessee state line in Memphis.\nAfter walking by Elvis Presley\u2019s Graceland mansion and entering Mississippi, he saw a white man waiting with a shotgun off Highway 51. The man, a hardware store clerk, called out his name, and then shot him three times. National radio broke into programming to announce that he was dead. But he was still breathing.\nMississippi had a long history of racial violence against Blacks, but this ambush was different: It had all been caught on camera. The image of Jay writhing on the ground transfixed America, much like the video of George Floyd this year.\nJudy calls her husband Jay. Others in their family call him J-Boy or Uncle J-Boy. But he\u2019s better known, in Mississippi and in history books, as James Meredith.\nTHE LAST BATTLE OF THE CIVIL WAR\nThe shooting wasn\u2019t Jay\u2019s first time in the line of fire.\nIn December 1962, Bob Dylan recorded the song \u201cOxford Town\u201d about him. At the time, Dylan was still an up-and-coming musician and Meredith was one of the most hated and admired men in America.\nHe went down to Oxford Town\nGuns and clubs followed him down\nAll because his face was brown\nBetter get away from Oxford Town\nThat year, Meredith had orchestrated one of the biggest victories of the American civil rights era when he became the first Black to attend Ole Miss in Oxford.\nThe school had been an all-white bastion of the Old South. The segregationist governor, Democrat Ross Barnett, had arrived on the scene to block Meredith\u2019s entry himself. White mobs in Oxford wanted him dead. But Meredith, an Air Force veteran, compelled the federal government to send more than 30,000 U.S. troops to uphold his right as a citizen to attend.\nHe had created one of the tensest moments of John F. Kennedy\u2019s presidency. Some historians have likened it to the last battle of the Civil War.\nGrowing up in Gary, Indiana, Judy watched these events on TV. \u201cLet\u2019s see if James Meredith survived another day,\u201d she remembers her father saying when he turned on the nightly news.\nJudy remembers her church preacher asking congregants to pray for Meredith, and she had. She also remembers her mother and aunt talking about him. \u201cThat James Meredith is one good-looking man,\u201d they used to say.\n\u201cI thought that was the best reality TV ever made,\u201d Judy says. It was one of the reasons she embarked on a career in broadcast journalism.\nWhat Jay did at Ole Miss has opened the doors for Judy, too.\nIn their living room, Dr. Judy Meredith takes down her PhD degree from Mississippi State University to demonstrate. She\u2019s been a TV news reporter and anchor, a Fulbright scholar, a music teacher, a university professor.\nToday, Judy and Jay live in Jackson\u2019s Fondren neighborhood, a leafy, mostly white upper-middle-class area. Still, huge racial disparities remain in the state.\nThese are evident, Judy says, in the surge of coronavirus cases among Blacks here, a sign of enduring economic and health deficits. Blacks make up 38% of the state\u2019s population, but they\u2019ve accounted for 54% of positive tests and half of all deaths among cases in which race has been reported. Things have grown dire this week, with many of the state\u2019s intensive-care units already reaching capacity and Republican Gov. Tate Reeves entreating Mississippians to mask up.\nThe divides are also on display at public schools. Many in Jackson are nearly all Black, and others in the suburbs nearly all white. Even at Ole Miss, Blacks still make up only 13% of the student body.\nIn other ways, Judy says, it\u2019s more subtle.\nAs an older Black woman in the Deep South, she\u2019s noticed something at the supermarket and in department stores: White women coming down the aisles expect her to move out of their way, she says.\nShe\u2019s mentioned this to friends, white ladies she lunches with. Sometimes she is met with blank stares.\n\u201cThey do it without even noticing,\u201d Judy says.\nIn recent years, Judy has begun playing a polite Southern game of chicken with white ladies at the stores. She\u2019s all smiles, but she stands her ground and waits for them to move out of her way.\nRecently, during long hours at home, Judy has been moved to tears when the couple watch George Floyd\u2019s killing. The footage has been inescapable.\nSlideshow ( 4 images )\n\u201cIt is terrible, disgusting,\u201d Judy says. But she has trouble understanding why it has prompted such an outpouring. Why now? There have been many other videos depicting police brutality against Blacks. None of them sent millions of protesters into the streets or brought down the Mississippi flag.\nJay says he knows why. The fuse was lit, this time, not just by Floyd\u2019s death, but by lockdowns, soaring unemployment, hunger, pent-up anger.\n\u201cThe pandemic,\u201d he says, \u201cset up America for an explosion.\u201d\nA FUNERAL AND A WEDDING\nAt the Civil Rights Museum, Judy does most of the talking. Even though the place is shut to visitors, a sound system is pumping loud spiritual music, and Jay\u2019s hearing is going. \u201cI\u2019m happy to be a sideshow,\u201d he says.\nHe\u2019s also wary. Few reporters have ever understood him, he says, admitting that he likes to confound people. One exception, he says, was the late Bill Minor, often considered the dean of Mississippi journalism. (The observation people remember by Minor \u2013 the one uttered through the Southern grapevine ever since \u2013 is this one: \u201cJames Meredith is crazy.\u201d It\u2019s something Jay doesn\u2019t exactly deny, either. Back at Ole Miss, he\u2019d trained himself never to blink when whites threw firecrackers at his feet.)\nBut at their home the next day, they both wax on during an interview that lasts four hours \u2013 at a safe social distance.\nThey describe how they met, in 1981. Jay was on his way to a funeral in Indiana.\nTwo years earlier, his first wife, Mary June, had died of a heart attack at age 41, leaving Jay with three boys to raise. Judy was a single mother too, with a son from an earlier marriage.\nIf she was starstruck by the man she\u2019d watched on TV two decades earlier, she didn\u2019t show it that day. \u201cI didn\u2019t want him getting any ideas,\u201d she says.\nHe got ideas anyway. Later, at the funeral in Indiana, he peered at the casket and then turned to their mutual friend: \u201cAin\u2019t nothing I can do for this man, so take me back to that woman.\u201d\nFor the next several weeks, Judy and Jay courted over long-distance calls that lasted until dawn. They exchanged family histories, and bonded over their childhoods, so similar even though they came from North and South, city and country. They debated current events.\nJudy was sharp, not shy about challenging Jay. She reminded him of his mother, Miss Roxie, a proud \u201cbelle of the county\u201d who took no sass from Jay, his nine siblings, or anyone else.\n\u201cI ain\u2019t never told nobody this,\u201d Jay says. \u201cBut I have one of the biggest egos in the world.\u201d\nAt that, Judy says, \u201cMmmm-hmmm.\u201d\nThey married 10 weeks after they met. Early in their life together, there were times when she bristled at his stubbornness. She left once, back to Gary. Jay went north and won her back.\n\u201cNow every time I leave home, I check to make sure she\u2019s still here,\u201d he says.\nLast year, Judy finished a short documentary about her husband called \u201cWho Is James Meredith?\u201d Before the pandemic hit, it was having a good run at film festivals.\nGiven their age difference, she seems aware that she will likely be a torchbearer for his legacy.\nIt\u2019s a complicated one.\nAt many turns, Jay has inflamed civil rights groups and would-be supporters. He\u2019s never wanted to be part of a movement, often preferring individual action or lone \u201cwalks\u201d to collective marches.\nSome of his actions have been unorthodox, to say the least.\nLike the time in the 1990s he supported David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan leader, for governor of Louisiana. Or when, earlier, he\u2019d endorsed the reelection of Mississippi Gov. Barnett, the man who\u2019d tried to block his way at Ole Miss.\nHe says everything he\u2019s done in life has followed a plan \u2013 a \u201cdivine mission\u201d \u2013 to dismantle white supremacy, including by showing no fear to its figureheads. In politics, he wants Blacks to know what they\u2019re up against.\n\u201cI prefer bigotry to be out in the open where I can confront it,\u201d he wrote to his unborn grandkids.\nHe has also courted controversy with speeches that veer into performance art.\nOne time, in a talk at his alma mater Ole Miss, he played the song \u201cShake Your Money Maker\u201d by Mississippi bluesman Elmore James, breaking into dance moves and telling students it was the most important thing they could learn about the Black experience in America.\nEverybody knows what the song is about, Jay says, but nobody wants to say it.\n\u201cI ain\u2019t gonna say it,\u201d Judy says.\n\u201cIt means you gotta shake your booty,\u201d Jay says, bursting into a laugh that detaches his dentures from his gums.\nA FAMILY AFFAIR\nFor all Jay\u2019s \u201clone wolf\u201d agitation and egotism over the years, what\u2019s most important to him is family.\nBoth he and Judy grew up in families that went to extremes to shield them, as children, from the ugliness of racism.\nJudy, born to a Black father and white mother, had been given up at birth. She was adopted at age 3 by parents from East Texas who had migrated north, like millions of other Blacks.\nShe grew up within earshot of the childhood home of Michael Jackson. The sound of the Jackson 5\u2019s daily band practices filled the street.\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t not hear them,\u201d she says.\nHer own gift for music was evident before kindergarten, and she spent her childhood almost always near a piano, at home, church and school. It was a sheltered existence, and Judy says her parents \u201cnever talked about race relations.\u201d\nShe remembers one moment when reality intruded, while riding with her mother on a trip down to East Texas.\n\u201cThis little white boy, riding a bike, called my mom n---er,\u201d she says. \u201cShe hollered out the window, \u2018Peckerwood,\u2019 but we didn\u2019t talk about it; she didn\u2019t stop to tell me what was going on.\u201d\nJay was raised on an 84-acre farm in Kosciusko, Mississippi (perhaps best known these days as the hometown of Oprah Winfrey). His father, Cap, instructed Jay that nothing could hold him back and he would be called upon to lead. As the Black owner of a sizable farm, Cap was well off for his time. He built fences several feet inside the property line so they could be maintained without bickering with white neighbors, with whom Jay had scarce contact.\nJay remembers the exact moment, at age 15, when he discovered that Southern whites viewed him as inferior.\nIt was on a 1948 train ride back from a family road trip to Chicago. When the train reached Memphis, the conductor ordered him and his brother to leave their seats, for which they\u2019d paid full fare, and go stand in the \u201ccolored car.\u201d\nJay says he cried all the way back to Mississippi.\n\u201cI cried, but I also started scheming.\u201d\nScheming, he says, to accept no Mississippi in which he or his kind could be degraded, just as his father, Cap, had done with his farm.\nHe talks at length about earlier generations, what they endured, inherited and passed down.\n\u201cMost of my life happened before I was born,\u201d Jay says.\nJudy and Jay share a vision of family as a relay of sorts, over the arc of time, in which each generation can, and must, seize a new set of gains.\nTheir son Joseph personified this, graduating summa cum laude from Harvard and later winning the outstanding doctoral student award at Ole Miss. Twelve years ago, Joseph died of lupus at age 39.\nA NEW GENERATION AT \u201cNEW MISS\u201d\nIn one of his letters to his grandchildren, Jay wrote: \u201cLife in America is combat.\u201d\nOle Miss was a war zone when Meredith arrived in Oxford in 1962. Thousands of white men, many of them armed, faced off against outnumbered federal marshals, the night sky illuminated by explosions. Two people died, hundreds were injured, and Jay slept through it all in a dorm room.\nToday, Judy and Jay think of Mississippi not only as home but as \u201cthe center of the universe.\u201d\nThis might seem improbable. It\u2019s the poorest of the 50 U.S. states, with the lowest life expectancy. People in Jackson sometimes joke that its streets have potholes big enough to catch catfish from.\nBut when change comes to Mississippi, the couple say, it has a tendency to reverberate elsewhere.\n\u201cNobody wants to be behind Mississippi,\u201d Jay says.\nIn a generation, Mississippi has gone from the epitome of segregation to a place where scores of Ole Miss students and alumni approach Jay for handshakes or autographs when the couple attend a football game there.\nNever mind, Judy says, that a few of the alumni might have yelled the N-word at Jay back in 1962.\nIn 2006, Judy and Jay attended the unveiling of a statue of him on campus. At first, he had mixed feelings about the statue. For one, he wasn\u2019t invited to the podium to speak at the ceremony. (The actor Morgan Freeman was among those enlisted to talk about him instead. Asked about the unveiling, an Ole Miss representative said, \u201cJames Meredith is one of our most notable alumni; however, we are not able to confirm those details from the event from 14 years ago.\u201d)\nIn 2014, the statue was defaced by white students who placed a noose around its neck along with a Confederate symbol. Afterward, a Black student guarded the statue for months, holding a daily vigil. It has become a popular gathering and protest spot for students, most recently in protective face masks.\n\u201cThe past is never dead. It\u2019s not even past,\u201d wrote another Ole Miss alumnus and a son of Oxford, the novelist William Faulkner. The writer died just a few months before Meredith\u2019s arrival on campus in 1962, but his nephew was in a National Guard unit deployed to protect Meredith. He was attacked by rioters throwing bricks and broke an arm.\nJudy and Jay have a granddaughter, Jylah Meredith Knight, who plans to start as a freshman at Ole Miss in the fall.\nIt isn\u2019t yet clear whether it will be safe for Jylah to attend classes on campus, but unlike her grandfather, she\u2019s in the same predicament as all students.

REUTERS/Suzi Altman NO RESALES. NO ARCHIVES\nAt age 87, Jay is as stubborn as ever about his walks.\nSome days he leaves home in a crisply pressed suit, rolling behind him a hot-pink suitcase he got from a granddaughter who outgrew its color.\nHe uses it to carry his books for sale \u2013 many of them self-published and printed at the local Kinko\u2019s. People recognize him, though not as much as they used to.\nOne of Jay\u2019s books, written decades ago, is called \u201cLetters To My Unborn Grandchildren.\u201d Judy and Jay have 11 grandkids now, but he hadn\u2019t always counted on meeting them.\u202f The civil rights years were a dangerous time for Jay.\n\u201cAll I had to lose was my life,\u201d he wrote to them about that period. And he almost had, when he was gunned down by a white man in 1966.\nThis year, life has become dangerous again.\u202f The other day Judy overheard Jay refuse a coronavirus test when his doctor called with concerns. Jay\u2019s picture had appeared in the newspaper. He\u2019d been at the park, talking to a group of suburban white kids wearing Black Lives Matter shirts. His age and diabetes make him vulnerable to the virus.\n\u201cI\u2019ve just never known Jay to have any fear,\u201d Judy says.\nJay says he\u2019ll leave to God how many more walks he\u2019ll take, or how many more days he\u2019ll have with Judy, his wife of 39 years.\nShe\u2019s 16 years younger, but at 71, Judy is also at high risk. Coronavirus cases have surged in the state since last month, when most Mississippi businesses were allowed to reopen. The majority of Mississippians infected, and killed, have been Black.\nThe virus demands caution, but Judy and Jay haven\u2019t just stayed locked in. America is experiencing a moment of reckoning on race, and they want to bear witness to the changes it brings.\nOne day last month, on Juneteenth, they ventured out to the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum. It was still closed because of the pandemic, but the Merediths are always welcome.\nSome things are familiar about this summer. The grandkids stop by in the daytime, cautiously, and the couple share home-cooked dinners while their dog, Charlie, steals scraps off Jay\u2019s plate. Outside, the magnolia trees have bloomed and the asphalt roads have softened under the heat.\nBut so much else has changed. During the height of a pandemic, people of all skin colors have taken to the streets of Jackson, and cities everywhere, to demand reforms after George Floyd\u2019s killing by a white police officer in Minneapolis. Mississippi has taken down its 126-year-old flag, the last state banner to feature the Confederate battle emblem. On Tuesday, the University of Mississippi, Ole Miss, removed a Confederate monument from the center of campus and put it in a Civil War graveyard.\nNot for the first time, the Merediths see their lives, and those of their family, intersecting with momentous, history-shaping events.\nIn 1965, the Voting Rights Act gave Blacks the vote, but they faced white intimidation against registering. So the next year, Jay undertook a 220-mile solitary \u201cwalk against fear,\u201d starting over the Tennessee state line in Memphis.\nAfter walking by Elvis Presley\u2019s Graceland mansion and entering Mississippi, he saw a white man waiting with a shotgun off Highway 51. The man, a hardware store clerk, called out his name, and then shot him three times. National radio broke into programming to announce that he was dead. But he was still breathing.\nMississippi had a long history of racial violence against Blacks, but this ambush was different: It had all been caught on camera. The image of Jay writhing on the ground transfixed America, much like the video of George Floyd this year.\nJudy calls her husband Jay. Others in their family call him J-Boy or Uncle J-Boy. But he\u2019s better known, in Mississippi and in history books, as James Meredith.\nTHE LAST BATTLE OF THE CIVIL WAR\nThe shooting wasn\u2019t Jay\u2019s first time in the line of fire.\nIn December 1962, Bob Dylan recorded the song \u201cOxford Town\u201d about him. At the time, Dylan was still an up-and-coming musician and Meredith was one of the most hated and admired men in America.\nHe went down to Oxford Town\nGuns and clubs followed him down\nAll because his face was brown\nBetter get away from Oxford Town\nThat year, Meredith had orchestrated one of the biggest victories of the American civil rights era when he became the first Black to attend Ole Miss in Oxford.\nThe school had been an all-white bastion of the Old South. The segregationist governor, Democrat Ross Barnett, had arrived on the scene to block Meredith\u2019s entry himself. White mobs in Oxford wanted him dead. But Meredith, an Air Force veteran, compelled the federal government to send more than 30,000 U.S. troops to uphold his right as a citizen to attend.\nHe had created one of the tensest moments of John F. Kennedy\u2019s presidency. Some historians have likened it to the last battle of the Civil War.\nGrowing up in Gary, Indiana, Judy watched these events on TV. \u201cLet\u2019s see if James Meredith survived another day,\u201d she remembers her father saying when he turned on the nightly news.\nJudy remembers her church preacher asking congregants to pray for Meredith, and she had. She also remembers her mother and aunt talking about him. \u201cThat James Meredith is one good-looking man,\u201d they used to say.\n\u201cI thought that was the best reality TV ever made,\u201d Judy says. It was one of the reasons she embarked on a career in broadcast journalism.\nWhat Jay did at Ole Miss has opened the doors for Judy, too.\nIn their living room, Dr. Judy Meredith takes down her PhD degree from Mississippi State University to demonstrate. She\u2019s been a TV news reporter and anchor, a Fulbright scholar, a music teacher, a university professor.\nToday, Judy and Jay live in Jackson\u2019s Fondren neighborhood, a leafy, mostly white upper-middle-class area. Still, huge racial disparities remain in the state.\nThese are evident, Judy says, in the surge of coronavirus cases among Blacks here, a sign of enduring economic and health deficits. Blacks make up 38% of the state\u2019s population, but they\u2019ve accounted for 54% of positive tests and half of all deaths among cases in which race has been reported. Things have grown dire this week, with many of the state\u2019s intensive-care units already reaching capacity and Republican Gov. Tate Reeves entreating Mississippians to mask up.\nThe divides are also on display at public schools. Many in Jackson are nearly all Black, and others in the suburbs nearly all white. Even at Ole Miss, Blacks still make up only 13% of the student body.\nIn other ways, Judy says, it\u2019s more subtle.\nAs an older Black woman in the Deep South, she\u2019s noticed something at the supermarket and in department stores: White women coming down the aisles expect her to move out of their way, she says.\nShe\u2019s mentioned this to friends, white ladies she lunches with. Sometimes she is met with blank stares.\n\u201cThey do it without even noticing,\u201d Judy says.\nIn recent years, Judy has begun playing a polite Southern game of chicken with white ladies at the stores. She\u2019s all smiles, but she stands her ground and waits for them to move out of her way.\nRecently, during long hours at home, Judy has been moved to tears when the couple watch George Floyd\u2019s killing. The footage has been inescapable.\nSlideshow ( 4 images )\n\u201cIt is terrible, disgusting,\u201d Judy says. But she has trouble understanding why it has prompted such an outpouring. Why now? There have been many other videos depicting police brutality against Blacks. None of them sent millions of protesters into the streets or brought down the Mississippi flag.\nJay says he knows why. The fuse was lit, this time, not just by Floyd\u2019s death, but by lockdowns, soaring unemployment, hunger, pent-up anger.\n\u201cThe pandemic,\u201d he says, \u201cset up America for an explosion.\u201d\nA FUNERAL AND A WEDDING\nAt the Civil Rights Museum, Judy does most of the talking. Even though the place is shut to visitors, a sound system is pumping loud spiritual music, and Jay\u2019s hearing is going. \u201cI\u2019m happy to be a sideshow,\u201d he says.\nHe\u2019s also wary. Few reporters have ever understood him, he says, admitting that he likes to confound people. One exception, he says, was the late Bill Minor, often considered the dean of Mississippi journalism. (The observation people remember by Minor \u2013 the one uttered through the Southern grapevine ever since \u2013 is this one: \u201cJames Meredith is crazy.\u201d It\u2019s something Jay doesn\u2019t exactly deny, either. Back at Ole Miss, he\u2019d trained himself never to blink when whites threw firecrackers at his feet.)\nBut at their home the next day, they both wax on during an interview that lasts four hours \u2013 at a safe social distance.\nThey describe how they met, in 1981. Jay was on his way to a funeral in Indiana.\nTwo years earlier, his first wife, Mary June, had died of a heart attack at age 41, leaving Jay with three boys to raise. Judy was a single mother too, with a son from an earlier marriage.\nIf she was starstruck by the man she\u2019d watched on TV two decades earlier, she didn\u2019t show it that day. \u201cI didn\u2019t want him getting any ideas,\u201d she says.\nHe got ideas anyway. Later, at the funeral in Indiana, he peered at the casket and then turned to their mutual friend: \u201cAin\u2019t nothing I can do for this man, so take me back to that woman.\u201d\nFor the next several weeks, Judy and Jay courted over long-distance calls that lasted until dawn. They exchanged family histories, and bonded over their childhoods, so similar even though they came from North and South, city and country. They debated current events.\nJudy was sharp, not shy about challenging Jay. She reminded him of his mother, Miss Roxie, a proud \u201cbelle of the county\u201d who took no sass from Jay, his nine siblings, or anyone else.\n\u201cI ain\u2019t never told nobody this,\u201d Jay says. \u201cBut I have one of the biggest egos in the world.\u201d\nAt that, Judy says, \u201cMmmm-hmmm.\u201d\nThey married 10 weeks after they met. Early in their life together, there were times when she bristled at his stubbornness. She left once, back to Gary. Jay went north and won her back.\n\u201cNow every time I leave home, I check to make sure she\u2019s still here,\u201d he says.\nLast year, Judy finished a short documentary about her husband called \u201cWho Is James Meredith?\u201d Before the pandemic hit, it was having a good run at film festivals.\nGiven their age difference, she seems aware that she will likely be a torchbearer for his legacy.\nIt\u2019s a complicated one.\nAt many turns, Jay has inflamed civil rights groups and would-be supporters. He\u2019s never wanted to be part of a movement, often preferring individual action or lone \u201cwalks\u201d to collective marches.\nSome of his actions have been unorthodox, to say the least.\nLike the time in the 1990s he supported David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan leader, for governor of Louisiana. Or when, earlier, he\u2019d endorsed the reelection of Mississippi Gov. Barnett, the man who\u2019d tried to block his way at Ole Miss.\nHe says everything he\u2019s done in life has followed a plan \u2013 a \u201cdivine mission\u201d \u2013 to dismantle white supremacy, including by showing no fear to its figureheads. In politics, he wants Blacks to know what they\u2019re up against.\n\u201cI prefer bigotry to be out in the open where I can confront it,\u201d he wrote to his unborn grandkids.\nHe has also courted controversy with speeches that veer into performance art.\nOne time, in a talk at his alma mater Ole Miss, he played the song \u201cShake Your Money Maker\u201d by Mississippi bluesman Elmore James, breaking into dance moves and telling students it was the most important thing they could learn about the Black experience in America.\nEverybody knows what the song is about, Jay says, but nobody wants to say it.\n\u201cI ain\u2019t gonna say it,\u201d Judy says.\n\u201cIt means you gotta shake your booty,\u201d Jay says, bursting into a laugh that detaches his dentures from his gums.\nA FAMILY AFFAIR\nFor all Jay\u2019s \u201clone wolf\u201d agitation and egotism over the years, what\u2019s most important to him is family.\nBoth he and Judy grew up in families that went to extremes to shield them, as children, from the ugliness of racism.\nJudy, born to a Black father and white mother, had been given up at birth. She was adopted at age 3 by parents from East Texas who had migrated north, like millions of other Blacks.\nShe grew up within earshot of the childhood home of Michael Jackson. The sound of the Jackson 5\u2019s daily band practices filled the street.\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t not hear them,\u201d she says.\nHer own gift for music was evident before kindergarten, and she spent her childhood almost always near a piano, at home, church and school. It was a sheltered existence, and Judy says her parents \u201cnever talked about race relations.\u201d\nShe remembers one moment when reality intruded, while riding with her mother on a trip down to East Texas.\n\u201cThis little white boy, riding a bike, called my mom n---er,\u201d she says. \u201cShe hollered out the window, \u2018Peckerwood,\u2019 but we didn\u2019t talk about it; she didn\u2019t stop to tell me what was going on.\u201d\nJay was raised on an 84-acre farm in Kosciusko, Mississippi (perhaps best known these days as the hometown of Oprah Winfrey). His father, Cap, instructed Jay that nothing could hold him back and he would be called upon to lead. As the Black owner of a sizable farm, Cap was well off for his time. He built fences several feet inside the property line so they could be maintained without bickering with white neighbors, with whom Jay had scarce contact.\nJay remembers the exact moment, at age 15, when he discovered that Southern whites viewed him as inferior.\nIt was on a 1948 train ride back from a family road trip to Chicago. When the train reached Memphis, the conductor ordered him and his brother to leave their seats, for which they\u2019d paid full fare, and go stand in the \u201ccolored car.\u201d\nJay says he cried all the way back to Mississippi.\n\u201cI cried, but I also started scheming.\u201d\nScheming, he says, to accept no Mississippi in which he or his kind could be degraded, just as his father, Cap, had done with his farm.\nHe talks at length about earlier generations, what they endured, inherited and passed down.\n\u201cMost of my life happened before I was born,\u201d Jay says.\nJudy and Jay share a vision of family as a relay of sorts, over the arc of time, in which each generation can, and must, seize a new set of gains.\nTheir son Joseph personified this, graduating summa cum laude from Harvard and later winning the outstanding doctoral student award at Ole Miss. Twelve years ago, Joseph died of lupus at age 39.\nA NEW GENERATION AT \u201cNEW MISS\u201d\nIn one of his letters to his grandchildren, Jay wrote: \u201cLife in America is combat.\u201d\nOle Miss was a war zone when Meredith arrived in Oxford in 1962. Thousands of white men, many of them armed, faced off against outnumbered federal marshals, the night sky illuminated by explosions. Two people died, hundreds were injured, and Jay slept through it all in a dorm room.\nToday, Judy and Jay think of Mississippi not only as home but as \u201cthe center of the universe.\u201d\nThis might seem improbable. It\u2019s the poorest of the 50 U.S. states, with the lowest life expectancy. People in Jackson sometimes joke that its streets have potholes big enough to catch catfish from.\nBut when change comes to Mississippi, the couple say, it has a tendency to reverberate elsewhere.\n\u201cNobody wants to be behind Mississippi,\u201d Jay says.\nIn a generation, Mississippi has gone from the epitome of segregation to a place where scores of Ole Miss students and alumni approach Jay for handshakes or autographs when the couple attend a football game there.\nNever mind, Judy says, that a few of the alumni might have yelled the N-word at Jay back in 1962.\nIn 2006, Judy and Jay attended the unveiling of a statue of him on campus. At first, he had mixed feelings about the statue. For one, he wasn\u2019t invited to the podium to speak at the ceremony. (The actor Morgan Freeman was among those enlisted to talk about him instead. Asked about the unveiling, an Ole Miss representative said, \u201cJames Meredith is one of our most notable alumni; however, we are not able to confirm those details from the event from 14 years ago.\u201d)\nIn 2014, the statue was defaced by white students who placed a noose around its neck along with a Confederate symbol.

The writer died just a few months before Meredith\u2019s arrival on campus in 1962, but his nephew was in a National Guard unit deployed to protect Meredith. He was attacked by rioters throwing bricks and broke an arm.\nJudy and Jay have a granddaughter, Jylah Meredith Knight, who plans to start as a freshman at Ole Miss in the fall.\nIt isn\u2019t yet clear whether it will be safe for Jylah to attend classes on campus, but unlike her grandfather, she\u2019s in the same predicament as all students.

Following are some quotes from a Reuters television interview with the 17-year-old.\nFILE PHOTO - Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg takes part in a protest outside the EU Council as EU environment ministers meet in Brussels, Belgium, March 5, 2020. REUTERS/Johanna Geron\n* ON CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENVIRONMENTAL BREAKDOWN:\n\u201cIf you are going to going to get healthy, you have to admit that you are sick. And that is something that our leaders cannot seem to do today because they always have to tell this story of success to get re-elected or to become popular.\u201d\n\u201cWe have to admit that this is not a crisis that we can build ourselves out of or invest or buy or consume or produce, because that is the same approach that got us into this crisis.\u201d\n* ON THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE LETTER:\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so new with this open letter is that now we are suddenly saying that we are no longer playing on their terms. Everyone has unknowingly just accepted the fact that we have based everything on the carbon budget which gives us a less than a 50% chance of staying below 1.5C of global average temperature rise - since it excludes so many factors.\n\u201cBut now we are saying that we do not accept those odds and you have to go for the budget which gives us the best possible chance of staying below that target, which is the - also very watered-down - 66%-chance budget.\u201d\n* ON NEED FOR A NEW ECONOMIC SYSTEM:\n\"If you just look at the planned production of fossil fuels that the world's countries are planning to produce by the year 2030, according to the U.N. production gap productiongap.org/2019report report; that accounts for 120% more than what would be consistent with the 1.5 degree (Celcius) targets.\n\u201cSo that means that if we are to stay below these targets, we have to make it possible to tear up and abandon valid contracts and deals.\u201d\n* ON CONNECTIONS BETWEEN CLIMATE AND RACIAL INJUSTICE:\n\u201cBoth of these crises are symptoms of lack of respect for each other and for the natural world ... With the Black Lives Matter protests, it really shows that people are starting to wake up to these injustices and that we can no longer continue to sweep these things under the carpet.\u201d\n* ON HER FEELINGS ABOUT THE FUTURE:\n\u201cIn the beginning, I was very worried. But when I started doing something, then there came hope from that. Because hope comes from action. So, if you don\u2019t want to feel terrified or worried or scared, then the only thing you can do is to take action, because that is the only medicine against that.\u201d\nReporting by Matthew Green and Matthew Stock; Editing by Andrew Heavens\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"url": "/article/idUSKCN24H1ME", "headline": "'Colour-blind' France avoids gauging COVID impact on ethnic minorities", "published_date": "2020-07-16", "text": "By Caroline Pailliez\n5 MIN READ\nPARIS (Reuters) - Back at the start of France\u2019s COVID-19 crisis in February, epidemiologist Cyrille Delpierre encountered a problem when trying to find out what groups of people were falling sick.\nFILE PHOTO: Signs that read \"All together against Coronavirus\" are seen at the main entrance of the Robert Ballanger hospital in Aulnay-sous-Bois near Paris during the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in France.

Washington says the Caesar Act excludes humanitarian aid and aims to hold Assad and his government accountable for war crimes.\nSyrian authorities blame Western sanctions for widespread hardship among ordinary citizens.\nThe Syrian pound, which held steady at around 500 to the dollar for several years, went into free fall last year, hitting a low of 3,000 in June, in anticipation of fresh sanctions.\nThat currency drop is hindering Assad\u2019s plans for buying up all of this year\u2019s wheat to make up for a shortfall in imports that is drawing down on strategic reserves.\nBefore the war, Syria could boast more than a year of wheat reserves.\nThe government declined to answer questions on the current size of reserves and wheat procurement.

But the main wheat regions remain in the hands of Kurdish-led fighters who seized vast territory from Islamic State.\nSyria has had drastically lower output since the conflict erupted. It used to produce 4 million tonnes in a good year and was able to export 1.5 million tonnes.\nThis year, Syria is estimated by the FAO to have produced between 2.1 million and 2.4 million tonnes. The government expects to have produced 2.8 million tonnes.\nDemand across the country is around 4 million tonnes, leaving a shortfall to fill from abroad.\nBut international import tenders conducted by the state\u2019s main grain buyer, Hoboob, have repeatedly failed since last year. The government declined to comment on how many deals it managed to conclude.\nWhile food is not restricted by Western sanctions, banking restrictions and asset freezes have made it difficult for most trading houses to do business with Syria.\nWith major grain traders out of the equation, the government relied on businessmen to conclude transactions to sustain the bread subsidies.\n\u201cThey import quantities to Lebanon and then take it to Syria by land unless it is Russia giving direct shipments, government to government, then they can deliver to (the port of) Latakia,\u201d said Ayman Abdel Nour, a U.S.-based political analyst.\n\u201cNow that window has closed with the problems in Lebanon.\u201d\nReuters data shows that since June 2019, Hoboob has issued at least 10 international tenders for between 100,000 and 200,000 tonnes of wheat, failing to report results for most.\nYoussef Kassem, the head of Hoboob, has been quoted by media as stating that 1.2 million tonnes of Russian wheat imports were contracted throughout 2019 amounting to $310 million. Reuters could not independently verify that information.\nHoboob tried to barter some of Syria\u2019s durum wheat, used in making pasta, for soft bread-making wheat twice in September 2019, with no result announced.\nWhen bread lines started to get longer in government-held areas around March, Russia was urged to send the full amount of the 100,000 tonnes of wheat it had promised as humanitarian aid since 2019.\n\u201cMaybe for the first time since the start of the Syrian uprising, you basically had a shortage of subsidised bread in ovens and that led to the development of a thriving black market,\u201d Elizabeth Tsurkov, Fellow at the U.S.-based Foreign Policy Research Institute think tank and a Syria expert, said.\nRussia, the world\u2019s largest wheat exporter, has been a steady supplier of wheat to Syria but the size of its wheat aid has not met demand.\nRussian customs data does not show supplies to Syria, and the size of real supplies varies wildly.\n\u201cThe supplies are going on. There are however, problems with the payment and availability of vessels ready to deliver to this destination,\u201d a Russian industry source told Reuters.\nThe source estimated only about 150,000 tonnes of commercial wheat had reached Syria between July 2019 and May 2020.\nA RACE FOR RESERVES\nThe government blamed bread lines on technicalities and with the start of its wheat buying season in June announced it would buy every single grain of its local crop.\nBy mid-June, Hoboob said it had so far procured around 212,000 tonnes. FAO estimates that around 700,000 tonnes of the total crop lie in government-controlled territory this year.\nBut the three provinces which account for over 70 percent of production lie mostly in the hands of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), led by the Kurdish YPG militia.\nThe government has historically lured farmers to sell their crop by paying a higher price than its rivals, even as the wheat remained in areas outside its control.\nThis year, with the collapse of the pound, it has upped its price from the 225 pounds a kilo announced at the beginning of the season to 425 pounds.\nBut facing a currency crash and in fear of a ripple effect from Caesar sanctions on the economy of the areas they control, the Kurdish-led authority not only raised its local wheat purchasing price but also pegged it to the going rate of the dollar, pledging to pay 17 U.S. cents a kilo no matter how far the pound slips.\nSalman Barodo, head of the region\u2019s economy and agriculture board, said so far 400,000 tonnes had been bought and warned against any attempts to smuggle the crop outwards.\nThe Kurdish-led authority, that runs the SDF region, is aiming to stockpile 18 months\u2019 worth of supply and only open sales to government territories in the case of a surplus.\nReporting By Maha El Dahan in Dubai and Ellen Francis in Beirut; additional reporting by Suleiman Al Khalidi in Amman and Polina Devitt in Moscow; Editing by Michael Georgy and Nick Macfie\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"url": "/article/idUSKBN24A1AH", "headline": "Special Report: With 'judges judging judges,' rogues on the bench have little to fear", "published_date": "2020-07-09", "text": "By Michael Berens, John Shiffman\n24 MIN READ\nBARTLESVILLE, Oklahoma (Reuters) - District Court Judge Curtis DeLapp was renowned for his hair-trigger temper. Mispronounce his name, come to court a few seconds late, fail to rise as quickly as he\u2019d like \u2013 no slight was too small to set him off.\nThe Washington County Courthouse Judicial Center where Judge Curtis DeLapp sat on the bench is seen in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, U.S. November 19, 2019. REUTERS/Nick Oxford\nFor almost a dozen years, DeLapp used his power to terrify people who appeared before him, pressing contempt charges against defense attorneys, prosecutors and even a prospective juror who brought children to court when she couldn\u2019t find daycare, court records show.\nAnother juror was fined $340.70 after she objected to how DeLapp was treating people who appeared before him. \u201cI never want to be a juror or ever go back to court again,\u201d said Carolyn Duffey Love, now 68. \u201cHe treated me like a dog.\u201d\nIn 2015, DeLapp grew incensed when he learned someone had dropped sunflower seeds in his courtroom, according to witnesses. After scouring footage from a courtroom security camera, the judge summoned a spectator to his chambers, charged her with contempt and ordered her jailed for four days.\nLocal attorneys had grown convinced that DeLapp was violating the state\u2019s judicial conduct code by abusing his authority. But they felt it would be futile to file a complaint with the Oklahoma agency that investigates judicial misconduct, because the state hadn\u2019t filed charges against a judge for misconduct since 2004. The lawyers also say they worried that crossing DeLapp risked retaliation against both them and their clients.\nNot until 2018 \u2013 after DeLapp sentenced courtroom spectator Randa Ludlow to nearly six months in jail for talking to her boyfriend during court \u2013 did local lawyers find the courage to act.\nThey enlisted a lawyer from 50 miles away who seldom practiced in DeLapp\u2019s courtroom. And they worked collectively to build a voluminous complaint alleging that DeLapp had unlawfully jailed not just Ludlow but also many dozens of people in the prior two years alone. The complaint also contained an explosive charge: that the judge may have fabricated a court document to justify jailing Ludlow.\nHad DeLapp fought the charges, he risked more than disgrace. If it could be proved that he submitted a forged document to the supreme court, he might land in prison.\nInstead, DeLapp, 53, struck a deal. He resigned and agreed never again to seek office as a judge. The case against him was dismissed. His state pension and law license remained intact. And DeLapp received a written assurance that neither his departure nor the settlement constituted an admission to the \u201cvalidity of any of the allegations.\u201d\nIn leaving the bench, DeLapp became one of at least 341 judges across the United States to escape punishment or further investigation in the past dozen years by resigning or retiring amid misconduct allegations, Reuters found.\nDeLapp, who is still practicing law in Bartlesville, declined to comment. In court documents, his attorney said the former judge denies any wrongdoing.\nThe DeLapp case shines a light on one of the most opaque and dormant judicial disciplinary systems in America. In Oklahoma, repercussions for wrongdoing have been so unlikely that judges could behave with impunity.\nAlthough each U.S. state has a judicial oversight agency to screen and investigate misconduct complaints, their powers are often limited. In most states, the ultimate disciplinary authority over a judge rests with other judges.\nIn Oklahoma, the chief justice wields enormous discretion over judicial misconduct cases. After the state\u2019s Council on Judicial Complaints completes a confidential investigation of a complaint about a judge, the chief justice has the power to handle discipline privately \u2013 except in rare cases serious enough to justify removing the accused judge from the bench.\nDuring their tenures, two former state supreme court chief justices told Reuters, about one or two wayward judges a year were quietly summoned to the supreme court. There, they received a tongue-lashing behind the closed doors of the chief justice\u2019s chambers. No official record was kept of those meetings, the justices said.\nAs former Chief Justice Joseph Watt put it: \u201cI\u2019d much rather woodshed my brethren in private and not in public.\u201d He added: \u201cHow does that judge feel, knowing he\u2019s being taken to the woodshed in front of God and everybody?\u201d\nConfidential justice for judges is common in America. At least 38 states \u2013 Oklahoma among them \u2013 issue private sanctions when judges misbehave. The name of the judge remains secret, and most of these states keep from the public details of the transgression and the discipline. At a minimum, most states release summary statistics of how many judges are privately disciplined each year. Oklahoma doesn\u2019t make that information public.\nThis practice \u2013 law professor Stephen Gillers calls it \u201cjudges judging judges\u201d \u2013 undermines the system\u2019s ability to prevent misconduct on the bench.\nGillers said the killing of George Floyd, the Black man who died in May under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer, has fueled concerns about how judicial misconduct is handled, too. \u201cThe public has been alerted as it never has been before to the way police misconduct is concealed,\u201d said Gillers. \u201cThe same is true for judges.\u201d\nWhen judges are the ones evaluating misconduct by other judges, they \u201ctend to be more sympathetic, more understanding, more forgiving\u201d to their own, said Gillers, a scholar on judicial ethics who teaches at New York University.\nPrivacy also robs the system of a deterrent effect: Concealing the punishment fails to discourage bad conduct by other judges, who may never learn of the consequences, Gillers and other ethicists say.\nThat\u2019s precisely the dynamic that played out in Oklahoma, local lawyers say. Until Chief Justice Douglas Combs petitioned for DeLapp\u2019s removal, Oklahoma hadn\u2019t publicly filed misconduct charges against a judge in 14 years \u2013 the longest stretch of inaction of any state in recent decades.\nIn its investigation into judicial misconduct across America, Reuters sought to quantify the personal toll inflicted by judges who break the law or violate their sworn oaths. Over a dozen years, Reuters found at least 5,206 people who were directly affected by a judge\u2019s misconduct. The victims ranged from individuals who were subjected to racist, sexist and other abusive comments from judges to those illegally jailed.\n\u201cThis is a broken system that absolutely empowered judges like DeLapp to operate with impunity,\u201d said Josh Lee, the out-of-town attorney who led the effort to rein in DeLapp. \u201cFor more than a decade, not a single judge was publicly disciplined. What kind of message does that send?\u201d Lee said that DeLapp \u201chad no reason to fear that anyone would stop him.\u201d\nMASKING MISCONDUCT\nThe state of Washington is among a dozen states that handle judicial discipline more openly.\nIn 1989, Washington voters abolished the practice of private sanctions. Since then, every case brought against a judge by the Washington judicial conduct commission is made public. Reiko Callner, the commission\u2019s executive director, said judges should be treated the same as anyone who appears before them.\n\u201cThe norm is that anything that happens in a court has the name of the participants on it \u2013 the names of a criminal defendant, the crime victim, people involved in a lawsuit,\u201d Callner said. \u201cWhy should a judge who has been found to have violated the code that governs their conduct be allowed to keep that fact from the public?\u201d\nMany state commissions say there are sound reasons to discipline judges privately. \u201cIt\u2019s quick, it\u2019s inexpensive and you don\u2019t have to hold a public hearing,\u201d said Cynthia Gray, director of the Center for Judicial Ethics at the National Center for State Courts, an independent nonprofit research and training organization.\nOften, Gray said, states see benefits to keeping matters confidential. \u201cIf it\u2019s one-time, minor misconduct by a judge, and the judge shows remorse, you can issue a private sanction or letter and then move on,\u201d she said. That means commissions can focus \u201con the judges who are out there committing patterns of misconduct and are fighting every step of the way.\u201d\nStill, a Reuters investigation found that private discipline has been used to mask significant violations of the law. For example, in 2018, state records show, a Texas judge failed to \u201cmaintain professional competence\u201d and illegally jailed indigent defendants. And in 2017, a California judge engaged in sexual harassment and showed a \u201clack of candor\u201d when accused of misconduct, records show. Neither their names nor their punishments have been made public.\nRELATED COVERAGE\nTeflon Robe: 6 takeaways from Reuters' investigation of misconduct by U.S. judges\nHow Reuters examined misconduct by state and local judges across America\nIn Colorado, the judicial commission has publicly disciplined four judges since 2008 but has privately sanctioned 52. Among those whose names and other identifying information remain hidden from the public: judges disciplined for sexual harassment, for drunken driving, for delayed rulings, and for demonstrating a \u201cpattern of errors in handling trials or issuing rulings that indicate a lack of competence.\u201d\nGranting anonymity to rogue judges is routine.\nA Reuters examination of judicial misconduct nationally identified 3,613 cases from 2008 through 2018 in which states disciplined judges in private, withholding from the public details of their offenses \u2013 including the identities of the judges themselves.\nOver the same period, 26 state oversight councils resolved more judicial misconduct cases privately than publicly, the news agency found. In Massachusetts, for instance, reviews of judicial conduct commission annual reports show that about 9 in 10 judges disciplined were privately sanctioned.\nSome judicial oversight agencies take their independence and secrecy to extremes.\nCalifornia\u2019s oversight agency went to court to try to prevent an audit of its records, a review that ultimately discovered sloppy investigations of judges. In Illinois, the agency misplaced or lost hundreds of complaints, which have not been recovered or investigated.\nKathy Twine, who directs the Illinois Judicial Inquiry Board, declined to comment on the lost files. Twine also would not provide routine complaint and investigation statistics to Reuters \u2013 statistics disclosed to the news agency by almost every other state.\u201cWe\u2019re like an island,\u201d the official said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to disclose anything.\u201d\nA comparison between Oklahoma and a state of similar size highlights the discrepancies in how judges are treated.\nFrom mid-2004 to mid-2018, Oklahoma did not file misconduct charges against any of its 600 judges, Reuters found. By contrast, the state of Mississippi \u2013 with virtually the same code of judicial conduct and almost the same number of judges \u2013 publicly sanctioned 75 judges in the same period.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure every state would like to think it has a judiciary that is above reproach, but every profession\u2019s going to have a few bad apples,\u201d said Darlene Ballard, who retired last week as director of the Mississippi commission. \u201cIt sounds like other states like to keep their problems in-house so that it appears to the public that they don\u2019t have any bad judges.\u201d\nSteve Scheckman, who investigated misconduct cases in Louisiana and New York, said states that report so few cases are failing in their primary mission: to defend, before the public, the integrity of the justice system.\n\u201cTo think that there\u2019s no misconduct in your state, you\u2019re either really naive, in denial or protecting people,\u201d he said.\nFormer Oklahoma Justice Steven Taylor disputes such characterizations. Taylor, who served on the state\u2019s top court from 2004 through 2016, said he was proud that the state had so few cases of public discipline. To him, the small number of cases doesn\u2019t demonstrate weak oversight. It shows \u201ca judiciary in Oklahoma that is ethical, doing their work and highly disciplined.\u201d\n\u201cIf we had 6o or 70 cases, I would be ashamed or embarrassed,\u201d Taylor said.\nAs chief justice in 2011 and 2012, Taylor recalled, he visited the Washington County courthouse in Bartlesville, where he met Judge DeLapp and others. Taylor said no one mentioned any concerns about how DeLapp ran his courtroom.\nBut Reuters identified scores of contempt charges issued by DeLapp in traffic and other cases before, during and after Taylor\u2019s time leading the bench. Some dated back a decade. In 2008, for instance, DeLapp charged a defendant with contempt for \u201cbeing vocal\u201d after the man protested because he had \u201cno money to pay towards his fines & court costs,\u201d according to a court record.\nTaylor said he was \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d when he heard in 2018 that DeLapp had acted so inappropriately for so many years. He also was surprised that lawyers had remained silent for so long.\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t someone report this?\u201d the former justice asked.\nThe local lawyers who kept quiet for years offer a simple answer, rooted in the state\u2019s desire to keep judicial misconduct secret: An unchecked judge has the ability to cow his community.\nIn Bartlesville, the Washington County seat, four judges hear criminal and civil cases, with traffic infractions representing the bulk. The city of 36,000 is an hour north of Tulsa. The courthouse is convenient for visitors, who park for free just steps from the entrance. It also is an easy place for a judge to escape scrutiny.\nThat\u2019s because in Washington County and thousands of other courtrooms nationally, there is no requirement to record or transcribe most proceedings. Employing a stenographer or recording the proceedings is considered too expensive and largely unnecessary for the assembly-line pace of misdemeanor cases that make up most of the court\u2019s business.\nThis lack of an official and detailed record posed an obstacle to the local attorneys alarmed by DeLapp\u2019s behavior. Absent transcripts or recordings to corroborate their concerns, six lawyers told Reuters, they worried that a complaint alleging misconduct would come down to their word against the judge\u2019s.\nThe local lawyers say they felt vulnerable to reprisal. DeLapp wielded authority to appoint attorneys to cases involving indigent defendants. They say the per diem pay for this work made the difference for some lawyers between insolvency and eking out a living.\nThat explanation bothers Taylor, the former state high court justice. \u201cIt\u2019s sad that the lawyers were intimidated,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cPart of the hallmark of being a lawyer is speaking truth to power. They should have spoken up.\u201d\nBut many of those lawyers say they weren\u2019t simply concerned about themselves. They worried that, if DeLapp got wind of a complaint, he might take it out on defendants as well. \u201cIt\u2019s not just your livelihood at stake. It\u2019s also clients,\u201d said defense attorney Marty Meason, who practiced before DeLapp and once ran unsuccessfully against him for district judge. \u201cNobody wanted to take on the system.\u201d\nThat changed in early 2018, when DeLapp ordered Randa Ludlow jailed for five months and 27 days in jail. Her alleged offense: talking during court with her boyfriend, a traffic defendant. Ludlow declined to comment.\nThe sentence seemed outlandish to Meason and other lawyers who had questioned DeLapp\u2019s behavior for years. They suspected DeLapp broke the law by failing to afford Ludlow a hearing to challenge the contempt order, violating a basic constitutional right. They also believed he\u2019d failed to properly document his reasons for jailing her. Whether DeLapp followed proper procedure in punishing Ludlow would become a key component in the misconduct complaint against him.\nA few days after Ludlow was jailed, the lawyers decided to reach out to Lee, an attorney whose office was about an hour\u2019s drive from Bartlesville \u2013 and thus had less to fear because he didn\u2019t regularly appear before DeLapp.\nLee remembers the call his firm received from a Washington County lawyer. The message was clear: You have to help us stop this judge.\n\u201cEveryone feared retaliation,\u201d Lee said. \u201cI worked far enough away that I might be safe. Plus, I was the only one crazy enough to do it.\u201d\nSlideshow ( 4 images )\nA DISPUTED DOCUMENT\nAbout seven weeks after DeLapp had jailed Ludlow for contempt, Lee sought her release by filing a writ of habeas corpus with the state supreme court challenging her detention. The high court quickly heard the case in Oklahoma City.\nAt the hearing, DeLapp told the court that he had been unable to locate the specific document legally necessary to jail Ludlow. In the document, called a Contempt Court Minute, judges must lay out the rationale for the order. The document must also be time stamped and signed.\nShortly after the supreme court hearing, DeLapp notified the high court that he had located the missing record. Nonetheless, the high court voided DeLapp\u2019s contempt order, and Ludlow was immediately released.\nThe case as it related to Ludlow was over. But now, Lee had grown suspicious of DeLapp, in particular the judge\u2019s claim that he had so quickly located the missing Contempt Court Minute he used to justify jailing Ludlow. When DeLapp produced the missing Contempt Court Minute, the document seemed odd, Lee recalled.\nIt included a stamp that made no sense. It was dated two days before DeLapp claimed to have created the document. In other words, it appeared to be backdated, and poorly at that.\nLee wondered: Had DeLapp fabricated the document because one had never been filed in the first place? In late March, Lee received a call from Meason, the Bartlesville attorney who was quietly helping him build a misconduct case against DeLapp and harbored similar suspicions.\n\u201cI found the evidence,\u201d Meason recalled telling Lee. \u201cWe\u2019ve got him.\u201d\nDeLapp, Meason explained, had often used security cameras to monitor the conduct of people in the courthouse. He had used footage from one camera to identify the sloppy sunflower-seed eater.\nThere was also a security camera in the clerk\u2019s office. Playing a hunch, Meason went to the sheriff\u2019s office and requested a copy of weeks of video beginning in February 2018. To his surprise, he said, a staffer quickly handed over the footage on a flash drive.\nReuters reviewed the video, which has never been made public. It shows DeLapp leaving the clerk\u2019s office with files. A clerk then leaves her desk. She returns later with what appears to be a single-page document. The clerk examines the page, then stamps it in two places.\nMeason and Lee say they were convinced that the document shown on the security tape was the same Contempt Court Minute that DeLapp submitted later that day to the high court. The footage, they believe, showed the clerk backdating the document, apparently to make it look as though it had been filed at the time DeLapp issued his contempt order.\nLee submitted a 44-page complaint against DeLapp with the state judicial council, characterizing the contempt document as \u201csuspect at best.\u201d Meason mailed a copy of the unabridged footage to the oversight council. Lee captured key frames and created a video presentation, which he also submitted. \u201cI wanted to make it simple for them,\u201d Lee said.\nThe state\u2019s judicial council investigated Lee\u2019s complaint about DeLapp. According to council director Taylor Henderson, the matter was then forwarded to Chief Justice Combs with a recommendation that DeLapp be removed from office. The council director declined further comment but records show that a short while later, Combs moved to oust DeLapp, publicly filing a 20-page petition with the Court of Judiciary, the nine-member tribunal that has the authority to remove judges.\nIn the petition, the chief justice accused DeLapp of \u201cgross neglect of duty,\u201d \u201coppression in office\u201d and \u201ccomplete disregard\u201d for the law. The justice also criticized DeLapp for abusing his judicial power and declared him unfit for office.\nIn a section titled \u201cFalsified Court Documents and Misrepresentation,\u201d Combs chastised DeLapp for \u201cgross misrepresentation\u201d of the contempt of court document. If DeLapp created the document and pretended it was \u201cnewly discovered,\u201d it may have constituted \u201ca grossly intentional misrepresentation to the Oklahoma Supreme Court\u201d \u2013 one that could be construed as a felony.\nThis was not the first time that DeLapp had failed to properly file a contempt of court document, then produced it after the fact, Combs concluded. In the 2015 case of a woman jailed for eating sunflower seeds in court, DeLapp waited more than two years before he \u201cdrafted\u201d a required sentencing order. DeLapp filed the missing document \u201conly after\u201d his misuse of contempt powers came to light in 2018 in the Ludlow case, Combs wrote.\nCombs detailed more allegations against DeLapp. One involved a father and son who became lost in the hallway of DeLapp\u2019s courthouse. The boy asked DeLapp for directions to another courtroom, and the judge yelled at him, according to witnesses. DeLapp threatened that if the boy couldn\u2019t find his way, \u201che could sit his ass in jail,\u201d Combs wrote.\nAnd the chief justice cited evidence that DeLapp had inappropriately contacted the county attorney\u2019s office about a deferred prosecution agreement for DeLapp\u2019s son, who was charged with traffic violations.\nRather than fight the misconduct allegations, DeLapp resigned without admitting to any wrongdoing.\nNot every state is forgiving of judges facing misconduct charges who opt to resign. California, Texas and a dozen other states have pursued disciplinary cases and impose sanctions even after judges leave the bench.\nWest Virginia is among them. On average, West Virginia disciplines about four or five judges each year. Often, one or two of these cases involves a judge who resigned during a misconduct investigation, said Teresa Tarr, counsel for the state\u2019s judicial oversight commission.\n\u201cIt would be very easy for us to dismiss cases if they resign,\u201d Tarr said. \u201cI think the right thing to do is to hold them accountable, because it gives the public the understanding that the judiciary as a whole is not going to tolerate misbehavior. It also lets the other judges know what\u2019s acceptable conduct and what\u2019s not.\u201d\nNot so in Oklahoma, where the focus is on protecting the judge, not informing the public. \u201cWe want to try to self-police,\u201d said Watt, the former chief justice. Handling matters informally is \u201cthe best way to take care of\u201d wayward judges, \u201cand not drag them through the mud.\u201d\nSettlement agreements like the one Oklahoma approved for DeLapp do more than permit accused judges to walk away without admitting guilt. When an accused judge leaves the bench, the commission\u2019s investigation into misdeeds ends \u2013 even if other wrongdoing is suspected.\nBecause state judicial investigations are sealed, the public is left to wonder about a judge\u2019s culpability. Potential victims of misconduct may go undiscovered. And commission officials are prohibited from discussing cases under penalty of law. That silence can empower an accused judge to declare his or her innocence without citizens ever knowing the facts of the case.\nDeLapp resigned to preserve his livelihood, his wife posted on Facebook. \u201cHe could\u2019ve fought it, which he wanted too [sic] but did not want to risk losing his retirement, pension, Bar license, etc.,\u201d she wrote.\nIn one of his last acts as a judge, DeLapp issued a statement in which he praised his judicial accomplishments and said he was leaving the bench with \u201ca heavy heart but clear conscience.\u201d\nReporting By Michael Berens and John Shiffman.

REUTERS/Rodi Said/File Photo\nAny major disruptions to Syria\u2019s bread subsidy system could undermine the government and threaten a population highly dependent on wheat as rampant inflation drives up food prices.\n\u201cThere is already some evidence of people cutting out meals,\u201d said Mike Robson, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization\u2019s Syria representative.\n\u201c...If the currency continues under pressure, imports will be difficult to obtain and the months leading up to the 2021 wheat harvest may see real shortages.\u201d\nSyria\u2019s economy is collapsing under the weight of its complex, multi-sided conflict, now in its tenth year, and a financial crisis in neighbouring Lebanon, choking off a vital source of dollars.\nSoaring prices have made life harder for Syrians ravaged by a war that has killed hundreds of thousands and displaced millions.\nIn the past six months alone, the number of \u201cfood insecure\u201d people in Syria is estimated to have risen from 7.9 million to 9.3 million, according to World Food Programme data.\n\u201cMy 50,000 pound (monthly) salary ($21 on the informal market) is barely enough for a few days and I am living on debt. People are selling their furniture... In our lives this has never happened,\u201d said state employee Yara.\nThe United States in June imposed its most sweeping sanctions on Syria yet. Washington says the Caesar Act excludes humanitarian aid and aims to hold Assad and his government accountable for war crimes.\nSyrian authorities blame Western sanctions for widespread hardship among ordinary citizens.\nThe Syrian pound, which held steady at around 500 to the dollar for several years, went into free fall last year, hitting a low of 3,000 in June, in anticipation of fresh sanctions.\nThat currency drop is hindering Assad\u2019s plans for buying up all of this year\u2019s wheat to make up for a shortfall in imports that is drawing down on strategic reserves.\nBefore the war, Syria could boast more than a year of wheat reserves.\nThe government declined to answer questions on the current size of reserves and wheat procurement. FAO\u2019s Robson said he did not have data.\nAbdullah, a confectionary trader from Damascus, has never seen poverty on this scale.\n\u201cWe had always been self-sufficient. Why we have reached this point where even a loaf will soon become a dream, I really don\u2019t know,\u201d he told Reuters in a text.\nBREAD POLITICS\nAssad has regained control of much of the country from rebels, with backing from Russia and Iran. But the main wheat regions remain in the hands of Kurdish-led fighters who seized vast territory from Islamic State.\nSyria has had drastically lower output since the conflict erupted. It used to produce 4 million tonnes in a good year and was able to export 1.5 million tonnes.\nThis year, Syria is estimated by the FAO to have produced between 2.1 million and 2.4 million tonnes. The government expects to have produced 2.8 million tonnes.\nDemand across the country is around 4 million tonnes, leaving a shortfall to fill from abroad.\nBut international import tenders conducted by the state\u2019s main grain buyer, Hoboob, have repeatedly failed since last year. The government declined to comment on how many deals it managed to conclude.\nWhile food is not restricted by Western sanctions, banking restrictions and asset freezes have made it difficult for most trading houses to do business with Syria.\nWith major grain traders out of the equation, the government relied on businessmen to conclude transactions to sustain the bread subsidies.\n\u201cThey import quantities to Lebanon and then take it to Syria by land unless it is Russia giving direct shipments, government to government, then they can deliver to (the port of) Latakia,\u201d said Ayman Abdel Nour, a U.S.-based political analyst.\n\u201cNow that window has closed with the problems in Lebanon.\u201d\nReuters data shows that since June 2019, Hoboob has issued at least 10 international tenders for between 100,000 and 200,000 tonnes of wheat, failing to report results for most.\nYoussef Kassem, the head of Hoboob, has been quoted by media as stating that 1.2 million tonnes of Russian wheat imports were contracted throughout 2019 amounting to $310 million. Reuters could not independently verify that information.\nHoboob tried to barter some of Syria\u2019s durum wheat, used in making pasta, for soft bread-making wheat twice in September 2019, with no result announced.\nWhen bread lines started to get longer in government-held areas around March, Russia was urged to send the full amount of the 100,000 tonnes of wheat it had promised as humanitarian aid since 2019.\n\u201cMaybe for the first time since the start of the Syrian uprising, you basically had a shortage of subsidised bread in ovens and that led to the development of a thriving black market,\u201d Elizabeth Tsurkov, Fellow at the U.S.-based Foreign Policy Research Institute think tank and a Syria expert, said.\nRussia, the world\u2019s largest wheat exporter, has been a steady supplier of wheat to Syria but the size of its wheat aid has not met demand.\nRussian customs data does not show supplies to Syria, and the size of real supplies varies wildly.\n\u201cThe supplies are going on. There are however, problems with the payment and availability of vessels ready to deliver to this destination,\u201d a Russian industry source told Reuters.\nThe source estimated only about 150,000 tonnes of commercial wheat had reached Syria between July 2019 and May 2020.\nA RACE FOR RESERVES\nThe government blamed bread lines on technicalities and with the start of its wheat buying season in June announced it would buy every single grain of its local crop.\nBy mid-June, Hoboob said it had so far procured around 212,000 tonnes. FAO estimates that around 700,000 tonnes of the total crop lie in government-controlled territory this year.\nBut the three provinces which account for over 70 percent of production lie mostly in the hands of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), led by the Kurdish YPG militia.\nThe government has historically lured farmers to sell their crop by paying a higher price than its rivals, even as the wheat remained in areas outside its control.\nThis year, with the collapse of the pound, it has upped its price from the 225 pounds a kilo announced at the beginning of the season to 425 pounds.\nBut facing a currency crash and in fear of a ripple effect from Caesar sanctions on the economy of the areas they control, the Kurdish-led authority not only raised its local wheat purchasing price but also pegged it to the going rate of the dollar, pledging to pay 17 U.S. cents a kilo no matter how far the pound slips.\nSalman Barodo, head of the region\u2019s economy and agriculture board, said so far 400,000 tonnes had been bought and warned against any attempts to smuggle the crop outwards.\nThe Kurdish-led authority, that runs the SDF region, is aiming to stockpile 18 months\u2019 worth of supply and only open sales to government territories in the case of a surplus.\nReporting By Maha El Dahan in Dubai and Ellen Francis in Beirut; additional reporting by Suleiman Al Khalidi in Amman and Polina Devitt in Moscow; Editing by Michael Georgy and Nick Macfie\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"url": "/article/idUSL8N2EG0K0", "headline": "Kenyan Museum, Mau Mau fighter shed light on British colonial abuses", "published_date": "2020-07-09", "text": "By Katharine Houreld\n3 MIN READ\nNAIROBI, July 9 (Reuters) - Nearing 100, Gitu Wa Kahengeri clearly remembers the day when, as a prisoner of Kenya\u2019s colonial occupier Britain, he wanted to die.\n\u201cI was beaten the whole day until I did not feel pain any longer,\u201d he said, of one episode of abuse during the seven years he spent in the camps that the British ran in the decade before Kenyan independence in 1963.\nThe camps, where tens of thousands are thought to have died, are a traumatic but largely forgotten part of Kenya\u2019s past.\nThey were set up to jail activists and sympathisers during the Mau-Mau uprising of 1952-1960, in which Kahengeri, born in the 1920s and a Secretary General of the independence movement\u2019s Veterans Association, participated.\nUsing eye-witness accounts, documents and field visits, Kenyan and British historians from the Museum of British Colonialism are now building an online archive of the period, complete with 3D recreations of some of the camps.\nThey include 27-year-old Chao Tayiana Maina.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been through the public education system ... and not once do I remember hearing about detention camps,\u201d she told Reuters. \u201cThere was a sense of betrayal.

The PAP\u2019s Vivian Balakrishnan shot back saying the local PMET workforce was nearly seven times larger than the foreign PMET workforce, that it was growing, and that recent job losses had fallen most heavily on foreigners.\n\u201cWhat more do you want us to do?,\u201d Balakrishnan, the foreign minister, asked.\nWhen similar issues flared during the 2011 election, the PAP polled a record-low 60% of the vote and tightened international hiring rules to address voters\u2019 sensitivities.\n\u201cFor me and my friends, one of our top concerns are employment opportunities,\u201d said, Xuan Na a 21-year-old student about to enter her final year. \u201cWe are worried that we won\u2019t be able to land a proper job.\u201d\nReporting by Tom Westbrook, Aradhana Aravindan and Joseph Campbell; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"url": "/article/idUSKBN2480UI", "headline": "U.S. women's league dedicates season to social justice", "published_date": "2020-07-07", "text": "By Reuters Staff\n2 MIN READ\nFILE PHOTO: Cathy Engelbert speaks at the 2017 Fortune magazine's Most Powerful Women summit in Washington, U.S., October 9, 2017.

The City has an obligation to protect their safety and essential services,\u201d she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in emailed comments.\nThe police action comes one day after city workers removed some barricades in response to a class action lawsuit by residents and business owners, fueling the debate over how to balance the right of peaceful assembly with the protection of property rights.\n\u2018UNPRECEDENTED DECISION\u2019\nFueled by chants of \u201cWhose streets? Our streets!\u201d, activists have led roving marches throughout Washington state\u2019s largest city for more than a month since the death of George Floyd, a Black man killed in Minneapolis police custody, sparked worldwide protests against racism.\nProtesters had been occupying several blocks in Capitol Hill since June 8, when police vacated their East Precinct station and moved street barricades to section off the area, dubbing it the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone.\nMayor Durkan\u2019s office said in a statement the aim of the move was to reduce tensions following a week of violent clashes between protesters and police.\nAbout 500 demonstrators created a makeshift camp behind the barricades, covering the abandoned precinct in graffiti which included a banner declaring \u201cThis space is now property of the Seattle people\u201d.\nThe occupation, now known as the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest (CHOP), started off largely festive.\nArtists painted murals commemorating Black lives, outdoor screenings showed documentaries about race, activists gave speeches on police brutality, and protesters and passersby converged at a \u201cconversation cafe\u201d.\nWhile the city provided portable bathrooms and trash pick-up, protesters insisted that police stay away.\nBut following four nights of gun violence since June 20 that left two Black teenagers dead and several injured, the mood has soured.\nNeighboring residents and business owners lament the lack of reliable police service, with some resorting to hiring private security, according to security firm Iconic Global.\nThey say their property rights have been infringed upon as their vehicles must navigate the barricades managed by the whims of protester volunteers, according to a class action lawsuit attorneys filed against the City of Seattle last month.\nNeighborhood businesses, residents and homeowners\u2019 associations highlighted the city\u2019s \u201cunprecedented decision to abandon and close off an entire city neighborhood, leaving it unchecked by the police, unserved by fire and emergency health services, and inaccessible to the public at large.\u201d\nThe lawsuit goes on to say that \u201cthe City\u2019s decision has subjected businesses, employees, and residents of that neighborhood to extensive property damage, public safety dangers, and an inability to use and access their properties.\u201d\nIn response to the lawsuit, this week city workers removed three of six concrete barriers that had been installed to improve traffic flow and ensure protester safety.\nProtesters quickly replaced the barricades with things like couches, plywood and signs.\nFRAGILE RELATIONSHIPS\nLawrence Yeh\u2019s sushi restaurant Momiji sits directly across the street from the precinct. He said the occupation has had little impact on his business.\nDespite the constantly changing barricade configuration, his deliveries have been arriving \u201c99% of the time\u201d and customers have come on foot unfettered, Yeh said.\n\u201cWe have a pretty good relationship with the protesters,\u201d Yeh added. \u201cIt varies block to block.\u201d\nOne block over, apartment dweller J. Cam Manny said his relationship with protesters has deteriorated.\nAfter attending daily meetings in the early days of the protest where activists tried to figure out their next steps, Manny said he has since been physically assaulted and threatened by protesters who chased him from his home.\nHe shared photos with the Thomson Reuters Foundation of vulgar messages directed at him by name spray painted on the sidewalk in front of his apartment building.\n\u201cI\u2019m now a CHOP refugee,\u201d he said, adding he was staying with his dog sitter in another neighbourhood and planned to wait a few days before returning home.\nOne protester who gave his name as Daniel P. disputed any bad blood between protesters and residents.\n\u201cWe have worked with every resident that has actually bothered to have communications with us,\u201d he said.\n\u201cEvery time when we have been asked to open up (the barricades), we have. We have done nothing but be respectful. We helped protect property when the cops didn\u2019t show up. We have done what the city departments would not do,\u201d he said.\nBALANCING RIGHTS\nThe tide gradually turned against the protesters, with even once-sympathetic voices calling for the area to be cleared.\n\u201cThe community initially embraced the CHOP as an alternative to police violence, joining in the call for change, a change we still demand,\u201d said Community Roots Housing and Capitol Hill EcoDistrict in an open letter.\nCommunity Roots is a neighborhood non-profit affordable housing developer whose properties near CHOP are home to nearly 700 low-income residents.\n\u201cBut what\u2019s happening in the area now has little to do with the movement for Black lives,\u201d the letter continued.\n\u201cMost of the activists have moved on. The park has become an encampment, our residents have been threatened and chased and businesses are being hurt.\u201d\nThe city has promised to preserve aspects of CHOP\u2019s legacy, like artwork, a Black Lives Matter street mural and a community garden.\nReporting by Gregory Scruggs, Editing by Jumana Farouky and Zoe Tabary.

Colorado and Utah primarily vote by mail, minimizing the problems with in-person voting that marred other elections during the coronavirus outbreak.\nHickenlooper, recruited to run by national Democrats after his failed presidential campaign last year, had been expected to coast to victory in Colorado but he was beset down the stretch by ethical violations and campaign gaffes, raising some doubts.\nHe acknowledged he misspoke in late May when he said during a discussion of the \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d movement that every life matters - a phrase criticized for dismissing racism against Black people. He also apologized after a six-year-old quip surfaced in which he compared a politician\u2019s schedule to working on a slave ship.\nHickenlooper was fined $2,750 by the Colorado Independent Ethics Commission on June 12 for violating state ethics laws by accepting free travel when he was governor. He initially defied a subpoena from the panel, testifying only after he was found in contempt.\nRepublicans said Hickenlooper\u2019s late stumbles showed he would be vulnerable against Gardner.\n\u201cIf watching him fall apart under pressure these last few weeks is any indication, \u2018hot mess\u2019 Hickenlooper is in for a very bumpy ride,\u201d said Joanna Rodriguez, a spokeswoman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee.\nDemocrats also learned the winner on Tuesday in the race for the U.S. Senate nomination in Kentucky, where the results were delayed a week by the counting of mailed ballots. Establishment-backed Amy McGrath held off a late surge by Black state lawmaker Charles Booker for the right to challenge Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell.\nIn Colorado, U.S. Representative Scott Tipton, who had been endorsed by Trump, was upset in a Republican primary by gun rights activist Lauren Boebert. She runs a gun-themed restaurant and has spoken favorably about the pro-Trump conspiracy theory QAnon, which says \u201cdeep-state\u201d traitors are plotting against the president.\nRepublicans were choosing challengers to run against U.S. Representatives Kendra Horn of Oklahoma and Ben McAdams of Utah, two endangered Democrats who represent districts that Trump carried in 2016.\nIn Oklahoma, the winner will be determined in an Aug. 25 runoff as no candidate managed 50% of the vote. In Utah, former National Football League player Burgess Owens won the Republican primary to take on McAdams.\nA ballot measure in Oklahoma to expand Medicaid, the government healthcare program for the poor and disabled, appeared to narrowly win despite the Republican governor\u2019s arguments the state cannot afford it.

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson/File Photo\nHickenlooper\u2019s victory sets up a high-profile Nov. 3 showdown with conservative Republican U.S. Senator Cory Gardner, considered one of the country\u2019s most vulnerable incumbents and a top target for Democrats.\nWith more than three-quarters of precincts reporting, Hickenlooper led by nearly 20 percentage points over Andrew Romanoff, a former Colorado House speaker who had touted progressive priorities such as Medicare for All that were opposed by the more moderate Hickenlooper.\nAfter his win, Hickenlooper made it clear in a video address to supporters that he would tie Gardner, who has been closely aligned with Republican President Donald Trump, directly to what he said were Trump\u2019s failed policies.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never lost an election in this state and I don\u2019t intend to lose this one,\u201d Hickenlooper said.\nColorado was one of three states, along with Utah and Oklahoma, to hold nominating contests on Tuesday. Colorado and Utah primarily vote by mail, minimizing the problems with in-person voting that marred other elections during the coronavirus outbreak.\nHickenlooper, recruited to run by national Democrats after his failed presidential campaign last year, had been expected to coast to victory in Colorado but he was beset down the stretch by ethical violations and campaign gaffes, raising some doubts.\nHe acknowledged he misspoke in late May when he said during a discussion of the \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d movement that every life matters - a phrase criticized for dismissing racism against Black people. He also apologized after a six-year-old quip surfaced in which he compared a politician\u2019s schedule to working on a slave ship.\nHickenlooper was fined $2,750 by the Colorado Independent Ethics Commission on June 12 for violating state ethics laws by accepting free travel when he was governor. He initially defied a subpoena from the panel, testifying only after he was found in contempt.\nRepublicans said Hickenlooper\u2019s late stumbles showed he would be vulnerable against Gardner.\n\u201cIf watching him fall apart under pressure these last few weeks is any indication, \u2018hot mess\u2019 Hickenlooper is in for a very bumpy ride,\u201d said Joanna Rodriguez, a spokeswoman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee.\nDemocrats also learned the winner on Tuesday in the race for the U.S. Senate nomination in Kentucky, where the results were delayed a week by the counting of mailed ballots. Establishment-backed Amy McGrath held off a late surge by Black state lawmaker Charles Booker for the right to challenge Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell.\nIn Colorado, U.S. Representative Scott Tipton, who had been endorsed by Trump, was upset in a Republican primary by gun rights activist Lauren Boebert. She runs a gun-themed restaurant and has spoken favorably about the pro-Trump conspiracy theory QAnon, which says \u201cdeep-state\u201d traitors are plotting against the president.\nRepublicans were choosing challengers to run against U.S. Representatives Kendra Horn of Oklahoma and Ben McAdams of Utah, two endangered Democrats who represent districts that Trump carried in 2016.\nIn Oklahoma, the winner will be determined in an Aug. 25 runoff as no candidate managed 50% of the vote. In Utah, former National Football League player Burgess Owens won the Republican primary to take on McAdams.\nA ballot measure in Oklahoma to expand Medicaid, the government healthcare program for the poor and disabled, appeared to narrowly win despite the Republican governor\u2019s arguments the state cannot afford it.

That helped stretch the boundaries for what is now permissible in the office, even virtual ones hosted on platforms such as LinkedIn, said Brittany Bronson, a diversity and inclusion consultant for Rebrand Career Consulting.\n\u201cWe have all brought more of our personal lives to work since COVID-19 began \u2013 we\u2019re seeing our colleagues\u2019 kids, dogs, partners, parents,\u201d Lisa Ross, U.S. chief operating officer for consultancy Edelman, told Reuters by email. \u201cIt\u2019s harder and harder for people to hide their views, and I think the open conversation you\u2019re seeing on LinkedIn is part of that.\u201d\nThe day before the Juneteenth holiday, Ross posted: \u201cWith all due respect- I don\u2019t need anyone to give me a holiday...I need pay equity, equal opportunity, and access.\u201d\nThe shift in tone and content has also created a challenge for LinkedIn to balance the need to foster honest and productive expression while maintaining professional decorum, say experts.\nThat played out in LinkedIn\u2019s own backyard in June when it was forced to reverse a policy that once allowed its employees to post anonymously during company meetings to create a \u201csafe space\u201d for opinions after some employees posted \u201coffensive\u201d comments during a company-wide town hall meeting to address diversity.\n\"We require members on our platform to have real identities and we will not allow anonymous questions in all hands meetings in the future,\" LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky wrote in a blog post bit.ly/2ZjjvIt explaining the new policy. \"We are not and will not be a company or platform where racism or hateful speech is allowed.\"\nThe platform\u2019s moderators stepped in again in June when one LinkedIn commenter said a picture of a group of Black Harvard Law students looked like \u201cgang members.\u201d Mo Light, who posted the photo of himself and his classmates, which attracted more than 1.3 million views and 12,000 reactions on LinkedIn, demanded the name caller be held \u201caccountable.\u201d\nIn the comments section of the post, LinkedIn told Light it was investigating the matter. LinkedIn declined to comment on the status of users\u2019 accounts. The commenter\u2019s profile is no longer active.\nIn addition to employing human community moderators, who field complaints from users, LinkedIn also uses artificial intelligence and automated systems to detect and remove inappropriate content to ensure that the platform remains a \u201creal, respectful and professional community,\u201d Li said.\nFor ad exec Davis, who waited 10 years before airing his grievances against his former bosses at McCann Worldgroup for recommending anger management classes when he spoke up at the time, LinkedIn helped bring closure to a painful episode in his career.\nDavis\u2019 former boss Jonathan Shipman, who no longer works for McCann, apologized in the comments of the post. \u201cI have always considered myself a mentor but now is the time for me to be the mentee,\u201d he wrote.\nDavis and Shipman told Reuters they reconnected recently and are now working on a project to boost the exposure of Black professionals to the advertising industry.\nA McCann spokesman declined to comment.\n(This story corrects title of Davis in second paragraph)\nReporting by Arriana McLymore; editing by Kenneth Li and Lisa Shumaker\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"url": "/article/idUSKBN2413FQ", "headline": "A picture and its story: U.S. couple waves guns at anti-racism protesters", "published_date": "2020-06-30", "text": "By Reuters Staff\n4 MIN READ\n(Reuters) - For Reuters photographer Lawrence Bryant, the events of last Sunday in St. Louis, Missouri, will make him especially vigilant the next time he goes out to cover anti-racism protests that are sweeping the United States.\nPatricia McCloskey and her husband Mark McCloskey draw their firearms on protestors, including a man who holds a video camera and microphone, as they enter their neighborhood during a protest against St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson, in St. Louis, Missouri, U.S. June 28, 2020.

In photographs and video footage of the incident, he wore a pink shirt, beige trousers and his feet were bare.\nWith places to take cover, Bryant said he was not overly worried at that point, even when the man appeared to cock his weapon.\nThen Patricia McCloskey appeared from the front of the house holding a handgun. Bryant quickly became more concerned.\n\u201cShe had her finger on the trigger and looked nervous and I became a little bit more worried, as there were kids out there and she was sporadically pointing the gun at random people,\u201d he recalled.\n\u201cI just was trying to make frames.

He made no comment.\nBryant said he was pleased with the pictures he took.\nOn the one hand, he would have liked a longer lens to be able to zoom in on the man and the woman.

The sentence was so stiff it exceeded the jail time Alabama allows for negligent homicide.\nMarquita Johnson poses for a photo on the street where she was arrested at a police road block in Montgomery, Alabama, U.S., September 26, 2019. Picture taken September 26, 2019. REUTERS/Chris Aluka Berry\nMarquita Johnson, who was locked up in April 2012, says the impact of her time in jail endures today. Johnson\u2019s three children were cast into foster care while she was incarcerated. One daughter was molested, state records show. Another was physically abused.\n\u201cJudge Hayes took away my life and didn\u2019t care how my children suffered,\u201d said Johnson, now 36. \u201cMy girls will never be the same.\u201d\nFellow inmates found her sentence hard to believe. \u201cThey had a nickname for me: The Woman with All the Days,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThat\u2019s what they called me: The Woman with All the Days. There were people who had committed real crimes who got out before me.\u201d\nIn 2016, the state agency that oversees judges charged Hayes with violating Alabama\u2019s code of judicial conduct. According to the Judicial Inquiry Commission, Hayes broke state and federal laws by jailing Johnson and hundreds of other Montgomery residents too poor to pay fines. Among those jailed: a plumber struggling to make rent, a mother who skipped meals to cover the medical bills of her disabled son, and a hotel housekeeper working her way through college.\nHayes, a judge since 2000, admitted in court documents to violating 10 different parts of the state\u2019s judicial conduct code. One of the counts was a breach of a judge\u2019s most essential duty: failing to \u201crespect and comply with the law.\u201d\nDespite the severity of the ruling, Hayes wasn\u2019t barred from serving as a judge. Instead, the judicial commission and Hayes reached a deal. The former Eagle Scout would serve an 11-month unpaid suspension. Then he could return to the bench.\nUntil he was disciplined, Hayes said in an interview with Reuters, \u201cI never thought I was doing something wrong.\u201d\nThis week, Hayes is set to retire after 20 years as a judge. In a statement to Reuters, Hayes said he was \u201cvery remorseful\u201d for his misdeeds.\nCommunity activists say his departure is long overdue. Yet the decision to leave, they say, should never have been his to make, given his record of misconduct.\n\u201cHe should have been fired years ago,\u201d said Willie Knight, pastor of North Montgomery Baptist Church. \u201cHe broke the law and wanted to get away with it. His sudden retirement is years too late.\u201d\nHayes is among thousands of state and local judges across America who were allowed to keep positions of extraordinary power and prestige after violating judicial ethics rules or breaking laws they pledged to uphold, a Reuters investigation found.\nJudges have made racist statements, lied to state officials and forced defendants to languish in jail without a lawyer \u2013 and then returned to the bench, sometimes with little more than a rebuke from the state agencies overseeing their conduct.\nRecent media reports have documented failures in judicial oversight in South Carolina, Louisiana and Illinois. Reuters went further.\nIn the first comprehensive accounting of judicial misconduct nationally, Reuters reviewed 1,509 cases from the last dozen years \u2013 2008 through 2019 \u2013 in which judges resigned, retired or were publicly disciplined following accusations of misconduct. In addition, reporters identified another 3,613 cases from 2008 through 2018 in which states disciplined wayward judges but kept hidden from the public key details of their offenses \u2013 including the identities of the judges themselves.\nAll told, 9 of every 10 judges were allowed to return to the bench after they were sanctioned for misconduct, Reuters determined. They included a California judge who had sex in his courthouse chambers, once with his former law intern and separately with an attorney; a New York judge who berated domestic violence victims; and a Maryland judge who, after his arrest for driving drunk, was allowed to return to the bench provided he took a Breathalyzer test before each appearance.\nThe news agency\u2019s findings reveal an \u201cexcessively\u201d forgiving judicial disciplinary system, said Stephen Gillers, a law professor at New York University who writes about judicial ethics. Although punishment short of removal from the bench is appropriate for most misconduct cases, Gillers said, the public \u201cwould be appalled at some of the lenient treatment judges get\u201d for substantial transgressions.\nAmong the cases from the past year alone:\nIn Utah, a judge texted a video of a man\u2019s scrotum to court clerks. He was reprimanded but remains on the bench.\nIn Indiana, three judges attending a conference last spring got drunk and sparked a 3 a.m. brawl outside a White Castle fast-food restaurant that ended with two of the judges shot. Although the state supreme court found the three judges had \u201cdiscredited the entire Indiana judiciary,\u201d each returned to the bench after a suspension.\nIn Texas, a judge burst in on jurors deliberating the case of a woman charged with sex trafficking and declared that God told him the defendant was innocent. The offending judge received a warning and returned to the bench. The defendant was convicted after a new judge took over the case.\n\u201cThere are certain things where there should be a level of zero tolerance,\u201d the jury foreman, Mark House, told Reuters. The judge should have been fined, House said, and kicked off the bench. \u201cThere is no justice, because he is still doing his job.\u201d\nJudicial misconduct specialists say such behavior has the potential to erode trust in America\u2019s courts and, absent tough consequences, could give judges license to behave with impunity.\n\u201cWhen you see cases like that, the public starts to wonder about the integrity and honesty of the system,\u201d said Steve Scheckman, a lawyer who directed Louisiana\u2019s oversight agency and served as deputy director of New York\u2019s. \u201cIt looks like a good ol\u2019 boys club.\u201d\nThat\u2019s how local lawyers viewed the case of a longtime Alabama judge who concurrently served on the state\u2019s judicial oversight commission. The judge, Cullman District Court\u2019s Kim Chaney, remained on the bench for three years after being accused of violating the same nepotism rules he was tasked with enforcing on the oversight commission. In at least 200 cases, court records show, Judge Chaney chose his own son to serve as a court-appointed defense lawyer for the indigent, enabling the younger Chaney to earn at least $105,000 in fees over two years.\nIn February, months after Reuters repeatedly asked Chaney and the state judicial commission about those cases, he retired from the bench as part of a deal with state authorities to end the investigation.\nTommy Drake, the lawyer who first filed a complaint against Chaney in 2016, said he doubts the judge would have been forced from the bench if Reuters hadn\u2019t examined the case.\n\u201cYou know the only reason they did anything about Chaney is because you guys started asking questions,\u201d Drake said. \u201cOtherwise, he\u2019d still be there.\u201d\nBEDROCK OF AMERICAN JUSTICE\nState and local judges draw little scrutiny even though their courtrooms are the bedrock of the American criminal justice system, touching the lives of millions of people every year.\nThe country\u2019s approximately 1,700 federal judges hear 400,000 cases annually. The nearly 30,000 state, county and municipal court judges handle a far bigger docket: more than 100 million new cases each year, from traffic to divorce to murder. Their titles range from justice of the peace to state supreme court justice. Their powers are vast and varied \u2013 from determining whether a defendant should be jailed to deciding who deserves custody of a child.\nEach U.S. state has an oversight agency that investigates misconduct complaints against judges. The authority of the oversight agencies is distinct from the power held by appellate courts, which can reverse a judge\u2019s legal ruling and order a new trial. Judicial commissions cannot change verdicts. Rather, they can investigate complaints about the behavior of judges and pursue discipline ranging from reprimand to removal.\nFew experts dispute that the great majority of judges behave responsibly, respecting the law and those who appear before them. And some contend that, when judges do falter, oversight agencies are effective in identifying and addressing the behavior. \u201cWith a few notable exceptions, the commissions generally get it right,\u201d said Keith Swisher, a University of Arizona law professor who specializes in judicial ethics.\nRELATED COVERAGE\nTeflon Robe: 5 takeaways from Reuters' investigation of misconduct by U.S. judges\nHow Reuters examined misconduct by state and local judges across America\nOthers disagree. They note that the clout of these commissions is limited, and their authority differs from state to state. To remove a judge, all but a handful of states require approval of a panel that includes other judges. And most states seldom exercise the full extent of those disciplinary powers.\nAs a result, the system tends to err on the side of protecting the rights and reputations of judges while overlooking the impact courtroom wrongdoing has on those most affected by it: people like Marquita Johnson.\nReuters scoured thousands of state investigative files, disciplinary proceedings and court records from the past dozen years to quantify the personal toll of judicial misconduct. The examination found at least 5,206 people who were directly affected by a judge\u2019s misconduct. The victims cited in disciplinary documents ranged from people who were illegally jailed to those subjected to racist, sexist and other abusive comments from judges in ways that tainted the cases.\nThe number is a conservative estimate. The tally doesn\u2019t include two previously reported incidents that affected thousands of defendants and prompted sweeping reviews of judicial conduct.\nIn Pennsylvania, the state examined the convictions of more than 3,500 teenagers sentenced by two judges. The judges were convicted of taking kickbacks as part of a scheme to fill a private juvenile detention center. In 2009, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court appointed senior judge Arthur Grim to lead a victim review, and the state later expunged criminal records for 2,251 juveniles. Grim told Reuters that every state should adopt a way to compensate victims of judicial misconduct.\n\u201cIf we have a system that holds a wrongdoer accountable but we fail to address the victims, then we are really losing sight of what a justice system should be all about,\u201d Grim said.\nIn another review underway in Ohio, state public defender Tim Young is scrutinizing 2,707 cases handled by a judge who retired in 2018 after being hospitalized for alcoholism. Mike Benza, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University whose students are helping identify victims, compared the work to current investigations into police abuse of power. \u201cYou see one case and then you look to see if it\u2019s systemic,\u201d he said.\nThe review, which has been limited during the coronavirus pandemic, may take a year. But Young said the time-consuming task is essential because \u201ca fundamental injustice may have been levied against hundreds or thousands of people.\u201d\nSPECIAL RULES FOR JUDGES\nMost states afford judges accused of misconduct a gentle kind of justice. Perhaps no state better illustrates the shortcomings of America\u2019s system for overseeing judges than Alabama.\nAs in most states, Alabama\u2019s nine-member Judicial Inquiry Commission is a mix of lawyers, judges and lay people. All are appointed. Their deliberations are secret and they operate under some of the most judge-friendly rules in the nation.\nAlabama\u2019s rules make even filing a complaint against a judge difficult. The complaint must be notarized, which means that in theory, anyone who makes misstatements about the judge can be prosecuted for perjury. Complaints about wrongdoing must be made in writing; those that arrive by phone, email or without a notary stamp are not investigated, although senders are notified why their complaints have been summarily rejected. Anonymous written complaints are shredded.\nThese rules can leave lawyers and litigants fearing retaliation, commission director Jenny Garrett noted in response to written questions.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a ridiculous system that protects judges and makes it easy for them to intimidate anyone with a legitimate complaint,\u201d said Sue Bell Cobb, chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court from 2007 to 2011. In 2009, she unsuccessfully championed changes to the process and commissioned an American Bar Association report that offered a scathing review of Alabama\u2019s rules.\nIn most other states, commission staff members can start investigating a judge upon receiving a phone call or email, even anonymous ones, or after learning of questionable conduct from a news report or court filing. In Alabama, staff will not begin an investigation without approval from the commission itself, which convenes about every seven weeks.\nBy rule, the commission also must keep a judge who is under scrutiny fully informed throughout an investigation. If a subpoena is issued, the judge receives a simultaneous copy, raising fears about witness intimidation. If a witness gives investigators a statement, the judge receives a transcript. In the U.S. justice system, such deference to individuals under investigation is extremely rare.\n\u201cWhy the need for special rules for judges?\u201d said Michael Levy, a Washington lawyer who has represented clients in high-profile criminal, corporate, congressional and securities investigations. \u201cIf judges think it\u2019s fair and appropriate to investigate others for crimes or misconduct without providing those subjects or targets with copies of witness statements and subpoenas, why don\u2019t judges think it\u2019s fair to investigate judges in the same way?\u201d\nAlabama judges also are given an opportunity to resolve investigations confidentially. Reuters interviews and a review of Alabama commission records show the commission has met with judges informally at least 19 times since 2011 to offer corrective \u201cguidance.\u201d The identities of those judges remain confidential, as does the conduct that prompted the meetings. \u201cNot every violation warrants discipline,\u201d commission director Garrett said.\nSince 2008, the commission has brought 21 public cases against judges, including Hayes, charging two this year.\nTwo of the best-known cases brought by the commission involved Roy Moore, who was twice forced out as chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court for defying federal court orders.\nAnother Alabama justice fared better in challenging a misconduct complaint, however. Tom Parker, first elected to the state\u2019s high court in 2004, pushed back when the commission investigated him in 2015 for comments he made on the radio criticizing the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision legalizing gay marriage.\nParker sued the commission in federal court, arguing the agency was infringing on his First Amendment rights. He won. Although the commission had dropped its investigation before the ruling, it was ordered to cover Parker\u2019s legal fees: $100,000, or about a fifth of the agency\u2019s total annual budget.\nIn 2018, the people of Alabama elected Parker chief justice.\nThese days, Parker told Reuters, Alabama judges and the agency that oversees them enjoy \u201ca much better relationship\u201d that\u2019s less politically tinged. \u201cHow can I say it? It\u2019s much more respectful between the commission and the judges now.\u201d\n\u201cGUT INSTINCT\u201d\nMontgomery, Alabama has a deep history of racial conflict, as reflected in the clashing concepts emblazoned on the city\u2019s great seal: \u201cCradle of the Confederacy\u201d and \u201cBirthplace of the Civil Rights Movement.\u201d\nJefferson Davis was inaugurated here as Confederate president after the South seceded from the Union in 1861, and his birthday is a state holiday. As was common throughout the South, the city was the site of the lynchings of Black men, crimes now commemorated at a national memorial based here. Police arrested civil rights icon Rosa Parks here in 1955 for refusing to give up her seat on a city bus to a white passenger.\nToday, about 60% of Montgomery\u2019s 198,000 residents are Black, U.S. census records show. Even so, Black motorists account for about 90% of those charged with unpaid traffic tickets, a Reuters examination of court records found. Much of Judge Hayes\u2019 work in municipal court involved traffic cases and the collection of fines. Hayes, who is white, told Reuters that \u201cthe majority of people who come before the court are Black.\u201d\nCity officials have said that neither race nor economics have played a role in police efforts to enforce outstanding warrants, no matter how minor the offense.\nIn April 2012, Marquita Johnson was among them. Appearing before Hayes on a Wednesday morning, the 28-year-old single mother pleaded for a break.\nJohnson had struggled for eight years to pay dozens of tickets that began with a citation for failing to show proof of insurance. She had insurance, she said. But when she was pulled over, she couldn\u2019t find the card to prove it.\nEven a single ticket was a knockout blow on her minimum-wage waitress salary. In addition to fines, the court assessed a $155 fee to every ticket. Court records show that police often issued her multiple tickets for other infractions during every stop \u2013 a practice some residents call \u201cstacking.\u201d\nSlideshow ( 7 images )\nUnder state law, failing to pay even one ticket can result in the suspension of a driver\u2019s license. Johnson\u2019s decision to keep driving nonetheless \u2013 taking her children to school or to doctor visits, getting groceries, going to work \u2013 led to more tickets and deeper debt.\n\u201cI told Judge Hayes that I had lost my job and needed more time to pay,\u201d she recounted.\nBy Hayes\u2019 calculation, Johnson owed more than $12,000 in fines. He sentenced Johnson to 496 days in jail. Hayes arrived at that sentence by counting each day in jail as $25 toward the outstanding debt. A different judge later determined that Johnson actually owed half the amount calculated by Hayes, and that Hayes had incorrectly penalized her over fines she had already paid. To shave time off her sentence, Johnson washed police cars and performed other menial labor while jailed.\nHayes told Reuters that he generally found pleas of poverty hard to believe. \u201cWith my years of experience, I can tell when someone is being truthful with me,\u201d Hayes said. He called it \u201cgut instinct\u201d - though he added, in a statement this week, that he also consulted \u201ceach defendant\u2019s criminal and traffic history as well as their history of warrants and failures to appear in court.\u201d\nOf course, the law demands more of a judge than a gut call. In a 1983 landmark decision, Bearden v. Georgia, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that state judges are obligated to hold a hearing to determine whether a defendant has \u201cwillfully\u201d chosen not to pay a fine.\nAccording to the state\u2019s judicial oversight commission, \u201cJudge Hayes did not make any inquiry into Ms. Johnson\u2019s ability to pay, whether her non-payment was willful.\u201d\nFrom jail, \u201cI prayed to return to my daughters,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI was sure that someone would realize that Hayes had made a mistake.\u201d\nShe said her worst day in jail was her youngest daughter\u2019s 3rd birthday. From a jail telephone, she tried to sing \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d but slumped to the floor in grief.\n\u201cShe was choking up and crying,\u201d said Johnson\u2019s mother, Blanche, who was on the call. \u201cShe was devastated to be away from her children so long.\u201d\nWhen Johnson was freed after 10 months in jail, she learned that strangers had abused her two older children. One is now a teenager; the other is in middle school.\n\u201cMy kids will pay a lifetime for what the court system did to me,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cMy daughters get frantic when I leave the house. I know they\u2019ve had nightmares that I\u2019m going to disappear again.\u201d\nSix months after Johnson\u2019s release, Hayes jailed another single Black mother. Angela McCullough, then 40, had been pulled over driving home from Faulkner University, a local community college where she carried a 3.87 grade point average. As a mother of four children, including a disabled adult son, she had returned to college to pursue her dream of becoming a mental health counselor.\nPolice ticketed her for failing to turn on her headlights. After a background check, the officer arrested McCullough on a warrant for outstanding traffic tickets. She was later brought before Hayes.\n\u201cI can\u2019t go to jail,\u201d McCullough recalled pleading with the judge. \u201cI\u2019m a mother. I have a disabled son who needs me.\u201d\nHayes sentenced McCullough to 100 days in jail to pay off a court debt of $1,350, court records show. Her adult son, diagnosed with schizophrenia, was held in an institution until her release.\nMcCullough said she cleaned jail cells in return for time off her sentence. One day, she recalled, she had to clean a blood-soaked cell where a female inmate had slit her wrists.\nShe was freed after 20 days, using the money she saved for tuition to pay off her tickets, she said.\nJail was the darkest chapter of her life, McCullough said, a place where \u201cthe devil was trying to take my mind.\u201d Today, she has abandoned her pursuit of a degree. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be able to afford to go back.\u201d\nA clear sign that something was amiss in Montgomery courts came in November 2013, when a federal lawsuit was filed alleging that city judges were unlawfully jailing the poor. A similar suit was filed in 2014, and two more civil rights cases were filed in 2015. Johnson and McCullough were plaintiffs.\nThe lawsuits detailed practices similar to those that helped fuel protests in Ferguson, Missouri, after a white police officer killed a Black teenager in 2014. In a scathing report on the origins of the unrest, the U.S. Department of Justice exposed how Ferguson had systematically used traffic enforcement to raise revenue through excessive fines, a practice that fell disproportionately hard on Black residents.\n\u201cMontgomery is just like Ferguson,\u201d said Karen Jones, a community activist and founder of a local educational nonprofit. Jones has led recent protests in Montgomery in the wake of the killing of George Floyd, the Black man whose death under the knee of a cop in Minneapolis set off worldwide calls for racial justice.\nIn Montgomery, \u201ceverybody knew that the police targeted Black residents. And I sat in Hayes\u2019 court and watched him squeeze poor people for more money, then toss them in jail where they had to work off debts with free labor to the city.\u201d\nIt was years before the flurry of civil rights lawsuits against Hayes and his fellow judges had much impact on the commission. The oversight agency opened its Hayes case in summer 2015, nearly two years after plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers in the civil rights cases filed a complaint with the body. Hayes spent another year and a half on the bench before accepting the suspension.\nUnder its own rules, the commission could have filed a complaint and told its staff to investigate Hayes at any time. Commission director Garrett said she is prohibited by law from explaining why the commission didn\u2019t investigate sooner. The investigation went slowly, Garrett said, because it involved reviewing thousands of pages of court records. The commission also was busy with other cases from 2015 to early 2017, Garrett said, issuing charges against five judges, including Moore.\n\u201cSLAP IN THE FACE\u201d\nA few months after Judge Hayes\u2019 suspension ended, his term as a municipal judge was set to expire. So, the Montgomery City Council took up the question of the judge\u2019s future on March 6, 2018. On the agenda of its meeting: whether to reappoint Hayes to another four-year term.\nHayes wasn\u2019t in the audience that night, but powerful supporters were. The city\u2019s chief judge, Milton Westry, told the council that Hayes and his colleagues have changed how they handled cases involving indigent defendants, \u201csince we learned a better way of doing things.\u201d In the wake of the suits, Westry said, Hayes and his peers complied with reforms that required judges to make audio recordings of court hearings and notify lawyers when clients are jailed for failing to pay fines.\nAs part of a settlement in the civil case, the city judges agreed to implement changes for at least two years. Those reforms have since been abandoned, Reuters found. Both measures were deemed too expensive, Hayes and city officials confirmed.\nResidents who addressed the council were incredulous that the city would consider reappointing Hayes. Jones, the community activist, reminded council members that Hayes had \u201cpleaded guilty to violating the very laws he was sworn to uphold.\u201d\nThe city council voted to rehire Hayes to a fifth consecutive term.\nMarquita Johnson said she can\u2019t understand why a judge whose unlawful rulings changed the lives of hundreds has himself emerged virtually unscathed.\n\u201cHiring Hayes back to the bench was a slap in the face to everyone,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt was a message that we don\u2019t matter.\u201d\nOn Thursday, Hayes will retire from the bench. In an earlier interview with Reuters, he declined to discuss the Johnson case. Asked whether he regrets any of the sentences he has handed out, he paused.\n\u201cI think, maybe, I could have been more sympathetic at times,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cSometimes you miss a few.\u201d\nReporting By Michael Berens and John Shiffman.

Under Rule 50, that would not be allowed at next year\u2019s Tokyo Olympics.\nThe IOC said earlier this month that it would consult with athletes to \u201cexplore different ways for athletes to express support for the principles enshrined in the Olympic charter in a dignified way\u201d.\nCarlos, who had won bronze in the 200 metres, was expelled from the Mexico Olympics with gold medallist Tommie Smith after they raised their fists and lowered their heads during the playing of the U.S. national anthem.\n\u201cThe Olympic and Paralympic movement simultaneously honors athletes like John Carlos and Tommie Smith ... while prohibiting current athletes from following in their footsteps,\u201d the USPOC AAC letter continued.\n\u201cCarlos and Smith risked everything to stand for human rights and what they believed in, and they continue to inspire generation after generation to do the same.\u201d\nThe letter called for the IOC to develop a \u201cnew structure\u201d that allowed freedom of expression on human rights issues that align with Olympic principles.\n\u201cAligning with such principles will allow athletes to give the world hope beyond sport - hope that voices matter and are a powerful tool for change,\u201d it said.\nReporting by Nick Mulvenney, editing by Simon Cameron-Moore\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"url": "/article/idUSKBN23Y0SB", "headline": "NWSL players take a knee during national anthem as Courage prevail", "published_date": "2020-06-27", "text": "By Reuters Staff\n2 MIN READ\n(Reuters) - Every player from the North Carolina Courage and Portland Thorns took a knee during the U.S. national anthem and wore t-shirts with the slogan \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d prior to their National Women\u2019s Soccer League (NWSL) match on Saturday.\nIn a joint statement, the players said they did so to protest racial injustice, police brutality and systemic racism against Black people and other people of color in America.\n\u201cWe love our country and we have taken this opportunity to hold it to a higher standard,\u201d the players said.\n\u201cIt is our duty to demand that the liberties and freedoms this nation was founded upon are extended to everyone.\u201d\nThe protest was popularized by San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick in 2016 and the gesture has again gained steam following the death of George Floyd, a Black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis last month.\nSaturday\u2019s match in suburban Salt Lake City, Utah, marked the first time a major North American league has returned to action since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, which upended the sports calendar in March.\nThe favored Courage prevailed 2-1 over the Thorns after Lynn Williams headed in the game winner in stoppage time to kick off the month-long Challenge Cup tournament.\n\u201cI think we have things to work on,\u201d Williams said.\n\u201cI have to work on my finishing, there\u2019s some rust in there, but overall I couldn\u2019t ask for anything better than to come out with a win.\u201d\nLater on Saturday the Washington Spirit will take on the Chicago Red Stars.\nReporting by Rory Carroll in Los Angeles;

REUTERS/Julia Rendleman\nAccording to Reuters/Ipsos polls this month, only one in five respondents agreed the United States should use \u201ctaxpayer money to pay damages to descendants of enslaved people in the United States.\u201d\nCalls are growing from some politicians, academics and economists for such payments to be made to an estimated 40 million African Americans, amid an expanding discussion about race in America. Any federal reparations program could cost trillions of dollars, they estimate.\nSupporters say such payments would act as acknowledgement of the value of the forced, unpaid labor that supported the economy of Southern U.S. states until the Civil War ended slavery in 1865, the broken promise of land grants after the war and the burden of the century and a half of legal and de facto segregation that followed.\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted on Monday and Tuesday showed clear divisions along partisan and racial lines, with only one in 10 white respondents supporting the idea and half of Black respondents endorsing it.\nRepublicans were heavily opposed, at nearly 80%, while about one in three Democrats supported it.

Fifty-nine percent of Americans said police were too violent when handling people suspected of crimes, up 15 points from a similar poll in July 2016.\nThe polls were conducted after the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody ignited national and international protests against police brutality and racial injustice.\nThe economic crash caused by the coronavirus pandemic has also focused attention on gaps in economic outcomes between Black and white Americans, despite decades of efforts to prevent discrimination in hiring, housing and education.\nBlack adults have been hit harder by job losses in recent months, reversing recent progress in closing the roughly 2-1 gap in unemployment rates with white Americans - a racial wedge that has existed for as long as joblessness has been calculated.\nMedian income for Black families is about 57% that of white ones, a gap that compounds over time into dramatic differences in wealth as well.\nThe failure of efforts to offset inequality, beginning with broken promises of farmland for freed slaves after the Civil War, \u201claid the foundation for the enormous contemporary gap in wealth between Black and White people in the U.S.,\u201d Duke University economist William Darity and writer A.

It also means relying on criminal justice systems that are biased against Black people, academics said.\n\u201cThe way that law enforcement is addressing (human trafficking) right now is a microcosm of everything that the Black Lives Matter movement is talking about,\u201d said Vanessa Bouche, an Associate Professor at Texas Christian University.\nBetween 2005 and 2015, 57% of defendants in U.S. federal minor sex trafficking trials, a focus for prosecutors, were African-American, said Bouche, who built a case database. Yet only about 13% of the U.S. population is African-American.\nOn average, Black people convicted of sex trafficking minors are sentenced for 39 months longer than white people, she added.\nAnd Black victims discovered by police on anti-trafficking raids are routinely treated with suspicion, said Bridgette Carr, director of the University of Michigan Law School\u2019s Human Trafficking Clinic, which gives free legal support to victims.\nTrafficking victims are often arrested for crimes they had been forced to commit - from prostitution to dealing drugs.\n\u201cWe know that Black victims ... are pushed more into being criminals and not being offered services,\u201d Carr said, adding that the racialized idea of \u201cperfect victims\u201d who always cooperate with police was damaging to anti-trafficking efforts.\nDebbie Ariyo, who runs the British charity Africans Unite Against Child Abuse (AFRUCA), said Black trafficking victims were also often ignored or dismissed by authorities in Britain.\n\u201cLaw enforcement agencies have failed to protect survivors due to a lack of knowledge and understanding of cultural practices that foster trafficking and exploitation,\u201d she wrote in a recent opinion piece for the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n\u2018WHITE SLAVERY\u2019\nEnglish and American laws and global agreements from the early 1900s referred to \u2018white slave traffic\u2019, focusing on sex trafficking of white women mainly by immigrants or Black people.\nIn Latin America today, the issue is still described in some parts as \u2018trata de blancas\u2019 or \u2018the trafficking of white women\u2019.\n\u201cThe racialized narratives have always been central to anti-trafficking narrative or storytelling,\u201d said Brian Donovan, a cultural and historical sociologist at the University of Kansas.\nSimilar rhetoric is now used by some anti-trafficking groups to portray women in the sex trade as \u201cinnocents\u201d in need of rescue, which obscures the complex reality of sex work, he said.\nYet this legacy or the impact of a criminal justice focus on Black people are rarely discussed in anti-trafficking circles - be it by the feminist left or the conservative Christian right - according to academics and activists working on the issue.\nPart of the problem is that the non-profits involved in the movement are also too white, said Ariyo of AFRUCA in Britain.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not diverse in any way or form,\u201d she said, adding that many groups working with victims from Nigeria and Albania, for example, had no knowledge or understanding of those countries.\nIn addition to becoming more diverse, organizations should consider allying with groups looking at broader structural problems related to trafficking from poverty to prison reform and immigration to domestic violence, several researchers said.\nAbout 40.3 million people globally are estimated by the United Nations\u2019 International Labour Organization (ILO) to be enslaved today, more than at any point in history.\nYet some researchers are concerned by the widespread use of the term \u2018modern slavery\u2019 - which encompasses sex trafficking, forced labor and forced marriages - for its association and reliance on comparisons with the trans-Atlantic slave trade.\nThe term undermines the work needed to address the racism that originated in slavery, said Jennifer Suchland, an Associate Professor at Ohio State University and author on trafficking.\n\u201cAnti-trafficking organizations are not seeing the ways in which we are complicit in the continued erasure of the legacy of slavery on the present,\u201d said Suchland.\nReporting by Christine Murray; Editing by Kieran Guilbert.

REUTERS/Julia Rendleman\nAccording to Reuters/Ipsos polls this month, only one in five respondents agreed the United States should use \u201ctaxpayer money to pay damages to descendants of enslaved people in the United States.\u201d\nCalls are growing from some politicians, academics and economists for such payments to be made to an estimated 40 million African Americans, amid an expanding discussion about race in America. Any federal reparations program could cost trillions of dollars, they estimate.\nSupporters say such payments would act as acknowledgement of the value of the forced, unpaid labor that supported the economy of Southern U.S. states until the Civil War ended slavery in 1865, the broken promise of land grants after the war and the burden of the century and a half of legal and de facto segregation that followed.\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted on Monday and Tuesday showed clear divisions along partisan and racial lines, with only one in 10 white respondents supporting the idea and half of Black respondents endorsing it.\nRepublicans were heavily opposed, at nearly 80%, while about one in three Democrats supported it. The poll did not ask respondents why they answered the way they did.

Fifty-nine percent of Americans said police were too violent when handling people suspected of crimes, up 15 points from a similar poll in July 2016.\nThe polls were conducted after the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody ignited national and international protests against police brutality and racial injustice.\nThe economic crash caused by the coronavirus pandemic has also focused attention on gaps in economic outcomes between Black and white Americans, despite decades of efforts to prevent discrimination in hiring, housing and education.\nBlack adults have been hit harder by job losses in recent months, reversing recent progress in closing the roughly 2-1 gap in unemployment rates with white Americans - a racial wedge that has existed for as long as joblessness has been calculated.\nMedian income for Black families is about 57% that of white ones, a gap that compounds over time into dramatic differences in wealth as well.\nThe failure of efforts to offset inequality, beginning with broken promises of farmland for freed slaves after the Civil War, \u201claid the foundation for the enormous contemporary gap in wealth between Black and White people in the U.S.,\u201d Duke University economist William Darity and writer A.

Biden, a 77-year-old white man, defeated the most diverse slate of candidates in U.S. history to clinch the nomination to face Trump in the Nov. 3 election.\nSome Black activists said Republican President Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 victory accelerated the shift. Adrianne Shropshire, the executive director of BlackPAC, a super PAC focused on Black Democrats, noted the historic victories for women of color in 2018; 43 minority women were sworn into the current House, a record.\n\u201cVoters are saying they want candidates and elected leaders who can address the issue of structural racism,\u201d Shropshire said.\nSENDING A MESSAGE\nIn Virginia on Tuesday, Cameron Webb, a Black doctor, defeated a raft of fellow Democrats to win the nomination in a competitive Republican-leaning House district.\nIn Kentucky, Black state lawmaker Charles Booker, until recently an afterthought in the Democratic primary to select an opponent for Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, mounted an unexpectedly robust challenge to Amy McGrath, the former Marine fighter pilot backed by the party leadership. The race was too close to call with absentee ballots pending.\nMondaire Jones and Ritchie Torres, either of whom would be the first openly gay Black member of Congress, appeared likely to prevail over crowded primary fields in two open House seats in heavily Democratic districts in and around New York City.\nThe 14-term Democratic Representative Carolyn Maloney of New York held a narrow lead over Suraj Patel, a 36-year-old business professor of Indian descent who has questioned whether Maloney, 74, is the right person to address institutional racism.\nThe increased diversity is not limited to Democrats. The number of Republican House candidates who are members of minorities rose from 12.6% in 2018 to 20% in 2020 in the 22 states that held primary elections before this week, said Fraga, the Indiana University professor.\nMany of the contests on Tuesday featured overlapping dynamics beyond race, including generational and ideological clashes.\nBowman and Booker were among those endorsed by liberal stalwarts like Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren over more moderate incumbents, while young candidates like Patel argued their campaigns represented an opportunity for change.\nThe protests have deepened Black voters\u2019 determination to send a message, according to Cliff Albright, the co-founder of the nonprofit group Black Voters Matter Fund.\nHe traveled from his home in Atlanta to Kentucky for Booker\u2019s primary, where he saw dozens of voters, many of them Black, chanting \u201cOpen the doors!\u201d outside a polling place that closed at 6 p.m. in Louisville.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever seen, at a polling place after it closed, people banging on the doors,\u201d he said.\nReporting by Joseph Ax, Editing by Soyoung Kim and Cynthia Osterman\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"url": "/article/idUSL8N2E14YL", "headline": "Reform, not revolution, is path to <b>Black</b> equality, says UK activist", "published_date": "2020-06-25", "text": "By Guy Faulconbridge, Dylan Martinez\n3 MIN READ\nLONDON (Reuters) - Those fighting for Black racial equality in Britain need to put realistic reform over dreams of revolution, said Imarn Ayton, an activist who has had a prominent role in protests that swept London in recent weeks.\n ADVERTISEMENT: Your content will begin in 1 seconds\nThe death of George Floyd, who gasped \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d as a white U.S. police officer kneeled on his neck, has prompted a reassessment of racism and triggered protests across the world.\nBut within Britain\u2019s Black Lives Matter movement there are differing opinions over what to aim for and how to achieve it: some make more radical demands, like abolishing the police and capitalism, while others, like Ayton, favour more gradual reform.\n\u201cI want to achieve equality and justice for Black people,\u201d Ayton, 29, told Reuters in Peckham, south London, where she has lived for 20 years. \u201cI am very much focused on putting a spotlight on institutionalised racism - that is my main focus.\u201d\nAyton is calling on the government to implement findings of a series of reviews on ethnic injustices including the Lammy Review of 2017.

It passed the assembly on June 11 with a 56-5 vote.\n\u201cMaybe we\u2019ll be a model for what can happen at the federal level,\u201d Weber told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nThe bill goes next to the California State Senate, where she expects it to pass and then be signed into law by the governor.\nThe idea of reparation is nothing new and has been used around the world to compensate victims of war, rape, terror and a host of other historical injustices.\nYet the United States has never made much headway in its discussions of whether or how to compensate African Americans for more than 200 years of slavery inflicted on their ancestors by white people. In the subsequent decades, racial inequality in wealth, housing, healthcare and education has persisted.\nSome Democrats want a commission to look into reparations, but the bill that would do this - H.R. 40 - has been on the table for decades and never garnered broad support.\nNow that Floyd\u2019s death has shed light on racial inequality, advocates say support for reparations is up. Like Weber, many do not plan to wait on the federal government to make a move.\n\u201cThere are a lot of things happening locally,\u201d said Justin Hansford, a law professor and director of the Thurgood Marshall Civil Rights Center at Howard University.\n\u201cReparations are going to happen locally first, and then later on, there\u2019s likely to be a national response as well.\u201d\nIn partnership with Columbia University, Howard University last week launched a project to identify and support local efforts to provide redress to African Americans - both for slavery and for racially motivated crimes.\nCalled the U.S. African American Redress Network, it details more than 100 efforts to make good, ranging from public apologies to compensation in the form of scholarships or cash.\nLOCAL ACTION\nThere are several cases of reparations being paid to African Americans which advocates say could serve as a blueprint.\nIn the earliest example, the state of Florida in 1994 awarded payment and free college tuition to descendents of the victims of a massacre 71 years earlier, when a white mob burned their town to the ground.\nGeorgetown University and Virginia Theological Seminary are among schools pledging to offer funds for descendants of the slaves that built them or were sold to finance them.\nAnd last year the city of Evanston, in Illinois, created a reparations fund to bridge the racial wealth gap among its residents, funded by taxes on marijuana.\nThere are many different ways to pay reparations, but what matters is the intent, said Weber, the assemblywoman.\n\u201cThat\u2019s normally what people do who believe that others have been wronged. You try to figure out how you can level the playing field,\u201d she said.\nEven private industries donating to racial justice funds can be seen as a form of reparations, said Hansford.\n\u201cTo me that is acknowledgement that there needs to be an investment in order to get healing,\u201d he said.\nBig companies from Bank of America to PepsiCo have pledged millions on addressing racial inequality since Floyd\u2019s death.\nIn Britain, insurer Lloyd\u2019s of London and the pub chain Greene King have apologized for their role in the slave trade and also said they will invest in Black communities and talent.\nPOLITICAL ROADBLOCK\nThe issue gained national attention last year when several Democratic primary candidates endorsed reparations. Presidential nominee Joe Biden has said he supports a study.\nThe national bill has more backing than ever, but not among Republicans, whose vote it would need to pass the Senate.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says reparations are a bad idea because \u201cnone of us currently living are responsible\u201d for slavery.\nLawmakers in at least five states have introduced their own legislation to explore the issue.\n\u201cSome of the political actors do believe that they have a better chance of passing these bills in the midst of the current wave of protests,\u201d said William Darity, a professor at Duke University who co-authored a book on reparations.\nSmall-scale initiatives are admirable, but anything less than a national effort will be insufficient to close the racial wealth gap, said Darity.\nThe average Black household has a net wealth $800,000 lower than the average white household, he estimates.\n\u201cThe states and the localities, they just don\u2019t have the capacity to meet that task,\u201d said Darity, who suggests giving each of the roughly 40 million Black Americans descended from slaves up to $250,000 in a trust.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the federal government that should be the culpable party because [it] created the legal and the authority framework that permitted all of these atrocities to take place,\u201d he added.\nGlobally, there are precedents.\nGermany paid millions to Holocaust survivors and South Africa compensated apartheid victims. Family members of disappeared Colombians, rape survivors, and those displaced in the country\u2019s armed conflict have been compensated since 2011.\nIn response to protests over racial inequality, the top United Nations official for human rights called on countries to make amends for racist violence through reparations.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no amount of money that can be paid, really, to fully repair,\u201d said Arif Ali, a lawyer who was part of a U.N. team on compensation for victims of Iraq\u2019s 1990 invasion of Kuwait.\nAli said that under international law, the United States was obliged to pay - it is now just a matter of working out how.\n\u201cThe experience of other countries is a reference point,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a way.\u201d\nReporting by Nellie Peyton and Christine Murray; editing by Lyndsay Griffiths.

He was released from a police cell without charge after the mayor and local police chief intervened.\nThe ordeal left Drame psychologically scarred.

But attitudes towards him on the proudly democratic island have become more conflicted.\nChiang\u2019s defeated Nationalist government fled to Taiwan after losing the Chinese civil in 1949.\nDuring the Cold War, he was backed strongly by the United States, and some Taiwanese still view him positively for standing up to Mao Zedong\u2019s communism.\nBut, many others revile him as a despot who imprisoned and killed opponents during a reign of terror. When he died in 1975, his son Chiang Ching-kuo took over and began tentative steps towards more political openness.\nYvon Lin, 36, a Taipei city councillor for the small New Power Party, which supports Taiwan\u2019s formal independence, said the question of what to do with statues of the Chiangs was problematical as they were such polarising figures.\n\u201cTaiwan is quite special in that around half of people really support what the two Chiangs did in the past, so if we want to get rid of the symbols of authoritarianism these people could come out and protest,\u201d Lin told Reuters.\nIn the past few years some statues have been daubed with paint, often around the anniversary of a 1947 anti-government uprising, generally seen as the start of Chiang\u2019s \u201cwhite terror\u201d campaign against dissent in Taiwan.\nHis Nationalists took control of the island from Japan in 1945 at the end of World War Two.\nNowadays, at the mausoleum in Taoyuan, outside Taipei, tourists pose for pictures as they gather round the statues depicting Chiang in various roles, from kindly father figure, to wise scholar, to military commander.\nJust as the Black Lives Matter movement has inspired a debate in Western countries over what to do with statues of people connected with the slave trade, Taiwan has also been coming to terms with a checkered history.\nUnder 2017\u2019s Act on Promoting Transitional Justice, symbols of Taiwan\u2019s authoritarian era are supposed to be removed, renamed or \u201chandled in other ways\u201d.\nYet enforcement is not specified, leaving local governments to make their own decisions.\nTaiwan independence protesters threw red paid on Chiang\u2019s sarcophagus at the mausoleum two years ago, something visitor Lin He-sheng expressed regret about.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a need to be like that with someone who has died,\u201d Lin told Reuters at the statue park. \u201cYou should look at his positive side.

Decommunisation has not happened.\u201d\nUkraine has torn down many more Soviet statues than Russia, especially since 2014, when mass street protests in Kyiv drove President Viktor Yanukovich from power.\nRemaining Soviet monuments were then targeted for their association with Yanukovich, who had tried to rebuild closer ties with Moscow, recalled Volodymyr Viatrovych, Chairman of Ukraine\u2019s Institute of National Remembrance.\n\u201cPeople started to discuss the communist past, the crimes of the communist regime and why they should never be repeated,\u201d he said. \u201cEspecially during the winter of 2014, hundreds of Lenin monuments were toppled as symbols of everything Soviet-related.\u201d\nA law was later passed banning communist symbols in Ukraine.\nAdditional reporting by Dmitry Turlyun; Writing by Polina Ivanova; Editing by Gareth Jones\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"url": "/article/idUSKBN23U1X5", "headline": "Fact check: A member of the Queen\u2019s Guard did not punch a <b>black</b> man to the ground", "published_date": "2020-06-23", "text": "By Reuters Staff\n3 MIN READ\nA video is circulating on social media purporting to show a member of the Queen\u2019s Guard (who guard the official royal residences in the United Kingdom) punching a black man to the ground.

So if someone harasses a Black woman, he knows she has no connections... and this makes it easier for her to be harassed,\u201d Ksiksi said.\nTunisia became the first Arab country in October 2018 to criminalize racial discrimination, with the first conviction under the law taking place in February 2019.\n\u2018PROUD OF MY COLOUR\u2019\nBut from Egypt to the Palestinian territories, deep-rooted racist views are coming under attack.\nEarlier this month, Egyptian actor and singer Mohamed Ramadan called out a woman who commented on a photo of his son to say it was unfortunate the boy turned out Black like his father instead of inheriting his mother\u2019s lighter skin.\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of my color... and I\u2019m happy my children will grow up to be anti-racism,\u201d Ramadan wrote on his Facebook page.\nIn a viral Instagram video, Palestinian actress Maryam Abu Khaled said she hoped future generations would not endure the anti-Black comments she grew up hearing, such as parents warning their children to avoid the sun so they would not look like her.\nFor Ali, who was often told she was \u201cpretty for a black girl\u201d, the protests sparked by last month\u2019s killing of Black American George Floyd by a white Minneapolis police officer had triggered some long-overdue soul searching closer to home.\n\u201cPeople are starting to understand that \u2018okay, maybe now I should be more socially aware of my anti-Blackness\u2019,\u201d she said.\n\"This is a huge change from the race conversation completely not existing in the Arab world to people now calling each other out.\" (Reporting by Ban Barkawi @banbarkawi; Editing by Helen Popper.

REUTERS/Axel Schmidt\nExamples of the posts can be found here , here , and here .\nAccording to the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), a civil rights organization that tracks hate and extremist groups (  www.splcenter.org/hate-map  ), the myth of the \u201cIrish slaves\u201d has been a favorite meme of the far-right for the past few years (  here  ). Described by the SPLC as historical \u201crevisionism,\u201d the narrative \u201chas attracted Neo-Nazis, White Nationalists, Neo-Confederates, and even Holocaust deniers, while racist\u202ftrolls have deployed the myth to attack the Black Lives Matter movement.\u201d\nInterviewed by the SPLC, Liam Hogan, an Irish librarian and independent scholar, has written extensively on these memes since he first saw one in 2013 ( here, tinyurl.com/y9yho7mg ).\nThe image in the social media posts, taken by Lewis W. Hine, is titled \u201cYoung Oyster Shuckers\u201d and has the following caption: \u201cGroup portrait of young girls working as oyster shuckers at the canning company at Port Royal, SC, 1911. From left to right: Josie, six years old, Bertha, six years old, and Sophie, 10 years old.\u201d The photo was taken over four decades after the end of the Civil War and the abolition of slavery in the U.S. (here ).\nThe claim that the first slaves to arrive in the American colonies were white children is false. The Africans who were taken to the colony of Virginia in 1619 had been captured in Angola (  here  ). In the summer of 1619, two English ships attacked a Portuguese ship carrying 350 African captives, taking 50-60 Africans with them to Virginia. The first British ship arrived with 20 enslaved Africans, making them the first to arrive in the American colonies and inspiring the New York Times\u2019 1619 Project ( here , here  ).\nA timeline of Virginia records provided by the Library of Congress does not mention the arrival of a shipment of \u201c100 White children\u201d from Ireland at any point between 1600 and 1743 (here).\nIt is true that Irish people were among the hundreds of thousands of indentured servants who came to North America between the 17th and 19th centuries (  here , here  ). Indentured servitude describes a system of labor by which a servant worked for four to seven years in exchange for passage to and food and shelter in the New World (  here ). Historian Alan Taylor explained that many of these indentured servants prior to 1620 \u201cwere forcibly transported either as unwanted orphans or as criminals punished for vagrancy and petty theft,\u201d while after 1620 most were \u201ctechnically volunteers\u201d (  here ).\nThe life of an indentured servant was hard (  here ). Servants received severe punishments, and contracts could be extended for breaking a law like running away, or becoming pregnant. But although the system was harsh, it can\u2019t be equated with the brutal system of racialized chattel slavery that came to dominate the American agricultural economy by the turn of the 18th century. Though some of the first enslaved Africans were initially treated similarly to indentured servants, slave laws passed in Massachusetts in 1641 and in Virginia in 1661 stripped blacks of any freedom they had been previously given.\nSlavery in British North America and eventually the United States was not only a permanent condition, but a hereditary one passed down from mother to child (  here , here  ). Considered chattel, enslaved people were bought, sold, and treated as property (  here  ). This was not the case with indentured servitude, which declined in the second half of the 17th century as colonists made the full transition to African slave labor (  here, here, here  ) Provided by the Library of Congress, collections of primary sources on American slavery can be found here .\nVERDICT\nFalse. The first slaves to arrive in British North America in 1619 were not \u201c100 white children,\u201d but 20 African captives. Although the Irish were among the indentured servants who arrived in the colonies, indentured servitude and chattel slavery were two very different systems.\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.

Even among Republicans, only 8% say immigration is their top concern in the latest poll, a big drop from January 2019, when 34% of Republicans listed it as the most important problem facing the country.\nAnalysts also say that kind of grievance-centered politics geared toward white Americans may have lost relevance amid a reckoning over the injustices faced by African Americans - and that as president, Trump has struggled to find others to blame for the state of the nation.\nBetween April and June, Trump\u2019s approval rating among white evangelicals dropped 11 percentage points. Approval among rural voters tumbled 14 points over the past month, with more than half saying they are sympathetic to the Black Lives Matter protesters.\nAlex Conant, a Republican strategist, said that the party was bracing for a \u201cvery bad\u201d year in 2020, with Trump\u2019s poll numbers affecting other key races in the Senate and down the ballot. But he added that November was not a foregone conclusion.\n\u201cFive months is a long time in politics,\u201d he said.\nGraphic - Turning away from Trump: here\nReporting by James Oliphant, Chris Kahn and Jeff Mason; Editing by Soyoung Kim and Peter Cooney\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"url": "/article/idUSKBN23O30J", "headline": "Soccer: Players take a knee as Premier League restarts", "published_date": "2020-06-18", "text": "By Simon Evans\n3 MIN READ\nMANCHESTER, England (Reuters) - Premier League players, including champions Manchester City, took a knee before kickoff in support of the \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d movement as the English season restarted on Wednesday.\n The league returned after a 100-day hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the teams and match officials sent out a strong statement of support for the worldwide protests against racism.\nPlayers at the opening game at Villa Park between Aston Villa and Sheffield United, which ended goalless, took a knee just before the kickoff along with the referee.\nThe same happened before Manchester City\u2019s home game against Arsenal and came after a video presentation with anti-racist messages featuring City forward Raheem Sterling and manager Pep Guardiola.\nAll the players\u2019 names on the back of their shirts were replaced with the words \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d as the league formally joined the international protest campaign sparked by the death last month of George Floyd, a black man, at the hands of Minneapolis police officers.\nThe kneeling protest followed a moment\u2019s silence before kickoff in memory of those who died in the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe match at a rainy Villa Park was also the first in Premier League history to be played without fans, and with strict health protocols in place.\nSlideshow ( 6 images )\nOnly 300 personnel were allowed into stadiums divided into three different security zones to try to restrict any possible spread of the novel coronavirus, which has claimed close to 42,000 lives in the United Kingdom.\nThere was none of the traditional routine at the start of a match, with teams emerging from their changing rooms separately, players lining up two metres apart and handshakes banned.

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, a Republican, has appealed the ruling.\nRepublican President Donald Trump won Iowa by a 9.4% margin in the 2016 election, but a recent Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll of likely voters in the state had Trump at 44% versus 43% for his presumptive Democratic challenger, former Vice President Joe Biden.\nReporting by Simon Lewis; Editing by Paul Simao\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"url": "/article/idUSKBN23O23F", "headline": "Dalit killings in Nepal spark outrage over caste discrimination", "published_date": "2020-06-17", "text": "By Gopal Sharma\n5 MIN READ\nKATHMANDU (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Ever since the death of a young Dalit man killed along with five friends in what activists called a \u201ccaste-based massacre\u201d, Nepalis have been taking to streets to demand an end to a form of discrimination that remains rife years after it was outlawed.\nThe protesters have not turned out in large numbers - a strict coronavirus lockdown has deterred all but the most determined.\nBut campaigners say their persistence is a sign of the outrage felt among people from Nepal\u2019s lowest caste over a failure to tackle widespread violence and discrimination, echoing the Black Lives Matter protests around the world.\nThe head of the Kathmandu-based Dalit NGO Federation said the killing of Nabaraj Bika, 21, who was chased into a river with his friends as he prepared to elope with a 17-year-old girl from a higher-caste family, was a failure of governance.\n\u201cThe state has failed to maintain law and order and prevent such illegal and inhuman acts,\u201d Bhakta Bishwakarma told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n\u201cWe are living in terror and urge the government to deliver justice to victims by punishing the perpetrators of the crime.\u201d\nNepal\u2019s government said it was committed to ensuring such \u201cgrave criminal\u201d incidents were not repeated and would to providing justice to the victims.\nDalits, formerly known as untouchables - are at the bottom of the ancient caste hierarchy linked to the Hindu faith and form more than 13% of Nepal\u2019s population.\nNepal passed a law against caste based discrimination and untouchability in 2011, yet Dalits face routine segregation and abuse and ancient biases against lower-caste groups make it harder for them to access education, jobs and homes.\nThey are frequently barred from public places including temples and water wells used by higher-caste Hindus, and restricted to work that is considered dirty or dangerous such as manual scavenging and disposing of animal carcasses.\nThere have been 33 cases of discrimination or violence against Dalits in 2020 according to Nepal Monitor, a Kathmandu-based human rights organization. Last year, it recorded 84 such incidents.\nBika\u2019s parents have said the girl\u2019s family threw stones at the men and beat them with bamboo sticks in western Nepal on May 23. The bodies of the men, four of whom were Dalit, were later found in a river.\nThe killings have triggered near-daily protests in Kathmandu and elsewhere in Nepal.\nMost have been peaceful, though police said five protesters and seven police sustained minor injuries in clashes on Monday outside the hospital where the postmortems were conducted.\n\u2018LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY\u2019\nThe United Nations and the European Union have spoken out on the latest deaths and one former prime minister, Baburam Bhattarai, has joined the protests, calling on people to adopt a Dalit surname in a country where names are markers of caste.\nBut Tek Tamrakar, who advises the United Nations on human rights issues in Nepal, said few non-Dalits were engaging with the issue, unlike in the United States, where white people have joined Black Lives Matter protests.\n\u201cEven white people are participating in the Black Lives Matter protests because they consider it as a human rights issue. They don\u2019t consider this as an issue concerning black people only,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBut in Nepal this is not the case. The issue is considered to relate the Dalits only. The society, the state, and even the courts do not consider it as a human rights issue.\u201d\nHe said that there was a \u201ccomplete lack of accountability\u201d in Nepal, where the police routinely refused to register crimes against Dalits or dismissed them as accidents.\nThe outrage over Bika\u2019s case has prompted the parliament to set up a panel to investigate the killings and police have detained 29 people including the family of the victim\u2019s girlfriend.\nOn the same day he and his friends were attacked, the body of a 12-year-old Dalit girl was found hanging from a tree in southern Nepal after she was forced to marry a higher-caste man who had raped her.\nDalit rights activist Durga Sob urged people from all castes to come out and protest against discrimination in the same way white people have in the United States.\n\u201cWhat they have in America is racism \u2013 the white discriminating against the black,\u201d said Sob.\n\u201cBut in Nepal the discrimination is against people of the same race, color, culture and religion.\u201d\nReporting by Gopal Sharma, Editing by Annie Banerji and Claire Cozens.

The scrutiny comes just as states and cities are restructuring planned spending because of revenue shortfalls from the coronavirus shutdowns.\nMore than 16,000 people submitted testimony to D.C. officials through video, emails or phone calls, compared with 24 who testified about Washington\u2019s police budget last year, D.C.

Los Angeles and New York City have proposed police budget cuts, while Boston, Lansing, Michigan, and Seattle have said they are considering them.\nLast week, the D.C. Council approved a raft of measures for the 3,800-officer police department, including banning the use of neck restraints.\nWashington Mayor Muriel Bowser had called for boosting MPD\u2019s funding by $17.5 million for fiscal 2021 in a proposed budget last month, and cutting funds to Fire and Emergency Medical Services and the Office of the State Superintendent of Education.\nShe told National Public Radio last week that she was not considering cuts to the proposed police budget of nearly $600 million, saying: \u201cMy budget doesn\u2019t fund it a penny more than we need and certainly not a penny less.\u201d\nIf D.C. passed a budget reducing police funding, it could increase friction between Bowser, a Democrat, and the White House.

This includes radical efforts to defund, dismantle and disband the police,\u201d he added.\nTrump\u2019s comments were his first offering policy proposals on policing and race following the May 25 death of Floyd, an African-American man, after a Minneapolis policeman knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. His death prompted a wave of protests in U.S. cities and abroad, re-energizing the Black Lives Matter racial justice movement.\nTrump has drawn fire for calling on state governors to crack down on the protesters and threatening to send in the U.S. military.\nU.S. President Donald Trump is greeted as he arrives for a roundtable discussion with members of the faith community, law enforcement and small business at Gateway Church Dallas Campus in Dallas, Texas, U.S., June 11, 2020.

He did not identify any specific policy proposals but said Trump was willing to work with lawmakers on the issue.\nSome Republicans in Congress have indicated support for certain measures proposed by Democrats, including a ban on the use of chokeholds and eliminating the legal defense of \u201cqualified immunity,\u201d which helps officers evade civil rights lawsuits.\nBut it is unclear whether Democrats and Republicans will be able to overcome partisan differences to pass legislation that Trump would be willing to sign.\nReporting by Steve Holland; Additional reporting by Daphen Psaledakis; Writing by Mohammad Zargham and Lawrence Hurley; Editing by Chris Reese and Peter Cooney\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"url": "/article/idUSKBN23I1TU", "headline": "Gay Pride embraces its roots by teaming up with U.S. <b>black</b> activists", "published_date": "2020-06-11", "text": "By Alicia Powell, Jill Serjeant\n3 MIN READ\n(Reuters) - Floats, all-night parties and parades may be out, but the LGBTQ community is returning to its roots by teaming up with black activists for Pride month celebrations in the United States.\n ADVERTISEMENT: Your content will begin in 1 seconds\nWhile the coronavirus epidemic has forced the cancellation of traditional Pride events in June, U.S. gay groups are using virtual gatherings to amplify the voices of people of color, whose demands for social justice are taking the nation by storm.\n\u201cPride started as a riot that was led by two women of color at Stonewall 51 years ago,\u201d said Sarah Kate Ellis, chief executive of LGBTQ group GLAAD. \u201cIt is part protest, part celebration.

With Congress today proposing legislation to ban chokeholds, that\u2019s a major step forward. Arguments about defunding the police are also on the horizon.\nFor instance, in New Jersey, we\u2019ve seen examples of the defunding of the police and getting rid of police departments. Whether it\u2019s outright abolition or not, at least the conversation is on the table.\nPeople are thinking seriously about restraining police and keeping them from murdering innocent people, especially unarmed black folk. I think it will make a huge and profound difference in how we view policing in this country.\nLauren Young: Companies are donating money to organizations like Black Lives Matter. What are your thoughts on these contributions, and what is the best way for that money to be put to work to produce socio-economic change?\nMD: It\u2019s a beginning, it\u2019s not an end, and it means that people are taking seriously what needs to be done \u2014 not just individual charity, but systemic change. That can be fostered by changing the corporate atmosphere and making sure that these things occur not episodically but on a routine basis.\nThe best way for that money to be put to work to produce change is to allow the people who are making the change to be supported \u2014 people on the streets or people behind corporate desks who are black and brown who understand the need for change in America and then ultimately funding those organizations that have been at this for a long time.\nLY: How can white people respond to racial injustice now?\nMD: I discuss these issues in the last chapter of my book. \u2018Individual reparations account\u2019 means that white brothers and sisters don\u2019t have to wait for the government to engage in thinking about ideas to help those most in need of help.\nEducate yourselves. Think critically about the issues that are prevailing. Talk to many black people, not just one. And then talk to white people yourselves. The greatest thing that I think a white person can do is to convince another white person that they have to address these issues.\nGo to Thanksgiving dinner, eat your pumpkin pie first, then get down to business. Talk to granny and the nephews, aunts and uncles, too.\nAJ: What are you optimistic about now?\nMD: The great theologian Reinhold Niebuhr said \u2018Optimism is a shallow virtue.\u2019 Hope is different. It\u2019s deeper. It digs into the resources of our collective will to be better. Hope begets hope.\nEven when it looks dark, the stars are shining. So as a Baptist preacher for 41 years and as a professor, I think we\u2019ve got to hope. I think this is a great time. People are taking this seriously. White brothers and sisters are asking serious questions; they\u2019re in the streets with black people and Latinx people and others.\nWe must take advantage of this. I am more hopeful now, despite the misery and the crisis that has occurred, because I believe that together, \u2018E Pluribus Unum\u2019 (out of many, one).

Kendi, author of \u201cHow to Be an Antiracist\u201d and director of the Center for Antiracist Research at Boston University, as part of our #AskReuters Twitter chat series.\nFILE PHOTO: A demonstrator holds a sign during a protest against police brutality of Rio's police forces and racism, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil June 7, 2020. REUTERS/Ricardo Moraes/File Photo\nBelow are edited highlights.\nLauren Young: We\u2019ve seen protests and marches for racial equality for decades. What is different about this moment in history?\nIbram X. Kendi: The demonstrations have literally rocked every part of the United States, from small towns to big cities. And more white people than ever before, according to some recent surveys, recognize that racism is an essential problem and are demonstrating for antiracist change.\nArlene Washington: Can you explain the distinction between a racist and an antiracist?\nIK: A racist is one who is expressing a racist idea or supporting a racist policy with their actions or inaction. An antiracist is one who is expressing an antiracist idea or supporting an antiracist policy with their actions. Racist ideas suggest certain racial groups are inferior or superior; that something is wrong with let\u2019s say black people. Antiracist ideas suggest the racial groups are equals even amid cultural differences. Racist policy leads to racial inequity; antiracist policy, racial equity.\nAW: Can you address the racism that exists within the black community?\nIK: To grow up in the U.S. is to be raised to believe there is something wrong with black people, which are racist ideas. Black people too internalize these anti-black racist ideas and when they do they attack other black people as the problem instead of racist power and policy. The only thing wrong with black people is that we think something is wrong with black people.\nAW: During your talk with Brene Brown, you mentioned \u201cshame is not a social justice tool.\u201d Can you expound more on that and what that looks like in action?\nIK: People feel ashamed when diagnosed as racist. But do people feel ashamed when diagnosed with cancer when living in a polluted neighborhood? No, they often recognize their bodies were polluted; just as our minds have been polluted with racist ideas legitimizing racist policy.\nThe question is will we continue to pollute society, harm people with our racism? Or, will we get treatment? Will we be part of the movement to heal our society, to heal the victims of racism by ensuring they have equitable opportunities and resources and power?\nLY: What is your take on defunding police departments?\nIK: I support the policy. We know areas with higher levels of poverty and long-term unemployment tend to have higher levels of violent crime no matter their racial makeup. So why are we over-funding the police to battle violent crime rather than defunding the police to fund job programs?\nAW: How can parents teach tolerance and unity?\nIK: Parents should be constantly teaching their children that all the skin colors are beautiful; that people are different but that doesn\u2019t mean something is wrong with them; explaining that certain groups have more, not because they are more. Have the conversations again and again.\nLY: Do you have any thoughts on the UK taking down colonial statues?\nIK: Statues memorialize people, immortalize people in reverence. I don\u2019t think any nation should be revering racist historical figures who terrorized, enslaved, colonized, exploited, lynched, degraded, and murdered peoples of color. They should all come down now.\nAW: What gives you hope?\nIK: The resistance from coast to coast. The resistance always gives me hope.\nEditing by Lauren Young and David Gregorio\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"url": "/article/idUSKBN23H3AE", "headline": "'Treated like crap' - <b>Black</b> women march for equality in U.S. protests", "published_date": "2020-06-10", "text": "By Matthew Lavietes\n4 MIN READ\nNEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Lisa Lloyd, a black communications specialist, once discovered a white male coworker whom she had trained was earning $15,000 more than she was at rental car company where they worked in Maryland.\n\u201cOn paper, I am a senior level manager with hundreds of subordinates.

Trump and other Republicans have sought to blame violence that has flared at some protests on antifa despite little evidence.\nRegarding Gugino, the Republican president cited a report by pro-Trump channel One America News Network, which also offered no evidence. The OANN piece was narrated by a Russian native who has worked for the Kremlin-controlled Sputnik news outlet, according to the Daily Beast and the New York Times.\n\u201cThe president was just raising some questions, some legitimate ones, about that particular interaction. And it\u2019s his prerogative to do so,\u201d White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany told Fox News on Wednesday.\nDemocrats and other critics have blasted Trump\u2019s tweet and urged the president to apologize, while numerous Republicans in Congress and Trump\u2019s chief of Staff Mark Meadows declined to comment, according to media reports.\nA lawyer for Gugino called Trump\u2019s statement \u201cdark, dangerous, and untrue,\u201d according to media reports. Gugino told USA TODAY he had \u201cno comment other than Black Lives Matter\u201d and that he has been released from intensive care and \u201cshould recover eventually.\u201d\nBuffalo Police Officers Aaron Torgalski, 39, and Robert McCabe, 32, face felony assault charges over the incident.\nReporting by Maria Caspani in New York and Barbara Goldberg in Maplewood, New Jersey; Writing by Susan Heavey; Editing by Will Dunham\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"url": "/article/idUSKBN23H28F", "headline": "Fact check: Death of six police officers did not occur during recent protests", "published_date": "2020-06-10", "text": "By Reuters Staff\n3 MIN READ\nImages being shared on social media make the claim that six police officers have died in the last 10 days, implying a connection to the protests triggered by the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who died after a white police officer knelt on his neck on May 25 in Minneapolis.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic\nNEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Social media can jump-start national movements: think Black Lives Matter and #MeToo. It\u2019s also a means of forcing companies to listen to staff and customer grievances. In that sense, Twitter and its ilk stand in for the old solidarity of workers\u2019 unions. But the power of social media is also easily misdirected.\nJames Bennet, a New York Times editor, stepped down on Sunday after the paper published an op-ed written by a U.S. senator advocating military intervention during national protests over the death of George Floyd. Several staffers protested on Twitter and more than 800 signed a letter denouncing the column for inaccuracies and for potentially putting journalists in danger alongside protesters.\nIll-judged posts that provoked employees and backers also forced out the editor in chief of Bon Appetit magazine, Adam Rapoport, and drew an apology from Greg Glassman, who founded the CrossFit exercise brand \u2013 but not before he lost supporters including Adidas-owned Reebok, a sponsor.\nEven Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg was on the receiving end of a virtual walkout by employees because the founder declined to fact-check or flag some posts by President Donald Trump.\nThe New York Times union weighed in on the latest controversy there, but overall, organized labor has been on the wane. In 1954, more than one in three U.S. workers was in a union. Last year, the rate was a wisp over 10%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nSocial media provides a natural vent for outrage and a meeting ground to coordinate with like-minded people when there\u2019s no established forum for it. Campaigns can encourage companies to examine cultural biases, hire more diverse workers, address pay gaps, and ensure benefits like sick leave. That\u2019s powerful, and good.\nThe downside is that Twitter, Facebook and the rest can also be used to spread misinformation and fire up mobs. Even in the worst old days, unions and management eventually had to listen to each other, agree on basic facts, and compromise.

A Reuters/Ipsos poll released last week showed that seven out of 10 suburban women expressed sympathy toward the protesters and six of 10 disapproved of Trump\u2019s handling of the civil unrest.\n\u201cI think there is a maternal instinct that kicks in seeing someone\u2019s son calling for his mom,\u201d said Carrie Firestone, 49, a mother of two teenage daughters in Avon, Connecticut, referring to Floyd\u2019s plea caught on video before his death.\nFirestone, who is white, said she organized a Black Lives Matter protest last week with hundreds of people in the predominantly white Hartford suburb of about 18,000 people, photos of which she posted with a tweet: \u201c#IAmASuburbanMom who brought the protest to the suburbs.\u201d\nBecker-Finn said she coined the hashtag and added it to her Twitter post on Friday without much thought. As of Monday, it had appeared in more than 40,000 tweets.\n\u201cThis law and order message, while we\u2019re seeing videos every day of officers doing things that none of us should feel comfortable with, it\u2019s not in line with the humanity of most folks,\u201d Becker-Finn said.\nGazelka did not respond to requests for comment.\n\u2018DEFUND THE POLICE\u2019\nRepublicans have expressed confidence that Trump\u2019s strong stance against the demonstrations - he advocated a militarized response - would resonate with suburban voters, as activists on the left advocate to \u201cdefund the police.\u201d\nThe term refers to eliminating or cutting spending on police departments, often the largest expense for municipalities, and using the funds for education, social welfare, housing and other community needs. Trump and Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate in the Nov. 3 U.S. election, both oppose the idea.\n\u201cVoters can trust in President Trump to protect their communities and return the country to peace and prosperity,\u201d said Courtney Parella, a Trump campaign spokeswoman.\nTrump\u2019s calls for \u201claw and order\u201d resemble the campaign message of Republican Richard Nixon when he was seeking the presidency in 1968 in a year marked by anti-Vietnam War protests as well as urban rioting triggered by the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King.\nThe changing demographics of America\u2019s suburbs and cities may make it harder for Trump to sell that message, according to University of Florida history professor Paul Ortiz.\n\u201cTimes have really changed. You do have more African-Americans and people of color who live in the suburbs. You have more white individuals who have moved back to the city,\u201d Ortiz said.\nBiden and allied political groups have experienced a swell in donations since the protests, according to top fundraisers.\nWintana Melekin, executive director of the nonpartisan advocacy group Minnesota Voice that promotes social and racial justice and voter participation, said volunteerism through her organization was now \u201cthrough the roof.\u201d\n\u201cIt has skyrocketed in a way that I never imagined,\u201d said Melekin, who served as political director for liberal U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar\u2019s 2018 campaign.\nSuburban women played a key role in a wave of Democratic victories in 2018 U.S. House of Representatives races. A Reuters/Ipsos poll last month showed college-educated white women supporting Biden over Trump by a margin of 23 percentage points, up 4 percentage points from the previous month. Hillary Clinton, Trump\u2019s 2016 Democratic opponent, won this group by just 7 percentage points.\nJason Lewis, a Republican seeking to defeat Democratic U.S. Senator Tina Smith of Minnesota, reiterated his party\u2019s message that suburban voters want law and order.\n\u201cWithout public safety, nothing else matters,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cTime will tell.\u201d\nReporting by Michael Martina; Additional reporting by Jarrett Renshaw and Jason Lange; Editing by Soyoung Kim and Will Dunham\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"url": "/article/idUSKBN23G2W8", "headline": "MSG, Knicks reverse course, issue statement on racism", "published_date": "2020-06-09", "text": "By Reuters Staff\n2 MIN READ\nFILE PHOTO: New York Knicks owner James Dolan looks on during a news conference announcing Phil Jackson as the team president of the New York Knicks basketball team at Madison Square Garden in New York March 18, 2014.

It occurs to all black LGBT people,\u201d said Mariah Moore of the U.S. rights group Transgender Law Center.\n\u201cWe are the people that are not being heard in this movement.\u201d\nA fifth of U.S. trans people reported discrimination when seeking a home, and more than one in 10 say they have been evicted for being trans, according to the National Center for Transgender Equality.\nAlso, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the rate of trans people who have been diagnosed with HIV is triple the national average.\nMany U.S. organizations working on racial justice have seen a deluge of funding since the protests began, but resources for trans groups lag behind, organizers say.\nDonations to an online fundraiser for homeless black trans women in Atlanta surged to more than $1.8 million following Floyd\u2019s killing, while a Minneapolis bail fund, which collects money to post bail for people who have been detained, raised more than $20 million.\nReporting by Oscar Lopez @oscarlopezgib; editing by Ellen Wulfhorst.

It\u2019s as if nobody good lives here,\u201d said Rafaela Coutinho Matos, mother of the slain boy, in an interview.\nAuthorities told her family the death was an accident, she said. They said helicopters spotted a man they thought was the target of a police raid hopping over a fence near the pool.\nIn a statement, Rio state police said detectives had opened an investigation into the incident and three officers had been suspended. Brazil\u2019s federal police, which also participated in the operation, did not respond to a request for comment.\nSuch tragedies are commonplace in Rio, where a notoriously violent police force killed 1,814 people last year, according to official statistics. They killed 606 more in the first four months of 2020.\nMany killings of unarmed black men, or children, come and go with relatively little protest or media attention.\nSlideshow ( 14 images )\nYet anger at Jo\u00e3o Pedro\u2019s death and other recent complaints of police brutality are boiling over in Brazil against a backdrop of widespread U.S. demonstrations after the May 25 death of George Floyd in police custody.\nSUPREME COURT ORDER\nOn Friday, hundreds gathered outside the S\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alo city hall, chanting \u201cNo justice, no peace!\u201d in Portuguese.\nMany focused their ire on Bolsonaro and Rio Governor Wilson Witzel, both far-right politicians that have encouraged police to kill more criminals. Witzel, a former judge, said a surge in police killings under his watch \u201cisn\u2019t difficult to justify.\u201d\nAlso on Friday, Supreme Court Justice Edson Fachin issued an order prohibiting police raids in Rio\u2019s cinderblock slums, known as favelas, until the worst of the COVID-19 outbreak subsides. The order, which made reference to Jo\u00e3o Pedro\u2019s death, allows raids only under \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d with prior approval by state prosecutors.\nOn Sunday, anti-racism marches in major Brazilian cities brought out the largest crowds of anti-Bolsonaro protesters since the pandemic arrived in March. In the capital Brasilia, demonstrators in masks carried \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d banners emblazoned with Jo\u00e3o Pedro\u2019s name.\nPublic safety expert Ignacio Cano said that such fallout from a police killing was unprecedented, suggesting that news from the United States had heightened sensitivities in Brazil.\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad in a way that part of Brazilian society has to look at the U.S. to realize that the problem exists at home,\u201d said Cano, a professor at Rio de Janeiro State University.\n\u201cAnd the media is giving a lot more coverage now after the George Floyd case than they would otherwise give to the recurrent cases of executions in favelas.\u201d\nAt Friday\u2019s protest in S\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alo, black college student Mykaella Moreira echoed demands for human rights that have taken center stage in the United States as well.\nSlideshow ( 14 images )\n\u201cWe can\u2019t accept this genocidal state, which thinks we can die for nothing,\u201d Moreira said. \u201cWe are also people.

In October, Reuters published an investigation into the death of Brayan Mattos dos Santos, a 19-year-old who was also the unintended victim of a raid here.\nThis year, police in the area are set to break their own grim record, having killed 103 people in the district in the first four months of 2020. In March, police here set a monthly record, killing 33 people, according to public data.\nAlthough whites make up half the population in Rio, they account for only 12% of police killings, according to data obtained by Reuters last year under a freedom of information request.\nJo\u00e3o Pedro was studious, devout and went nowhere without family, said his mother Rafaela.\nOn the day he was killed, Rafaela said the boy was visiting his cousin about a kilometer away to play by the pool.\nShe learned that Jo\u00e3o Pedro had been injured when her husband entered the family home in a panic, saying their son had been shot and taken to a hospital by helicopter.

The killing has triggered protests against racism and police brutality in cities and smaller communities nationwide, as well as demonstrations by supporters around the world.\nSome activists have called on social media for a million people to attend Saturday\u2019s rally in the U.S. capital. Local media has predicted tens of thousands will attend.\nOn the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, Delonno Carroll, a 27-year-old construction worker, said he had come out to demonstrate because he \u201csimply cannot\u201d sit and watch from home.\n\u201cOur voices need to be heard,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cNo longer can we have a man call out for his mom on the streets and have to go through what George Floyd did.\u201d\nSix buses unloaded several hundred uniformed military personnel, most wearing body armor and carrying shields, at the White House grounds early on Saturday, a Reuters photographer said. Military Humvees were parked on tree-lined city streets.\nPolice -- who drew criticism for firing smoke grenades and chemical irritant \u201cpepper balls\u201d before charging into peaceful protesters near the White House on Tuesday -- were out in smaller numbers around the marchers on Saturday afternoon and generally in a more relaxed posture, wearing patrol uniforms rather than body armor and helmets.\nBy noon, about 3,000 demonstrators had gathered at the Lincoln Memorial and about the same number were near the White House, DC police reported. Another group of protesters was in front of the U.S. Capitol.\nSome passing motorists honked their horns in support, and some city residents came out on the street to hand out water and snacks to offer protesters relief from the sweltering heat.\nHundreds of demonstrators who marched past the George Washington University Hospital chanted \u201cHands up, Don\u2019t shoot!\u201d \u201cWe March for hope, not for hate,\u201d and \u201cI can\u2019t breathe!\u201d\nThat last chant echoed protests from New York in 2014, when Eric Garner died in police custody after an officer used a banned chokehold on him. Garner and Floyd are part of a long line of black men and women killed by white officers.\n\u2018EXTREME TACTICS\u2019\nFootage of Floyd\u2019s death recorded by an onlooker showed the man repeatedly pleading for his life and telling the officers he could not breathe, before he went silent.\nA second memorial service was held for Floyd on Saturday in North Carolina, where he was born. Hundreds lined up at a church in Raeford to pay their respects during a public viewing, and a private service for the family was scheduled for later in the day.\nThousands took to the streets across Europe and Australia, as did hundreds in Tokyo and Seoul, in support of U.S. protests against police brutality.\nMarches and rallies took place on Friday in Atlanta, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, Miami, New York and Denver, among other places. The night-time protests were largely peaceful but tension remains high even as authorities in several places take steps to reform police procedures.\nA federal judge in Denver ordered city police to stop using tear gas, plastic bullets and other \u201cless-than-lethal\u201d devices such as flash grenades, with his ruling citing examples of protesters and journalists being injured by police.\n\u201cThese are peaceful demonstrators, journalists, and medics who have been targeted with extreme tactics meant to suppress riots, not to suppress demonstrations,\u201d U.S. District Judge R. Brooke Jackson wrote in the ruling.\nIn Minneapolis, Democratic city leaders voted to end the use of knee restraints and choke holds, while California\u2019s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, said he would end state police training of restraints that restrict the carotid artery in the neck.\nIn New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo said his state would lead the way in passing reforms including banning choke holds and making police disciplinary records publicly available.\n\u201cMr Floyd\u2019s murder was the breaking point,\u201d said Cuomo, a Democrat. \u201cPeople are saying enough is enough.\u201d\nBUFFALO OFFICERS ARRAIGNED\nBlack Lives Matter activists have called for cities to defund police departments. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, a Democrat who in April proposed increasing law enforcement funding, this week reversed course and said he would seek some $150 million in cuts to the Los Angeles Police Department.\nIn a case from New York state that drew condemnation after two police officers were filmed shoving a 75-year-old protester to the ground in Buffalo, the two officers were arraigned on second-degree felony assault charges on Saturday.\nThe officers, who were supported outside the court house by hundreds of law enforcement colleagues, pleaded not guilty during a virtual arraignment, according to a spokeswoman for the local district attorney\u2019s office.\nThe victim was treated for a head injury, loss of consciousness and bleeding from the right ear, authorities said, and remains hospitalized in critical condition.\nThe demonstrations have erupted as the American public and businesses struggle to recover from sweeping lockdowns imposed to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus.

Some residents said they were marching as a way to try to move beyond their own community\u2019s past.\nJoe Plemon, 73, an elder at the First Evangelical Presbyterian Church, said he had prepared several Bible passages - laments - to read at the protest.\n\u201cWe have been challenged within my own denomination, and I know this is going on at other churches as well, to say, \u2018Let\u2019s not just wink at this, let\u2019s step up, let\u2019s admit the things that we\u2019re ashamed of and let\u2019s confess the places where we\u2019ve sinned.\u2019\u201d\nAnna was once known as one of the \u201csundown towns,\u201d or thousands of American localities where black people were not welcome, according to sociologist and historian James Loewen, who wrote a book about the phenomenon.\nWhile most national attention has been focused on massive demonstrations and violent clashes with police in the United States\u2019 biggest cities like New York and Los Angeles, hundreds of spontaneous demonstrations have popped up in little towns and rural areas across the nation in recent days.\nBuzzFeed reporter Anne Helen Petersen based in Missoula, Montana, has gathered a growing thread of local news reports and social media posts showing nearly 250 protests in smaller communities - some with just a few hundred residents - in all 50 states.\nMany of them are being held in conservative towns like Anna, which is 90% white and sits in a county where Republican President Donald Trump won 68% of the votes in the 2016 election.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t put our head in the sand,\u201d Plemon said. \u201cIt\u2019s good for us to step up and say we want to be part of the solution.\u201d\nOne of the mostly young organizers was 18-year-old Jenna Gomez from nearby Cobden, Illinois, who said she is used to seeing Confederate flags displayed by area businesses.\nGomez had thought maybe a handful of people would show up to the event when she and some others started a group chat about it.\n\u201cWe wanted to show everyone that we are not the past,\u201d she said at the rally over cheers and a call-and-response of \u201cUnited we stand!

To finish, Bowser posted on Twitter a video taken from a nearby roof showing the White House overlooking the results.\n\u201cThere are people who are craving to be heard and to be seen,\u201d Bowser told a news conference, \u201cand to have their humanity recognized, and we had the opportunity to send that message loud and clear on a very important street in our city.\u201d\nGlynda Carr, president and chief executive of Higher Heights for America PAC, a political action committee dedicated to helping more liberal black women win elective office, said Bowser \u201cshowed the world that she leads, unbought and unbossed.\u201d Carr\u2019s organization has never raised money for Bowser.\nFor his part, the Republican president denounced Bowser as \u201cincompetent.\u201d\nWashington\u2019s status as the seat of the federal government has not always been a comfortable fit for its residents or elected leaders. The city\u2019s population of about 700,000 people - 46.4% black and 45.6% white, according to the Census Bureau - is politically liberal and heavily Democratic.\nThe ongoing protests over the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis last month, have heightened that tension and thrust Bowser - mayor since 2015 - into the national spotlight.\nBowser has supported peaceful demonstrators while denouncing violence and looting. Trump has advocated a militarized response to civil unrest and even summoned a contingent of active-duty troops to Washington, though they were never deployed on the streets. Bowser said she did not want any out-of-state military forces in Washington.\nWhen Trump threatened protesters who come near the White House with \u201cvicious dogs\u201d and \u201cominous weapons,\u201d Bowser shot back with a comment that summed up their relationship.\n\u201cThere are no vicious dogs & ominous weapons.

Washington\u2019s mayor was a federal appointee until the 1970s when the city was granted \u201chome rule\u201d and began electing its mayors.\nBowser also clashed with Trump during the federal government shutdown in 2019, over relief funds offered to the city during the coronavirus pandemic and over his plans to hold a grand military parade in the capital.\nTrump castigated her on Twitter on Friday.\n\u201cThe incompetent Mayor of Washington, D.C., @MayorBowser, who\u2019s budget is totally out of control and is constantly coming back to us for \u2018handouts,\u2019 is now fighting with the National Guard,\u201d Trump wrote.\nReporting by Nandita Bose in Washington; Editing by Heather Timmons and Will Dunham\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"url": "/article/idUSL1N2DI28H", "headline": "'Am I going to get shot?' kids ask, as brands try to explain racism and violence to children", "published_date": "2020-06-06", "text": "By Arriana McLymore\n4 MIN READ\nNEW YORK, June 6 (Reuters) - For 8 minutes and 46 seconds - the length of time it took George Floyd, an unarmed black man, to die at the hands of Minneapolis police - cable TV kids channel Nickelodeon\u2019s screen went black on Tuesday to sounds of inhaling and exhaling, as white text flashed \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d\nPokemon pledged $100,000 in support for Black Lives Matter.

Let me up, please! Help please! I can\u2019t breathe!\u201d\nThe last words not of George Floyd, but of Aboriginal man David Dungay Jr as he laying dying on the floor of his jail cell in Australia, a case strikingly similar to the one that has sparked mass protests against racial injustice.\nThe death of 26-year-old Dungay in 2015 garnered relatively little attention in Australia, where indigenous people account for a disproportionate number of prisoners and rank near the bottom on economic and social indicators.\nBut the reaction to Floyd\u2019s death in Minneapolis has inspired protests in every major city in the country, prompting some indigenous Australians to question why it took an American incident to turn the spotlight on their plight.\n\u201cSuddenly people are saying, \u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019, and we\u2019re like, \u2018so when did this happen?\u2019,\u201d University of Queensland senior academic Chelsea Bond told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nIndigenous Australians are the most incarcerated people in the world.\nDespite making up about 2 per cent of Australia\u2019s population, they account for 28 per cent of the adult prison population.\nIn the Northern Territory, 84 per cent of prisoners are indigenous, while indigenous Australians make up more than half those in the youth justice system nationally.\nThey are also more likely than white Australians to die in custody. That was the subject of a national inquiry in 1991 that made more than 300 recommendations, many of which have still not been implemented.\nSince then, more than 430 indigenous Australians have died in custody, and the inquests into their deaths have continued to call for reform.\nBut Bond said the problems facing indigenous Australians went far beyond policing.\n\u201cIn every institution in this country we have indigenous peoples dying as a result of the state\u2019s failures,\u201d she said, citing \u201cpreventable and avoidable\u201d health conditions that she said were not being treated.\nThe mortality rate of indigenous children is twice that of non-indigenous children, while overall life expectancy is about eight years less.\nThe employment rate for indigenous Australians is about 50 per cent, one third lower than for non-indigenous Australians.\nIn 2008, Australia\u2019s state and federal governments set targets to address these issues, but 10 years on they are only on track to meet two.\nThe office of the minister for indigenous affairs did not respond to a request for comment.\nMOMENTUM FOR CHANGE\nOn Monday Australia\u2019s Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the protests in America made him think \u201chow wonderful a country is Australia\u201d.\n\u201cAustralia is not the United States,\u201d he said.\nBut many Australians have a less optimistic view.\nBelinda Stevens\u2019 mother died from a traumatic brain injury in 2017 after she repeatedly fell and hit her head in her cell.\nThe 55-year-old was arrested for public drunkenness after failing asleep on a train, and it was hours before officers entered the cell to check on her.\nThe inquest found her race played a part in her death and Stevens has no doubt her mother would have been treated differently if she was not an Aboriginal woman.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got an opportunity now to work together to fix the problem. But part of that is acknowledging there is a problem,\u201d said Stevens, whose family has been pursuing justice for almost three years.\n\u201cAnd when you\u2019ve got the leader of the country saying we live in a fair country that\u2019s not acknowledging the problem.\u201d\nAbout 50,000 protesters had been expected at nationwide events on Saturday, before authorities in the state of New South Wales secured a court injunction to prevent the largest rally planned for Sydney.\nYet advocates are cautiously hopeful the momentum for change will grow.\nThey are calling for better use of alternatives to custodial sentences, independent oversight of suspected incidences of police brutality, and an obligation to implement recommendations made by coroners looking into deaths in custody.\nFederal opposition spokeswoman Linda Burney, an indigenous woman, said Morrison need only think back to November when an Aboriginal man with an intellectual disability was shot in his bedroom by police.\n\u201cI think the idea of fairness is a very strong part of Australian ethos and culture, but in terms of whether an Aboriginal child enjoys the same life choices and chances as a non-Aboriginal child in this country, that is not the case,\u201d she said.\nReporting by Tiffanie Turnbull; Editing by Claire Cozens.

The officers involved lied about the incident, which was captured on film by an amateur photographer. I remember seeing the video, footage from the protests, and King\u2019s famous \u201ccan we all get along?\u201d statement. Four officers were charged; all were eventually acquitted. Two weeks prior Soon Ja Du, an LA convenience store owner shot 15 year old Latasha Harlins in the back of the head. Du accused Harlins of attempting to steal a $1.79 bottle of orange juice; Harlins had cash-in-hand and police concluded that Harlins intended to pay. Du accused Harlins of stealing and grabbed her arm, Harlins punched Du, and Du shot Harlins as she attempted to leave the store. The jury found Du guilty of voluntary manslaughter and recommended the maximum sentence of sixteen years jail time. The trial judge overruled the jury recommendation, stating that Du behaved \u201cinappropriately\u201d but understandably. Du was sentenced to five years\u2019 probation, 400 hours of community service, and a $500 fine. An appeals court upheld the ruling 3-0 on April 21, 1992. A week later all four officers were acquitted in the King case, kicking off six days of protests which resulted in 63 deaths and eclipsed the city\u2019s Watts protests of 1965. As then the situation centered around violence against people of color with seeming impunity.\n\u201cA decade later, while I was living in Cincinnati, 19-year old Timothy Thomas was killed by a Cincinnati Police officer during a police pursuit in April of 2001. Thomas was pursued for 10 minutes by nine officers over 14 non-violent minor offenses, of which 12 were traffic violations. Thomas suddenly came in contact with a CPD officer, surprised, shot and killed Thomas at point blank range. The officer allegedly believed that Thomas was reaching for a gun, although subsequent investigations determined that he was likely adjusting his baggy pants. As is common in these cases, Thomas\u2019s life and death hinged on an officer\u2019s distinction between being uncomfortable and being afraid. And like many of these cases, the officer\u2019s claimed belief of bodily danger legitimized the use of deadly force. The protests lasted five days and centered around Cincinnati\u2019s Over-the-Rhine district, which was a predominantly black, heavily policed community where the shooting took place. The median household income in Over-the-Rhine was about $8,600 at the time but has since become whiter and wealthier through to gentrification. The Thomas incident also kicked off a local debate sometimes described as \u201crespectability politics,\u201d with some black leaders blaming black culture for Thomas\u2019s death and advocating behavioral changes. The issue was not the extra-judicial killing of a US citizen over \u201cdriving without a license\u201d citations; it was a lack of respect for law and order. If we as black people changed our behavior, pulled our pants up, and were respectable, all our problems would be answered. If our parents took a firmer hand, beat us when needed, and policed our behavior, law enforcement officials wouldn\u2019t have to. But NYPD officers discharged 41 rounds Amadou Diallo despite his being unarmed and having committed no crime.\n\u201cA decade later in November 2011, while I was living in Chicago I was leaving a rec-league dodge ball game when I was approached by two Chicago police officers. They asked where I was coming from and I explained. They then then told me that I matched the description of an individual who had reportedly stolen from a residence in the area. The description was a black male in shorts and a t-shirt; nothing else. No color for either article of clothing, and in a city with just under 1 million black people I was obviously the culprit. I\u2019d clearly spent too much time around hyper-rational people who respected me and knew where I went to school and how much money made. In a lapse of judgment I tried to explain how absurd it all was while presenting my ID and found myself slammed against the hood of a police cruiser. The officer who shoved me looked afraid more than anything, and while I was confident I could have taken both in a fair fight guns are scary so I worked to de-escalate the situation. I was basically living out my nightmare of at least the past 10 years, where I\u2019d decide whether to deploy lethal force to defend myself from law enforcement. I\u2019d previously decided that if things went left I would fight, rush to my apartment, call the legal counsel at my employer, and negotiate turning myself in. Fortunately de-escalating worked; the officers patted me down, jostled me a bit, emptied the contents of my wallet into the street one-by-one, and detained me for another ~20 minutes of shivering (I was in shorts and a t-shirt, standing outside in Chicago on a November evening). They finally let me go when another officer (possibly their superior) asked what they were doing and said \u2018That\u2019s not him.\u2019\n\u201cI went home and I cried for the first time in years. Then I filed a report with the Chicago Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA), complaint #1050215. Then I flew to London for a work trip, noted how well the Brits treated class-signaling blacks (obviously not the full story), and considered never coming back. But I returned to Chicago and gave an in-person statement. And I waited. And in February 2012 Trayvon Martin was killed by George Zimmerman. And I waited. And George Zimmerman was acquitted in 2013, impetus for the Black Lives Matter movement. And the head of IPRA resigned in 2013. And IPRA closed my complaint file claiming that their \u201cfindings of the events that occurred differed from the account provided\u201d without further detail. And in June 2014 I moved to New York to start a new job at Goldman Sachs. And in July of 2014 Eric Garner was killed by NYPD officers who approached him on suspicion of selling \u201cloosies\u201d (individual cigarettes) without the proper tax stamps (the New York City + State excise tax is $5.85 for a pack of 20 cigarettes). In August of 2014 Michael Brown was killed after allegedly stealing a box of Swisher Sweet cigarillos (approx. value $15), initiating several weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri.\n\u201cAnd in 2015 news broke that the Chicago PD had been running a \u201cblack-site\u201d undisclosed interrogation facility in the Homan Square neighborhood where over 7,000 civilians were detained since 2004; 80% of the detainees were black Americans. And the new head of IPRA resigned. And a city of Chicago lawyer resigned after burying evidence related to the killing of Darius Pinex by two CPD officers in 2011. The previous ruling (in which the shooting was deemed justified) was later thrown out, and a retrial was ordered.\n\u201cAnd some years passed, and the story played out several more times. And in 2018 Lorenzo Davis, a former IPRA investigator was awarded a $2.8mm settlement after a Cook County jury found that he was fired after refusing to change his recommendations re: police shootings he deemed unjustified (which was good-ish). And some years passed. And on February 23, 2020, Ahmaud Arbery was ambushed and killed by a former police officer and his son in Glynn County, Georgia. On March 13, 2020 Breonna Taylor was killed by Louisville Metro Police officers serving a \u2018no-knock warrant\u2019 related to two individuals already in police custody. Kenneth Walker (Taylor\u2019s partner at the time) fired upon the officers with a licensed and then called 911 to report the home invasion and shooting of his girlfriend. Kenneth was initially charged with first-degree assault and attempted murder of a police officer (charges were dropped in May 2020). George Floyd was killed on May 25, 2020 after Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds (while Floyd was hand-cuffed and lying face down). Floyd was extra-judicially killed on suspicion of using a counterfeit $20 bill at a local market. And some NYPD SUVs drove through a crowd on Saturday. And some Minnesota police officers screamed \u201cLight \u2018em up!\u201d before firing on a woman and her family while they stood on their front porch in accordance with the curfew.\n\u201cSo as to how it\u2019s going- it\u2019s not great.\nFred\n\u201cp.s.

Goldman executive's email on racial inequality in America", "published_date": "2020-06-04", "text": "By Reuters Staff\n12 MIN READ\nJune 4 (Reuters) - Frederick Baba, a managing director at Goldman Sachs who is black, sent the following email to colleagues at the bank on June 2:\n\u201cTo everyone who\u2019s asked me some variant of \u201chow\u2019s it going?\u201d over the past month, I\u2019ve probably lied. Or lacked the words to articulate it fully, but I\u2019m giving it a shot. Obviously my experience is just one along a continuum of black experiences, and I don\u2019t presume to speak for all black people (or even all black people at Goldman Sachs). But the past few months have been demoralizing, and family/friends/colleagues I\u2019ve spoken with and listened to across the firm and country seem to share this feeling. Being black has been nothing if not instructive. I\u2019ve learned history and why people live where they do and why those in positions of power often don\u2019t look like me. I\u2019ve learned that bad things are more likely to happen to black people solely because they\u2019re black. I learned which of my friends\u2019 parents didn\u2019t want me in the house growing up and who would be blamed if my friends broke the law. I\u2019ve learned how to prove intelligent, to prove not threatening, to prove innocent after being assumed guilty. To prove human as this country litigates my personhood in case after case. As if our lives are expendable but we could never rebuild a Louis Vuitton store or a burned out Target. As if MLK\u2019s nonviolent philosophy allowed him to opt-out of death by white supremacy. As if COVID ravaging minority communities is an acceptable, inevitable cost, and our lives just aren\u2019t worth the points off GDP. It\u2019s a lot.\n\u201cMy family immigrated to the US in 1990; this weekend I realized that my earliest memory in the US was the assault on Rodney King (where a group of LAPD officers struck an unarmed citizen some 50 times and kicked him 8 times during a traffic stop in March 1991). The officers involved lied about the incident, which was captured on film by an amateur photographer. I remember seeing the video, footage from the protests, and King\u2019s famous \u201ccan we all get along?\u201d statement. Four officers were charged; all were eventually acquitted. Two weeks prior Soon Ja Du, an LA convenience store owner shot 15 year old Latasha Harlins in the back of the head. Du accused Harlins of attempting to steal a $1.79 bottle of orange juice; Harlins had cash-in-hand and police concluded that Harlins intended to pay. Du accused Harlins of stealing and grabbed her arm, Harlins punched Du, and Du shot Harlins as she attempted to leave the store. The jury found Du guilty of voluntary manslaughter and recommended the maximum sentence of sixteen years jail time. The trial judge overruled the jury recommendation, stating that Du behaved \u201cinappropriately\u201d but understandably. Du was sentenced to five years\u2019 probation, 400 hours of community service, and a $500 fine. An appeals court upheld the ruling 3-0 on April 21, 1992.

REUTERS/Eric Miller\nThe union\u2019s labor contract with the city is a formidable roadblock to citizens seeking disciplinary action after aggressive encounters with police. Led by Lieutenant Bob Kroll, the union\u2019s vocal and hard-charging president for five years, officers rarely face sanctions, Reuters has found.\nA Reuters analysis of complaints against Minneapolis police officers from the past eight years shows that 9 of every 10 accusations of misconduct were resolved without punishment or intervention aimed at changing an officer\u2019s behavior. The analysis covers about 3,000 complaints during that period; five officers were fired.\nThe Minneapolis union contract is not unusual. Dozens of other contracts across the United States contain provisions that stymie efforts to hold cops accountable for violence and other alleged abuses, a 2017 Reuters investigation found. The news agency examined contracts in 82 cities for that article and found that 46 required departments to erase disciplinary records, some after just six months. The absence of a paper trail makes firing officers with a history of abuses difficult, lawyers and police chiefs say.\nCompounding the challenge for citizens seeking justice: a U.S. legal doctrine called qualified immunity. A Reuters investigation last month found that the concept, created and reinforced in a series of U.S. Supreme Court rulings, increasingly shields from civil liability officers who are accused of using excessive force.\n\u201cYou have immune police officers who are beyond punishment because of their union contract as well as constitutional law,\u201d said Gloria Browne-Marshall, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York.\n\u201cThat combination leads to an arrogance of a police officer who can kill a man in broad daylight while being taped and believe he can get away with it,\u201d said Browne-Marshall, who teaches constitutional law. \u201cWhen there are no consequences, that\u2019s when people act with impunity.\u201d\nTo see the prior Reuters special reports, click here and here\nIn Minneapolis, officers have successfully used the qualified immunity doctrine to win civil lawsuits against them in federal courts. It is difficult to identify all excessive force lawsuits in federal court records, but Reuters found 28 such cases from 2006 through 2018 in which Minneapolis police officers raised a qualified immunity defense. Judges sided with the officers in 15 of those, ending the cases without a jury trial.\nThe union contract and the qualified immunity doctrine play a role in emboldening some officers to commit abuses, legal scholars say, but they don\u2019t always provide a shield in cases that trigger criminal charges or unleash national media scrutiny -- as has now happened in Minneapolis.\nCRIMINAL CHARGES\nAll four officers present in the death of Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, have been criminally charged in the case. The state\u2019s attorney general on Wednesday charged Derek Chauvin with second-degree murder and Tou Thao, J. Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane with aiding and abetting second-degree murder.\nThe county attorney had charged Chauvin on Friday with third-degree murder and manslaughter. The state\u2019s attorney general, Keith Ellison, said Wednesday that he and the prosecutor now believe the evidence warrants the stronger charge.\nGraphic videos show Chauvin, who is white, kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck for more than eight minutes as the unarmed man gasped for breath and groaned, \u201cPlease, I can\u2019t breathe.\u201d\nKueng and Lane also restrained Floyd, while Thao stood nearby.\nChauvin was jailed Friday, and the other three were booked Wednesday. All four officers were fired soon after the incident.\nIn a letter to union members on Monday, Federation president Kroll wrote that he was working with the union\u2019s labor attorneys to get each of the officers reinstated.\n\u201cThey were terminated without due process,\u201d Kroll wrote.\nWARRIOR-STYLE POLICING\nSince Floyd\u2019s death, the usually outspoken Kroll has said little in public. He did not respond to interview requests from Reuters. In Monday\u2019s letter, he criticized elected leaders for their handling of widespread protests in the wake of Floyd\u2019s death. He praised the city\u2019s police officers for their response to \u201cthe largest scale riot Minneapolis has ever seen\u201d and characterized the unrest as a \u201cterrorist movement\u201d that has been building for years.\nThat quickly drew blowback from city leaders. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey tweeted: \u201cFor a man who complains so frequently about a lack of community trust and support for the police department, Bob Kroll remains shockingly indifferent to his role in undermining that trust and support.\u201d\nSome Minnesota labor unions called for Kroll\u2019s resignation. Among them: the AFL-CIO, AFSCME, and Education Minnesota. In addition, the board of the Minneapolis Public Schools unanimously voted Tuesday to terminate its $1.1 million contract with the Minneapolis Police Department in response to Floyd\u2019s death. The department had provided officers to patrol schools.\nKroll, who became union president in 2015, has locked horns with police chiefs and mayors past and present. A key point of contention: Kroll\u2019s backing of so-called warrior-style policing, which conditions officers to view all encounters with residents as inherently dangerous. After Frey stopped the department\u2019s use of such training last year, Kroll announced the union would make the training free for any officer who wanted it.\n\u201cThe culture is that when they\u2019re coming into their jobs to police, it\u2019s like they\u2019re going to a war zone,\u201d said Joshua Williams, a human rights attorney in Minneapolis. \u201cThat\u2019s the mentality -- this is not their community.\u201d\nDISCIPLINARY HURDLES\nThe long-running antagonism between the police union and the community has hamstrung efforts by Minneapolis elected officials and reform-minded department leaders to change that mentality, one former chief says.\nJane\u00e9 Harteau, Minneapolis police chief from 2012 to 2017, said arbitration rulings and union grievances that reversed disciplinary actions made it difficult to create a culture of accountability in the department.\nSlideshow ( 2 images )\nAmong the contract provisions that impede efforts to discipline abusive cops is one that forbids the department from including allegations of misconduct in an officer\u2019s personnel file unless the accusations result in discipline. That means investigators cannot consider an officer\u2019s history of complaints while probing a new allegation.\nDuring investigations into misconduct complaints, the contract grants officers concessions that are not afforded to civilians suspected of wrongdoing. Officers are entitled to a written summation of the accusation and events, and they are given as long as two days to consider that information and to consult with a union representative before they can be called to give a statement to investigators.\nSuch \u201ccooling off\u201d periods are typical of police union contracts across the country, said Samuel Sinyangwe, a policy analyst, and they allow officers to \u201cessentially get their facts right\u201d before talking to the department\u2019s internal investigators.\nSome city officials say the very structure of the Minneapolis police union creates ethical concerns during the disciplinary process. Supervisors, who are in charge of discipline, are part of the same union that seeks to protect accused officers. Mayor Frey has sought to end this arrangement.\nEven when officers are fired for misconduct, the union contract allows them to petition an arbitrator for their job back. Should the four officers in the Floyd case be found not guilty in criminal court, they could seek reinstatement under the contract.\nTaxpayers often help pay to defend officers accused of misconduct, even in wrongful death. That is because the contract requires the city to provide legal representation to defend against job-related charges.\nA FRUSTRATED CHIEF\nIn an interview, Harteau, the city\u2019s first female chief and its first openly gay chief, cited particular frustration with how long it took to get one Minneapolis police officer with a long history of citizen complaints off the force.\nIn 2016, she fired Officer Blayne Lehner for violating the department\u2019s use of force policy after video showed him repeatedly throwing a woman to the ground while responding to a domestic disturbance. Over his 18-year career, he had accumulated more than 30 complaints. An arbitrator, concluding that Lehner\u2019s use of force was not \u201csubstantially inappropriate,\u201d overturned the chief\u2019s decision and reduced the sanction to a 40-hour suspension without pay.\nLehner stayed on the force for three more years, until he was fired last year after another accusation of excessive force. The same arbitrator, Stephen Befort, upheld the termination.\n\u201cThese cases are difficult and every arbitrator I know agonizes over the appropriate outcome,\u201d Befort told Reuters this week.\nLehner did not respond to a request for comment. In arbitration filings during the 2016 case, the union said his use of force was \u201cmeasured in its severity\u201d and that \u201cLehner\u2019s long and good work should be treated as a mitigating factor.\u201d\nJim Pasco, executive director of the Fraternal Order of Police, the nation\u2019s largest law enforcement union, said it\u2019s easy to blame union contracts when clashes between police and civilians spark public outrage. But cities have a role in shaping those contracts, too.\n\u201cIt\u2019s become a blame game,\u201d Pasco said. \u201cThe thing that critics never say is that contracts aren\u2019t forced down the throats of anyone. They are negotiated.\u201d\nPolice unions do not \u201crecruit, screen or supervise officers,\u201d he said, suggesting that low hiring standards, inadequate training and lack of supervision by top management undermine the quality of police forces. \u201cNot everyone is suited to be a police officer,\u201d Pasco said.\nThe FOP represents more than 2,000 law enforcement agencies, but it does not represent the Minneapolis Police Department, which has its own union.\nBLUE WALL OF SILENCE\nHarteau did have some successes. She began training to help officers recognize implicit biases, and in 2016, she rolled out the department\u2019s body camera program, despite fierce opposition from the union.\nShe said she met resistance \u201cat just about every turn\u201d from the police federation. She said Floyd\u2019s death shows how the culture among Minneapolis rank-and-file discourages intervening when a colleague is out of line.\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe we hire bad cops,\u201d former chief Harteau said. \u201cI think events occur and we let things go unchecked.\u201d\n\u201cThe union\u2019s perspective is we need to support the cops no matter what,\u201d she said. \u201cI support good work, but we cannot support or condone those that do not do a good job or act consistent with our core beliefs and values.\u201d\nKroll voiced his views on officer conduct following a police shooting in 2015. During a meeting, he told the legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota that he \u201cviewed policing and complaints like you view a basketball game, in that if you\u2019re not getting any fouls you aren\u2019t playing hard enough.\u201d\nACCUSATIONS OF RACISM\nKroll has himself been the subject of 10 misconduct complaints since 2013, police records show. The records don\u2019t disclose the allegations against him. None of the complaints resulted in discipline; one remains open.\nHe also was mentioned in a 2007 discrimination lawsuit filed against the department by five black officers. Among the plaintiffs: Medaria Arradondo, who was then a lieutenant in the force and is now the chief, having succeeded Harteau.\nIn court filings, Arradondo and his fellow officers alleged that the Minneapolis police force had \u201ca history of tolerating racist and discriminatory remarks by its white police officers.\u201d The suit described an incident in 1992 in which every African-American officer received a hate letter through the interoffice mail that threatened their lives. The letters were signed \u201cKKK,\u201d the suit said.\nThe lawsuit specifically called out Kroll. It alleged that Kroll referred to Keith Ellison, then a U.S. congressman, as a \u201cterrorist.\u201d Ellison, who is black and Muslim, became the state\u2019s attorney general in 2019 and is now helping to prosecute the four officers involved in the Floyd case. The suit also alleged Kroll wore \u201ca motorcycle jacket with a \u2018White Power\u2019 badge sewn onto it.\u201d\nThe police chief at the time sent an email to all employees denouncing the alleged comments, and Kroll told the St. Paul Pioneer Press that he thought Arradondo and the four other officers were on a fishing expedition. \u201cEver hear the phrase \u2018throw a lot against a wall and hope something sticks?\u2019\u201d he said then.\nThe suit was settled in 2009 for $740,000.\nArradondo, who became chief in 2017, has sought to stop at least one policing practice that disproportionately affects black residents. He ended low-level marijuana stings after the Hennepin County public defender found that almost every arrestee was black. On Sunday night, Arradondo said on CNN that Floyd\u2019s killing \u201cwas a violation of humanity.\u201d\nIn the wake of Floyd\u2019s death at the hands of a white officer, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz announced Tuesday that the state Department of Human Rights would begin a civil rights investigation into Minneapolis Police Department policies and practices over the last 10 years. Its mission: to determine if the department \u201chas engaged in systemic discriminatory practices towards people of color and ensure any such practices are stopped.\u201d\nA RARE SPLIT\nAs union president, Kroll has also clashed with the Hennepin County prosecutor. In 2018, Kroll defended officers who refused to be interviewed for the county attorney\u2019s 2018 investigation into the death of a 40-year-old white woman shot by a police officer in the alley behind her home.\nThe woman, Justine Damond, was barefoot and in her pajamas. The prosecutor, who eventually charged officer Mohamed Noor with murder, had to convene a grand jury and subpoena the officers to get their testimony. Noor, who pleaded not guilty to all charges, was convicted of third-degree murder and manslaughter, and was sentenced to 12-1/2 years in prison.\nThe incident marked a rare split between prosecutors and police in the United States, who typically work closely in pursuing cases. The prosecutor in the Noor case, Hennepin County Attorney Michael Freeman, is now involved in the prosecution of the four officers involved in Floyd\u2019s death. He declined to comment for this story, but in a 2018 statement to the media, he said he was left with no choice but to subpoena the officers in the Noor investigation.\nKroll defended the position of the officers in the Noor case, saying at the time that they were acting under the terms of the union contract. The contract, which remains in effect, specifies that police statements to investigators are voluntary and \u201cmade at the discretion of the officer.\u201d In an interview with a local radio station in 2018, Kroll said it was unfair to say the police had not cooperated.\n\u201cThe thing is, they were asked to come in for a voluntary statement, and not volunteering does not mean not cooperating,\u201d he said.\nReporting by Reade Levinson and Michael Berens.

But not all was calm.\nIn New York City\u2019s Brooklyn borough, police in riot gear charged into a crowd of about 1,000 protesters defying a local curfew, albeit peacefully, near an outdoor plaza, and clubbed demonstrators and journalists as they scurried for cover in a downpour of heavy rain.\nThe confrontation in Brooklyn seemed to be the biggest exception to a calmer night, hours after the new charges in Minneapolis.\nMORE CHARGES\nDerek Chauvin, jailed Friday on charges of third-degree murder and manslaughter, was newly charged with second-degree murder.\nRELATED COVERAGE\nFrom power lunches to plywood: Vandalized Washington boards up business\nOutpouring of rage over George Floyd killing tests limits of U.S. police tactics\nSee more stories\nThe added charge, defined under Minnesota law as unintentionally causing another person\u2019s death in the commission of a felony offense, can carry a sentence of up to 40 years, 15 years longer than the maximum sentence for third-degree murder.\nChauvin, 44, was the white officer seen in widely circulated video footage kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck for nearly nine minutes as Floyd gasped for air and repeatedly groaned, \u201cPlease, I can\u2019t breathe.\u201d\nFloyd, whom police suspected of trying to pass a counterfeit bill to pay for cigarettes, was pronounced dead at a hospital shortly after the May 25 encounter.\nThree fellow officers fired from the Minneapolis police department along with Chauvin the next day were charged on Wednesday - each with aiding and abetting both second-degree murder and manslaughter.\nThe three men - Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao - have also been taken into custody. Aiding and abetting second-degree murder carries the same maximum punishment as the underlying offense - 40 years in prison.\nFloyd\u2019s death has become the latest flashpoint for long-simmering rage over police brutality against African Americans, propelling the issue of racial justice to the top of the political agenda five months before the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 3.\nThe spectacle of city streets flooded with angry though mostly peaceful protesters - punctuated by scenes of arson, looting and clashes with police - have fueled a sense of crisis.\nThe upheavals have flared following weeks of social lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has forced millions of Americans out of work and disproportionately affected minorities.\nSlideshow ( 47 images )\nTRIAL MONTHS AWAY\nMinnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, a black former U.S. congressman, has requested bail of $1 million for each of the four former officers charged in the Floyd case.\n\u201cThis is a significant step forward on the road to justice, and we are gratified that this important action was brought before George Floyd\u2019s body was laid to rest,\u201d Benjamin Crump, attorney for the Floyd family, said in a statement.\nEllison told a news conference winning a conviction \u201cwill be hard,\u201d noting that Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman, whose office filed the original charges against Chauvin, is the only prosecutor in the state to have successfully convicted a police officer for murder.\nSlideshow ( 47 images )\nFully investigating the case \u201cis going to take months,\u201d he said.\nProtests erupted in Minneapolis the night after Floyd\u2019s death and quickly spread to dozens of cities large and small across the United States.\nIn many cities, demonstrators defying nighttime curfews have been met by police in riot gear firing tear gas, mace and rubber bullets to disperse unruly crowds. National Guard troops have been activated in several states to assist local law enforcement.\nAuthorities and some protest organizers have blamed much of the lawlessness on outside agitators and criminal elements.\nDEPLOYING TROOPS\nRepublican President Donald Trump has said justice must be done in Floyd\u2019s case but also touted a hard line against violent protests, threatening to use the military to restore order.\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper said he did not back deploying troops to patrol the country.\n\u201cThe option to use active duty forces in a law enforcement role should only be used as a matter of last resort and only in the most urgent and dire of situations.
