He was pronounced dead shortly after.\nThat officer, Derek Chauvin, was arrested on Friday and first charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. The new second-degree murder charge says that Chauvin killed Floyd \"without intent\" in the course of committing assault in the third degree, according to an amended complaint.\nThomas Lane and J. Alexander Kueng, who helped restrain Floyd, and Tou Thao, who stood near the others, were not initially charged.

He got along with everybody and seldom wanted anything in return for helping someone out, Jackson said.\n\"The difference between me and bro was I had more opportunity than he did,\" wrote Jackson, who won a championship with the San Antonio Spurs in 2003. \"2 things we have in common both from the bottom and both of our names will live forever.\"\nOnce Floyd moved to Minnesota, Jackson said Floyd talked at great length about his journey to create better opportunities for himself.\nMinneapolis ex-officer who knelt on George Floyd's neck is in custody and charged with murder\n\"The last time i talked to him was about a year ago and every conversation we had in that year was about bettering ourselves and being better fathers,\" Jackson said. \"That's all he talked about.\"\nFloyd is a father to two daughters, the youngest is 6, according to Jackson.\n\"I want justice for his kids,\" he said. \"I want his kids to be taken care of.

It was Floyd. And that's when it hit me, it hit me hard,\" Thunstrom told CNN affiliate WCCO.\nFloyd would help clean up after the bar had closed and was a \"very nice guy and really good with customers,\" according to Thunstrom.\n\"He stood up for people, he was there for people when they were down, he loved people that were thrown away,\" Courteney Ross, Floyd's other half, told WCCO. \"We prayed over every meal, we prayed if we were having a hard time, we prayed if we were having a good time.\"\nPeople who didn't know Floyd are outraged, too\nAnger over Floyd's death goes beyond his family and friends.

In Washington, DC, police released tear gas and fired rubber bullets at protesters near the White House to make way for President Trump to pose outside of a nearby church while holding a bible. His photo opportunity sent ripples of disbelief through the faith community. In New York City, widespread looting in upscale neighborhoods amounted to what one CNN correspondent called \"anarchy.\" Los Angeles and New York City have both imposed the harshest curfews the cities have seen in decades. Meanwhile, the demonstrations have gone global. People gathered in London, Amsterdam, Berlin, Rio de Janeiro and other cities in a show of solidarity with Black Lives Matter activists.\nCuomo reacts to Trump holding Bible for photo-op: Open it! 04:11\n2. Military \nDeclaring himself the \"president of law and order,\" President Trump has vowed to return order to American streets using the military if widespread protests continue. During a speech yesterday, the President said he would invoke the Insurrection Act, an 1807 law that allows a president to deploy the US military to suppress civil disorder. Some military leaders have expressed concern over his vow, saying it sets a dangerous precedent. More than 17,000 members of the National Guard are already standing ready to support local law enforcement across 23 states and Washington, DC. The Trump Administration also tapped 200 to 250 military personnel to ostensibly provide security in the nation's capital.\nDon Lemon: This was all a show 03:19\n3. George Floyd autopsy \nBoth an independent autopsy and a medical examiner's report have deemed George Floyd's death a homicide, but they differ over what caused it. Experts hired by Floyd's family concluded he died of \"asphyxiation from sustained pressure\" when his neck and back were compressed by Minneapolis police officers. They also said Floyd was dead within four minutes after he was held to the ground. The medical examiner's office, however, concluded Floyd didn't suffocate, but rather died of heart failure brought on by the incident. Floyd will be laid to rest on June 9th, and boxer Floyd Mayweather will reportedly pay for the funeral.\nIndependent George Floyd autopsy differs from state's version 02:54\n4.

These were patients who were hospitalized, but not sick enough to need oxygen from a ventilator. It's a positive development, but outside experts aren't calling it a game changer quite yet.

Zuckerberg said that though he personally had a \"visceral negative reaction\" to Trump's rhetoric, he also felt Facebook had a commitment to free expression.

George Floyd\nMore protests ripped through the Minneapolis area as anger grows over the death of George Floyd, the unarmed black man who died this week after a confrontation with police. Smoke and orange flames filled the night sky as protesters set ablaze the city's 3rd Police Precinct, the closest police hub to where Floyd was shown on video with an officer kneeling on his neck before he died. The National Guard has been called in, and the mayor says more than 170 businesses have been damaged -- with at least five buildings still on fire in the past hour. The four officers involved in the arrest have been fired, and protesters also gathered in New York, Denver, Phoenix, Memphis and elsewhere to demand their prosecution. Meanwhile, we're learning the officer who had his knee on Floyd had 18 prior complaints filed against him, though it's not clear what those were. And surveillance video from nearby businesses appears to contradict police claims that Floyd resisted arrest.\nVideo shows Minneapolis officer kneeling on black man's neck 03:01\n2. Twitter\nIn a late-night tweet, President Trump described the Minneapolis protesters as \"thugs\" and threatened to send in the military, writing, \"when the looting starts, the shooting starts.\" Twitter flagged his tweet for \"glorifying\" violence, a move that likely fueled Trump's ire with the platform just hours after he unveiled his executive order aimed at limiting the power of social media companies over posted content. Twitter earlier this week called two of the President's tweets \"potentially misleading.\" The executive order reinterprets a law that shields web sites and tech companies from lawsuits, and Trump says it's aimed at defending free speech and preventing censorship. There's just one problem: Legal experts say the order could infringe upon the free speech of social media companies instead and would likely face a boatload of legal challenges if it were implemented.\nTwitter labels Trump tweet, says it violates platform's rules 03:12\n3. Coronavirus task force\nThe White House's coronavirus task force is fading out, even as deaths in the US just passed 100,000. The group of doctors and high-ranking administration officials met several days a week at the height of the pandemic, and rarely a day went by without seeing public health experts like Drs. Deborah Birx, Anthony Fauci and Surgeon General Jerome Adams on TV. But now, the task force only meets about once a week, and high-profile medical experts are far less visible. One administration official says there just aren't as many daily decisions to make. Plus, the Trump administration has said for weeks it wants to focus more on reopening the economy.\nDr. Birx: These areas still show high numbers of positive tests 03:16\n4. Pennsylvania\nPennsylvania state House Democrats are accusing Republican leaders of keeping a lawmaker's positive coronavirus test from them for a whole week and withholding the fact that a handful of GOP state leaders were self-quarantining as a result. Republican state Rep. Andrew Lewis confirmed he tested positive for Covid-19 on May 20 and said he was working to notify anyone he had contact with while in the Capitol. But his Democratic colleagues say they didn't find out about Lewis' results until he announced his diagnosis publicly on Wednesday, which was a problem since they all work so closely together. Like many states, the legislature is debating how to open the state and also what kind of safety measures lawmakers should undertake.\nPA lawmaker accuses GOP leaders of silence on positive Covid-19 test 02:43\n5. Economy\nWe knew the economy was in bad shape, but new research from the Bureau of Economic Analysis shows the first quarter was even worse than originally reported. US gross domestic product, the broadest measure of the American economy, shrank by an annualized rate of 5% between January and March, a little bit higher than previously estimated. Much of the decline was driven by a sharp drop-off in consumer spending -- especially on, of all things, elective health care procedures. But believe it or not, economists say this worse-than-worst scenario could be somewhat good news for the second quarter, since a lot of negative adjustments to things like product demand have already been made. Still, the economy is likely to have a historically terrible summer.\nAnother 2.1 million Americans file for unemployment benefits 01:11\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\nNetflix isn't sending films or talent to festivals or awards shows this year\nRemember awards shows?

He was quickly fired from the department where he had worked since 2001, and amid national protests, was eventually charged with second-degree murder. Three other officers involved with the incident were also fired and face felony charges.\nBut Chauvin still stands to benefit from a pension partially funded by taxpayers. While a number of state laws allow for the forfeiture of pensions for those employees convicted of felony crimes related to their work, this is not the case in Minnesota.\nDerek Chauvin, 44\nThe Minnesota Public Employees Retirement Association confirmed to CNN that 44-year-old Chauvin would remain eligible to file for his pension as early as age 50, though it would not provide details on the specific amount he would receive. Chauvin's attorney declined to comment. Retirement plan officials said that employees terminated voluntarily or for cause are eligible for future benefits unless they choose to forfeit their future benefit and receive a refund of all their contributions made during their employment.\n\"Neither our Board nor our staff have the discretion to increase, decrease, deny or revoke benefits,\" a spokeswoman said. \"Any changes to current law would need to be done through the legislative process.\"\nWhat should we investigate next?\nEmail Blake Ellis and Melanie Hicken\nWhile a number of factors are used to calculate pension benefits, Chauvin would likely be eligible for annual payments in the ballpark of $50,000 a year or more if he chose to start receiving them at age 55, according to a CNN analysis based on Chauvin's tenure, 2019 payroll data, contract details, pension plan guidance and Minneapolis Police Department salary schedules. The benefits could stretch to $1.5 million or more over a 30-year period, not including any cost of living increases. Chauvin's annual payments could be even higher if he received significant amounts of overtime in prior years.\nTwo of the other officers charged in the death of Floyd were rookies, but a third also appears eligible to receive pension benefits from his time with the department, according to employment records released by the city. The Minneapolis Mayor's Office, Police Department and the local police union did not respond to CNN's requests for comment.\nPublic pensions are paid for through a combination of contributions from taxpayer-funded local governments and workers themselves, as well as investment returns. Public safety pensions are typically some of the most generous and have caused local and state budgets to balloon around the country.\nRelated: DOJ all but abandons broad police investigations\nBut they are almost impossible to reduce or take away from workers who have been promised them in public employment contracts, and police unions have fought hard to protect worker pensions. Officers also usually pay some of their own salaries into the funds and typically receive their pensions in lieu of Social Security.\nAmid growing calls across the country to defund police departments and better distribute the money to social services, such as youth and community development and mental health treatment, pensions will likely prove to be a flashpoint in the ongoing debate.\nMinneapolis demonstrators have called to defund the Minneapolis Police Department.\nThe laws governing whether pensions can be stripped from police accused of misconduct vary depending on the state. Less than half of states have laws that allow for pensions to be taken away from police who were convicted of any kind of felony, while some other states allow pensions to be taken away for specific crimes like corruption or sexual crimes against minors but not for the conviction of an officer for using excessive force, according to 2017 research published in the Journal of Law, Economics and Policy.\nBut even these laws wouldn't touch the many officers accused of police brutality who are never convicted or even charged with a crime. Many were also passed in the past decade and usually wouldn't apply to officers hired before the laws were enacted, researchers noted.\n\"Pension forfeiture for misconduct is pretty rare,\" said D. Bruce Johnsen, a law professor at George Mason University and one of the authors of the research.\n\"With this terrible tragedy it might be a good time to push in this direction,\" he added, saying that the specific situations that would allow for forfeiture would have to be carefully defined.\nWhat should we investigate next?

The CDC now says tests used to determine if people have been infected in the past with Covid-19 might be wrong up to half the time. This can be especially dangerous if the test results in a false positive, leading people to believe they have been infected in the past and may be immune (it's still not clear whether a past infection means someone can't get the virus again). Regardless, the CDC says the antibody tests aren't accurate enough to use to make important policy decisions, like figuring out when people should return to work. Health officials or providers using antibody tests need to use the most accurate ones they can find and might need to test people twice, the CDC says.\nHow antibodies protect us from viruses 01:37\n2.

Trump said in a tweet this week that Cooper is \"unable to guarantee\" that the convention arena can be safely filled to capacity as the pandemic rolls on. However, GOP officials have repeatedly said they are open to virtual or online options and haven't yet submitted a plan to Charlotte leaders for how the gathering, set for late August, would be held safely in person.

George Floyd memorial\nFamily and friends gathered yesterday to remember the life of George Floyd during the first of many events planned in his memory, as protesters around the country took to the streets for a 10th night. The Rev. Al Sharpton, who delivered a eulogy, also announced plans for a March on Washington in late August. The march will be led by families of black people killed by police and is intended to coincide with the anniversary of the historic 1963 civil rights demonstration. Meanwhile in Washington, workers have put up a new line of fencing around the White House, ostensibly in preparation for another weekend of demonstrations in Floyd's name.\nHide Caption\n53 of 53\nPhotos: Remembering George Floyd\nPallbearers bring George Floyd's casket into the Fountain of Praise church in Houston on Tuesday, June 9.

Ahmaud Arbery\nA Georgia Bureau of Investigation agent testified that Ahmaud Arbery's killer used a racial epithet after fatally shooting him in February. According to the testimony, William Bryan, a defendant in the case, told police he heard Travis McMichael hurl a profane slur at Arbery, who had been out for a jog, after McMichael shot him three times with a shotgun. The investigator also said the three men charged in Arbery's death engaged in an elaborate chase with the unarmed black man, hitting him with a truck as he tried to escape them. Attorneys for the three men involved say they did nothing illegal. \nAhmaud Arbery's mother says she's 'speechless' about new claim 03:06\n3. Coronavirus \nTwo major medical journals have retracted separate coronavirus studies over data concerns. Data used in the studies came from the same international registry, and auditors couldn't get all the information needed to verify it. One study found that Covid-19 patients treated with the drugs hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine were more likely to die or suffer dangerous side effects. Still, other studies have come to similar conclusions. Meanwhile, the US recorded 1,000 more coronavirus deaths yesterday, bringing the nationwide toll to more than 108,000. Here's a small piece of heartening news, though: A new study suggests 10 people who were home sick with Covid-19 may have found relief with famotidine, an ingredient in common over-the-counter heartburn remedies like Pepcid. The results may lead to further studies of the drug. \nCovid-19 cases may rise as protests in US continue 02:30\n4. Anti-lynching bill \nSparks flew on the Senate floor over a bill that would make lynching a federal crime. Republican Sen. Rand Paul wanted to add an amendment to the bill that would narrow the scope of crimes that fall under its penalties. Democratic Sens. Cory Booker and Kamala Harris mounted an emotional opposition, saying the move would weaken the measure. Booker also formally objected to Paul's request, saying the bill \"would speak volumes for the racial pain and the hurt of generations.\" Paul has been holding up the popular bipartisan legislation. \nPaul holds up anti-lynching bill.

These latest pacts will give Australia and India access to each other's bases for logistical support. They will also make it easier to conduct complex military exercises with other nations in the maritime region, like the US.

Here's why", "published_date": "2020-05-28", "text": "(CNN)George Floyd's death has raised new questions about a potentially dangerous method of restraint: the knee-to-neck maneuver.\nFloyd, a 46-year-old black man, was held down with a knee as he protested that he couldn't breathe. The FBI is investigating the incident, which drew widespread condemnation of the officers, who were fired this week, after a video showing part of the encounter circulated on social media.\nThe knee-to-neck move is banned by several major metropolitan police departments, but Minneapolis police allow police to restrain suspects' necks if they're aggressive or resisting arrest. Floyd was unarmed and handcuffed when he was pinned to the ground.\nSome law enforcement experts say the move is dangerous and unnecessary. Here's why.\nIt could cause injury\nDepending on the way someone's head is positioned and the weight of the person applying pressure to their neck, the knee-to-neck maneuver can cause significant damage, said Seth Stoughton, an associate professor of law at the University of South Carolina.\nStoughton, co-author of \"Evaluating Police Uses of Force,\" identified three ways officers can cause potential injury using the knee-to-neck method.\nThe first, he said, is keeping suspects in the prone position, meaning they lie face-down with their hands cuffed behind their backs, for an extended period of time. It's a dangerous position, Stoughton said, because it's known to cause what's called positional asphyxia.\nSomeone in that position can draw enough breath to gasp or speak in spurts, but they can't breathe fully, so they gradually lose oxygen and fall unconscious.\nGeorge Floyd's brother called him a \"gentle giant\" who moved to Minneapolis to improve his life.\nStoughton, who is a former officer, said police departments emphasize keeping someone in the prone position just long enough to restrain them, then take them out of it either by rolling them onto their side, sitting them up or having them stand.\nAnother potential injury involves the placement of pressure. A great deal of pressure and weight on a suspect's neck can cause fatal damage.\nIn his book on use of force, Stoughton wrote, \"Officers should avoid putting their body weight on the subject's neck or head; the pressure of such a position can fracture the hyoid bone or cervical spine, depending on the position of the subject's head.\"\nFinally, any officers involved in this maneuver must closely monitor the suspect's well-being, he said. Kneeling on their neck for an extended period of time could be fatal.\nPhotos: A racial reckoning in America\nThe maneuver is 'not a neck restraint'\nThe Minneapolis Police Department allows arresting officers to use two types of neck restraints on a subject, but only officers trained in them can use them, according to the department's Policy & Procedure Manual.\nConscious neck restraint involves putting light pressure on the subject's neck with an arm or leg without cutting off their airway, and unconscious neck restraint puts enough pressure on a subject to make them lose consciousness without killing them, according to the manual.\nWhen African Americans are killed by police, these lawyers get a phone call\nBoth can only be conducted when a subject is resisting arrest, per the policy, and unconscious neck restraint is allowed only when subjects are aggressively resisting and can't be subdued in another manner.\nThe method used to restrain Floyd doesn't fit neatly into either of those categories, Stoughton said.\n\"This is not a neck restraint,\" he said of the position Floyd was held in during his arrest. \"It's not just putting pressure on someone's neck. It's really dangerous.\"\nThe Minneapolis Police Department didn't return CNN's requests for comment.\nPolice aren't usually taught the move in training\nThe choice of restraint didn't fall in line with what police are taught in training, said Montgomery County Police Captain Sonia Pruitt.\n\"You use the force necessary to have someone comply and take them into custody,\" Pruitt, who is chairwoman of the National Black Police Association, said. \"This man was already in handcuffs and already on the ground. (Restraining him) was total excessive force.\"\nPruitt said a few years ago she started asking members of other police departments whether they'd been taught the knee-to-neck method of restraint because she'd seen it being repeatedly used, particularly with black suspects.\nLemon: Imagine how inaction impacts your friends of color 09:21\nShe said almost everyone she talked with denied that they were trained in the maneuver because of the high risk of injury.\nCNN's Ray Sanchez, Joe Sutton and Artemis Moshtaghian contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/04/us/five-things-june-4-trnd/index.html", "headline": "5 things to know for June 4: George Floyd, protests, coronavirus, stimulus, oil spill", "published_date": "2020-06-04", "text": "Get '5 Things' in your inbox\nIf your day doesn't start until you're up to speed on the latest headlines, then let us introduce you to your new favorite morning fix.

Derek Chauvin, who pressed his knee into the unarmed black man's neck, was charged with a new, more serious count of second-degree murder. The three other officers at the scene during his killing have now been charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter. The Floyd family called the new charges a \"bittersweet\" development. Meanwhile, a ninth night of protests unfolded across the country with demonstrations that were largely more peaceful than previous evenings.\nState AG explains why it's hard to convict police officers 02:16\n2. Protest response\nElite former military leaders have issued unprecedented levels of criticism against President Trump's response to the protests. Former Defense Secretary James Mattis said in a statement that the President doesn't even try to unite the country and that the American people need to find a way forward without relying on his leadership. Retired Gen. John Allen criticized Trump's photo op in front of a church during the protests, saying it was trying to use religion to gloss over an abuse of First amendment rights. Other senior military and political figures, including former Joint Chiefs Chairman Mike Mullen and former President Jimmy Carter, have also spoken out against Trump's rhetoric and threats of force against Americans.\nFormer Defense Secretary Mattis: Trump tries to divide us 04:51\n3. Coronavirus \nAlmost 20,000 new coronavirus cases were identified yesterday in the US, even as states are working toward fully reopening. Wednesday also saw almost 1,000 more deaths, pushing the death toll in the US past 107,000. However, Dr. Anthony Fauci has said keeping schools closed in the fall -- once thought to be a strong, if reluctant possibility -- may not be necessary for all communities. Meanwhile, the virus is still surging overseas. Brazil and Mexico both announced record numbers of Covid-19 deaths, and Pakistan has now recorded more cases than China, where the virus originated.\nCovid-19 cases may rise as protests in US continue 02:30\n4. Paycheck Protection Program\nThe Senate has finally passed a Paycheck Protection Program reform bill that will give business owners more flexibility and time to use the loan money. Now, all the bill needs is President Trump's signature. The measure extends from eight to 24 weeks the time businesses have to use the money to qualify for loan forgiveness. It also lowers the amount of loan money businesses must spend on payroll costs, opening up the funds for other uses. The Paycheck Protection Program has been hampered by several glitches and shortfalls, but businesses are still clamoring for the funds it offers.\nSome small businesses are frustrated with PPP rules 02:12\n5. Russia oil spill\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has ordered a state of emergency in the Siberian city of Norilsk after 20,000 tons of diesel fuel spilled in a nearby river from a power station. Environmental groups describe catastrophic damage and say the level of contaminants in nearby waterways has increased tens of thousands of times over. The power station's employees initially tried to contain the spill on their own, waiting two days before reporting it.

George Floyd\nGeorge Floyd will be laid to rest today in Houston as ongoing protests spurred by his death in police custody are putting pressure on politicians to effect real change. House Democrats put forth sweeping legislation aimed at cracking down on police brutality and recording misuse of force, the first concrete step toward action from Washington as a national movement emerges. The increased attention to the Black Lives Matter movement and racial parity is already changing the landscape in other industries. Four top media editors have resigned in recent days over issues of diversity and how people of color are treated at their companies.\nHide Caption\n53 of 53\nPhotos: Remembering George Floyd\nPallbearers bring George Floyd's casket into the Fountain of Praise church in Houston on Tuesday, June 9.

Police reform\nPowerful police unions across the country are digging in as political and public attention shifts toward reform. Police unions in the US wield significant political power and enjoy higher membership rates than many other unions, which could lead to significant political clashes as cities explore changes to police departments. Cities like Minneapolis, Los Angeles and New York are already making changes, but leaders of other cities like Atlanta and Houston say there are other ways to address issues raised by recent events. In Florida, a chapter of the Fraternal Order of Police said it is open to hiring officers who have been fired or quit over alleged misconduct. Among those are the Buffalo 57, dozens of officers from the New York city who resigned after two officers were suspended after they were filmed pushing a 75-year-old protester to the ground.\nDemocrats propose legislation to reform police force 02:09\n3. Coronavirus\nThe World Health Organization says the spread of the coronavirus through asymptomatic carriers appears to be rare, upending a lot of assumptions about how the virus spreads. Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO's technical lead for coronavirus response, said data from detailed contact tracing programs -- that is, programs that track whom infected people come in contact with -- shows very few secondary infections caused by people with no symptoms. However, other experts point out there is a difference between truly asymptomatic carriers and people who haven't shown symptoms yet or have extremely mild ones. Meanwhile, 22 US states have seen their case numbers jump back up in recent days following reopenings and relaxed guidelines. Florida alone has seen a 46% increase in cases over the last week.\nBlack light experiment shows how quickly a virus spreads 02:13\n4. Economy\nThe US is officially in a recession, economists have declared, but there's some good news, too. US stocks actually rallied on the announcement, pushing some indices to record highs and effectively erasing 2020 losses. Airline stocks are also rising as Americans prepare to take to the skies again, hopefully signaling an end to months of near-paralysis in the industry. All in all, this strong start to the week is a continuation of the remarkable turnaround for US stocks, which plunged into a bear market in mid-March. The Federal Reserve is set to meet tomorrow to discuss any future plans to shore up the economy. Some economists want the Fed to send interest rates below zero, which would be an aggressive move to kick-start a recovery.\nThe latest jobs report means the worst could be behind us 01:24\n5. North Korea\nNorth Korea has shut off all lines of communication with \"enemy\" South Korea. This includes shuttering several military-to-military hotlines, plus another phone line meant to directly connect North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in at a moment's notice. Officials in Pyongyang say they're giving Seoul the cold shoulder because North Korean defectors in South Korea flew balloons over the border carrying leaflets and SD cards, likely with information about the outside world.

George Floyd\nColonial slave trader statue torn down amid global protests 02:00\nFormer Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin will appear in court today exactly two weeks after George Floyd's death. Chauvin was the officer filmed on video with his knee on Floyd's neck before he died. He's been charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Also today, a third and final memorial service will be held for Floyd in Houston, where he grew up. These key developments come after a second weekend of protests that have gone global, and grown to encompass more issues of systemic racism and police brutality. In the UK, protesters toppled a statue of 17th-century slave trader Edward Colston, echoing several instances in the US where Confederate monuments have been defaced, removed or designated for removal. In Brazil, protesters gathered in support of Black Lives Matter, and to protest President Jair Bolsonaro's government, including its handling of the coronavirus pandemic.\n2. Police reform\nMinneapolis city council announces intent to defund police 02:17\nNine members of the Minneapolis City Council say they intend to defund and dismantle the city's police department. Council President Lisa Bender says they may shift police funding toward community-based strategies instead, and discuss how to eventually replace the current police force -- though Bender stressed that is \"not in the short term.\" The nationwide spread of anti-racist protests have led to calls to defund or outright abolish police departments, and some cities are considering other changes. In New York City, Mayor Bill De Blasio says the city will move some of its funding from the New York Police Department to youth and social services. Last week, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti agreed to slash between $100 million to $150 million from the Los Angeles Police Department's proposed $1.86 billion budget.\n3. Coronavirus\nManufacturer: Only enough remdesivir for 200K patients worldwide 02:24\nThe US government's current supply of remdesivir, the only drug known to work against Covid-19, will run out at the end of the month according to a US Department of Health and Human Services official. Gilead Sciences, the company that makes the drug, is ramping up to make more, but it's unclear how much will be available this summer. In the long term, the company plans to have more than 500,000 treatment courses available by October, and more than a million by December.Though it's not a cure, remdesivir has been shown to reduce hospital stays for some Covid-19 patients. Meanwhile, the global coronavirus death toll passed 400,000 this weekend, a sobering reminder that, despite waves of reopenings, the pandemic is an ongoing threat.\n4. Economy\nUS economy added 2.5 million jobs in May 01:06\nEmployers added 3.1 million jobs in May, giving an unexpected boost to a battered labor market. But state and local governments are still cutting jobs, which could kill any real economic momentum. Among the growth last month, these two levels of government actually slashed more than half a million jobs. One analytics firm predicts 3 million more state and local jobs could be at risk in coming months, including first responders and in areas like social services, sanitation, health care, education and municipal services like libraries and parks. And while the economy might be doing better now, there may be more bad news around the corner. Economists believe a second wave of infections could deaden a rebound and put the American economy in new danger.\n5. South China Sea\nWhy it matters who owns the seas 03:48\nMaritime and military experts are worried that China is adopting increasingly forceful tactics in the South China Sea. The Asia Maritime Transparency Institute revealed Chinese and Malaysian ships were locked in a high-stakes standoff in the highly-contested area earlier this year. Beijing claims it was conducting \"normal activities in waters under Chinese jurisdiction,\" but Chinese vessels have been accused for years of hounding countries who try to explore in the areas of the South China Sea that China claims as its own. The Malaysia standoff was also one among many confrontational moves from the Chinese government in the region this year. The AMTI says these incidents could lead to larger conflicts with other powers in the area, including Malaysia or Indonesia.\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\nUFC Champion Conor McGregor is retiring\nAt least, for now.

George Floyd\nSee police officers kneel in solidarity with protesters 00:37\nProtests over the death of George Floyd have spread through the US for six straight days now, culminating in both peaceful demonstrations and violent, fiery clashes between police and civilians. Over the weekend, ugly scenes unfolded in cities from coast to coast. Video from New York City appears to show a New York City Police Department truck plowing into a crowd. In Minnesota, a man who drove a tanker truck through a crowd of protesters has been charged with assault. Journalists in multiple cities have been arrested or assaulted while covering the protests. Businesses and buildings have gone up in flames. Widespread injuries have been reported, including at least seven police officers hurt in Boston. In Detroit, a 21-year-old man was shot and killed during a protest, though police couldn't confirm the victim was participating at the time. As a result, at least 40 cities have imposed curfews, and National Guard members have been activated in 15 states and Washington, DC. \nMeanwhile, the former officer who was shown on video kneeling on Floyd's neck before he died has been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter -- two felonies where intent is a key element. Derek Chauvin's first court appearance is scheduled for June 8. \n2. Antifa\nVinograd: Trump's Antifa tweets spread chaos 02:11\nIn response to the widespread protests, President Trump tweeted the United States will designate Anifa as a terrorist organization. Antifa, which stands for anti-fascist, is a broad, decentralized group of people with liberal-leaning beliefs that do not conform with the traditional Democratic Party platform. There are several issues with this. Chiefly, current and former government officials have said it would be unconstitutional to designate First Amendment-protected activity inside the US as terrorism. The law does allow foreign groups to carry the designation, because they don't fall under the same protections. Many experts see the President's claim as posturing rather than policy. \n3. Coronavirus \nJohn King: This coronavirus statistic is frustrating 01:32\nThe CDC will resume regular press briefings on Covid-19 following a three-month absence amid discord between the agency and White House officials. The return to the public eye comes as the White House's own coronavirus task force is being phased out. There's been friction between the White House and the CDC ever since the agency botched an effort to distribute testing in early February, and then stressed the urgency of the coronavirus threat while the White House was attempting to downplay it. The global death toll from the virus now stands at 372,000, including more than 103,00 deaths in the US. \n4. World Health Organization\nO'Brien defends Trump decision to withdraw from WHO 03:19\nThe fast-moving developments over the weekend eclipsed an important piece of Friday afternoon news: President Trump announced he is cutting funding to the World Health Organization. This decision has sparked criticism and concern from health experts, US lawmakers and world leaders, who have questioned the wisdom of defunding the organization amid a pandemic. The WHO has been criticized for relying on official Chinese government figures about the virus -- numbers which many officials doubt are accurate. \n5. G7 summit\nThis month's G7 summit has officially been postponed after it became clear that an in-person meeting of the world leaders would be nearly impossible in the current pandemic climate. President Trump has also said he wants to invite additional countries to the summit, including Russia, South Korea, Australia and India, which would take additional time and logistics to pull off. National security adviser Robert O'Brien said those countries have handled the pandemic \"incredibly well,\" and the President likely thinks their participation would be useful. The meeting has now been moved to September. \nBREAKFAST BROWSE\nIt's Pride Month\nThere won't be any parades or big gatherings, but Pride will go on.\nFishermen in Hawaii caught two yellowfin tuna totaling 220 pounds -- and used them to feed health care workers\nNow that's sharing your bounty.\nA 103-year-old woman beat Covid-19, and had an ice cold beer to celebrate\nWhen you're 103 and kick Covid to the curb, you can drink whatever you want.\nThe pandemic isn't the only thing that's shaken the world this year\nWe're only halfway through 2020, but it feels like about 10 years' worth of stuff has happened.

It was a spark that kicked off protests across the United States, many devolving into confrontations with police, damage to property, fires, looting and arrests.\nMayor Bill de Blasio said Monday that the New York police officer who appeared to draw his weapon on a crowd \"should have his gun and badge taken away from him today.\" An investigation is being done \"immediately\" and will determine larger consequences.\nThree videos piece together the final moments of George Floyd's life\n\"It is not the place of an officer to pull a gun in the middle of a crowd knowing there are peaceful protesters in that crowd,\" he said. \"That is unacceptable, that is dangerous.\"\nThe video the mayor referenced was obtained by the Gothamist.

At a time when we need leadership the most, police officers know we are completely alone.\"\nVideo taken Saturday captured an NYPD vehicle facing a barrier blocking protesters as several items including trash and bottles were thrown at it. The vehicle then appears to drive into the crowd, knocking down the barrier and protesters behind it, as people scream.\nPolice Commissioner Dermot Shea over the weekend said he does not like what he saw on the video, but looks at the situation \"fairly.\" What he saw was more akin to a \"mob\" than a protest, he added. \"A protest does not involve surrounding and ambushing a marked police car and putting my officers and my detectives' lives at risk.\"\nA law enforcement official describing the incident said protesters hurled a brick and water bottles and placed a flaming bag on top of the car in Brooklyn. It was when the officers noticed the bag was on fire and on top of the car that they hit the gas, the official said.\nProtests continue for a sixth night across America 05:23\n\"This was an extremely abhorrent situation and there were extenuating circumstances I believe because of incidents that had happened earlier,\" de Blasio said Monday. \"It is still not acceptable for our officers to ever drive into a crowd.\"\nCuomo said Monday that if he was just an average person \"from Queens,\" his hometown, \"I would say it would be simple -- that guy should be fired,\" referencing the officer who drove into a crowd. \"As governor,\" he added, \"there's laws, there's processes.\"\nCity officials have acknowledged \"horrible\" and \"vile\" acts against police in recent days, with three protesters facing federal charges for alleged use of Molotov cocktails at a police vehicle.\nThe mayor Monday said the instances of police acting inappropriately are \"rare.\"\nCNN previously reported an NYPD officer is being investigated for an \"aggressive push\" captured on camera during Friday night protests, according to a separate law enforcement official.\nBystander Mohammad Mufleh Odeh says he and other protesters were walking in Brooklyn and happened to be filming when they caught the officer push the woman. It's unclear what happened between the officer and the woman before the incident was captured on camera.\nWhile videos of police conduct are under investigation, others that surfaced struck a tone of solidarity between protesters and police.\nShea commented on images of NYPD officers kneeling with and hugging protesters Sunday during a march, tweeting, \"We need more of this, to see and hear each other, to work together, to recognize that our differences are our strength.\"\n\"This is how change begins,\" Cuomo tweeted of the same event.\nDe Blasio, referencing that video, said Monday such acts and strides in community policing are \"how we are going to overcome this moment, and move forward.\"\nCNN's Mark Morales contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/12/us/tiffany-haddish-george-floyd-protests/index.html", "headline": "Tiffany Haddish weighs in on George Floyd protests: 'You shouldn't be scared to be in America'", "published_date": "2020-06-13", "text": "(CNN)Actress Tiffany Haddish can't even drive through Beverly Hills without getting stopped, she told CNN's Suzanne Malveaux in an emotional interview Friday.\n\"And I got a Tesla,\" she said.\nThe actress was out with protesters Friday outside of Hollywood's Laugh Factory in Los Angeles.

Reynolds began sharing a live video on Facebook.\nHer Livestream captured Yanez yelling, \"I told him not to reach for it!\" and a bleeding Castile saying, \"I wasn't reaching.\" Castile's fully loaded gun was found in his shorts pocket after his death.\nCastile's death garnered widespread attention -- and sparked nationwide protests over the use of force by police -- after his girlfriend's video went public.\nYanez was acquitted in June 2017 of one count of second-degree manslaughter and two counts of intentional discharge of a firearm that endangers safety. He testified that he feared for his life and believed Castile was pulling his own gun from his pocket.

The Black Lives Matter movement and other groups drew national attention to the shooting.\nThe protests were largely peaceful, but turned violent when counter-protesters shot and injured activists occupying the police station. Three white men were arrested. The shooter, Allen \"Lance\" Scarsella, was convicted in 2017 of 12 felony counts, ranging from assault to rioting, and sentenced to 15 years in prison, WCCO reported. Two other men pleaded guilty to lesser charges and received sentence of probation and some jail time.\nUnrest mounts across multiple US cities over the death of George Floyd\nIn 2016, a police internal investigation concluded the two officers involved in the Clark shooting did not violate department policies and would not face discipline.\nThe officers, Mark Ringgenberg and Dustin Schwarze, were cleared to leave desk duty and resume policing.\nThe US Justice Department declined to prosecute the officers, saying it found \"insufficient evidence\" for criminal civil rights charges. Minnesota's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) concluded the officers acted in self-defense and would not face criminal charges.\nSchwarze shot Clark only after Ringgenberg scuffled with the young man, according to the BCA findings. Clark allegedly took control of the officer's gun and Ringgenberg told Schwarze to open fire.\nClark died at a hospital one day after being shot.\nPolice reports and subsequent investigations said Clark had attacked his girlfriend the day of the shooting. Clark also interfered with paramedics attempting to transport her to the hospital and refused officers' demands to remove his hands from his pockets, according to Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman, who announced charges Friday in connection with Floyd's death.\nTerence Franklin\nOn May 10, 2013, Terence Franklin, 22, was shot to death by members of a Minneapolis police SWAT team in the basement of a Minneapolis house, according to MPD 150, a collective of researchers, artists and activists who want the city police department dissolved.\nFranklin was suspected of burglarizing a home, MPD 150 and WCCO reported.\nWhat protesters say is fueling their anger\nPolice said he was shot and killed after a struggling with SWAT officers and wounding two of them, the station reported.\nIn the basement, police said Franklyn broke away from an officer, grabbed a police submachine gun and shot two officers in the legs, MPD 150 reported. Two other officers fatally shot Franklyn.\nThe death led to months of protests, according to WCCO. A grand jury cleared the officers of any wrongdoing.\nIn 2014, Franklin's family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the city and the police, WCCO reported.\nThe family claimed the police's actions that day were racially motivated and excessive, according to the station. The lawsuit said Franklin was shot after putting up his hands and surrendering.\nIn February, the Minneapolis City Council settled the federal lawsuit with Franklin's family for $795,000, WCCO reported."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/17/us/freddie-gray-george-floyd-comparison/index.html", "headline": "The outcome of the Freddie Gray case is a cautionary tale for prosecutors in the George Floyd case", "published_date": "2020-07-17", "text": "(CNN)\"I can't breathe,\" George Floyd said to Minneapolis Police officers on Memorial Day while in custody, with an officer's knee pressing on his neck.

Gray died from his injuries one week later.\nMany legal experts, including the Hennepin County attorney who prosecutes cases in Minneapolis, drew the comparison between the Gray case and the Floyd case. At the most basic level, in both cases, a Black man was arrested for a minor offense and became unresponsive while in custody. Their encounters both turned out to be fatal.\nFreddie Gray and George Floyd had fatal encounters with police about five years apart.\nProtesters demanding justice filled streets across the country for days, and within ten days of their deaths the officers involved were arrested.\nThe Gray case turned out to be a failed prosecution: None of the six Baltimore officers arrested were convicted.\nThe trial for the four now former Minneapolis police officers, Derek Chauvin, Tou Thao, Thomas Lane, and J.

Brian Rice, tells CNN it was \"inconceivable that an investigation of this magnitude could be conducted so quickly in a careful and prudent manner.\"\nThree days after Floyd's last breath, under immense pressure to charge the Minneapolis officers involved, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman was of the same mindset, saying prosecutors in Minnesota did not want to make the mistake that Baltimore did by charging too quickly.\nThis haunting song features the last words of unarmed black men\n\"I will just point to you the comparison to what happened in Baltimore and the Gray case,\" Freeman told reporters at a press conference. \"There was a rush to charge, it was a rush to justice. . . I will not rush to justice. I'm going to do this right.\"\nThe next day, Freeman would announce Chauvin's arrest, but Mosby took issue with his take.\n\"Saying that there was a 'rush to charge, a rush to justice' in the Freddie Gray case is demonstrably false,\" Mosby said in a statement.\nWhile there are similarities, legal experts point to one obvious difference between the Floyd case and the Gray case which they say could lead to the conviction of at least one of the former Minneapolis police officers: the dramatic video.\nCell phone video captured then-Officer Chauvin pressing his knee on Floyd's neck while Floyd was on the ground outside a police vehicle. Floyd repeatedly said he couldn't breathe and was pronounced dead at a hospital.\nMaryland governor shares lessons from Freddie Gray's death 01:57\n\"The video is a tremendous difference obviously because we can all look at the video and make reasonable assumptions,\" Belsky said. \"The biggest difference between the Minneapolis case and the Freddie Gray case is that in the Freddie Gray case there was no video, which led people to speculate both ways.\"\nBut from experience Belsky issues a word of caution: The Floyd case is not a slam dunk.\n\"Every use of force case is different,\" Belsky said. \"They are not monolithic cases. Every one is different and has its own set of circumstances.\"\nRush for judgment?\nProtesters march in Minneapolis on May 26 after the killing of George Floyd.\nEach of the six officers arrested in the Gray case faced at least three charges at trial. All of them pleaded not guilty to every charge.\nBelsky's client, Rice, was charged with involuntary manslaughter, reckless endangerment and misconduct in office.\nWhen she announced the arrests, Mosby stood on the courthouse steps, telling the community \"no one is above the law.\"\nPeter Moskos, former Baltimore Police officer and associate professor in the Department of Law, Police Science and Criminal Justice Administration at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, believes Mosby \"heard the cry for justice\" five years ago and arrested the officers \"to placate the protesters and rioters.\"\nMoskos says the prosecutor \"never showed crime happened.\"\n\"It was a tragedy but it was a civil issue,\" he said.\nNew police body camera footage reveals George Floyd's last words were 'I can't breathe'\nIn Minneapolis, ex-officer Chauvin was arrested the day after prosecutor Freeman's news conference and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. In the days after Chauvin's arrest, protests ramped up as the probe continued into the three other officers.\nFive days after Chauvin's initial arrest, those officers were charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder. And Chauvin was additionally charged with second-degree murder.\nMinnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, who had been tapped by the governor to be lead prosecutor, told the Minneapolis community, \"I did not allow public pressure to impact our decision making process.\"\n\"We made these decisions based on the facts that we gathered...and made these changes based on the law that we think applies,\" Ellison said.\n'The lesson learned is that facts matter'\nBecause of the lack of video inside the police van there was always a mystery as to what actually happened to Gray's neck and spinal cord.\nCrime is surging in US cities. Some say defunding the police will actually make it fall\nProsecutors asserted it was because Officer Caesar Goodson was driving the van erratically at a reckless speed. But defense attorney Catherine Flynn, who represented Officer Garrett Miller, says the evidence never supported the prosecution's theory \"that he was killed because of a rough ride. There was never a shred of evidence to support that theory throughout all of the litigation.\"\nThat opened up the door for the defense to claim that by intentionally thrusting his head on the van's walls and by standing up in a moving vehicle Gray himself caused his fatal injuries.\nAs far as lessons learned from Baltimore, Belsky says Minneapolis prosecutors need to make sure they have a rock solid case.\n\"The Chauvin case may well be the case where it is more than warranted to charge and secure a conviction. But on the flip side there are cases like the one we had in Baltimore that do not deserve to be charged and where the facts do not support a conviction ...The lesson learned is that facts matter and each case is different.\"\nThe evidence just wasn't there, judge said\nThe presiding judge for all of the Baltimore officer trials was Barry Williams, a former prosecutor who investigated police misconduct cases for the US Justice Department.\nIn three separate bench trials, Judge Williams acquitted Rice and Officers Goodson and Edward Nero on all charges, stating as part of the record that the prosecution had \"failed to meet its burden to show that the actions of the defendant rose above mere civil negligence.\"\nFlynn agreed with the judge's legal determination.\n\"The judge was extremely thorough and the state's legal theory simply didn't hold water,\" Flynn said. \"They were just wrong.\"\nA protester walks through tear gas on April 28, 2015, as police enforce a curfew after the funeral of Freddie Gray in Baltimore.\nOfficer William Porter's trial ended in a hung jury.

They're mandated to call a medic when requested. There is an affirmative duty and responsibility for colleagues if someone crossed the line, for them to go and inform folks about that.\"\nAnd as far as advice to the Minnesota defense attorneys who are beginning their journey as the Baltimore attorneys did five years ago, Belsky says: \"You have to recognize that there is a community that is legitimately hurt and distrustful of the police and you have to understand that and appreciate that.\n\"Don't try to change a community's perception based on a case.

It was a visceral and uncontrolled physical reaction. I couldn't stomach seeing a man gulping air like a fish \u2014 his face pushed flat on the hot, dirty pavement with a knee bearing down on his neck. It was painful to watch. Though of course nothing like the pain of the man experiencing such an act of sanctioned violence. That man was 46-year-old George Floyd.\nBut I'm a reporter and so I forced myself to watch it again and again. I did so a dozen times. I was trying to get all the words that were being said. I was counting the number of times Floyd told the officer, \"I can't breathe.\" The number of times bystanders begged police to get off his neck. The number of times he said, \"They gonna kill me.\" The one time he called out to his dead mama.\nMy job that day was to tell people about Floyd's final moments so I had to make sure I had the details right. But I hated doing it because I knew I was searing those images into my brain forever. Watching someone be tortured leaves you with a unique helplessness, especially when you know the ultimate outcome. Bile rose in my throat more than once. I retched as I watched.\nSara Sidner prepares to make a live report from the street where George Floyd was killed.\nIt was not the first time. There is a vicious cycle that makes it all the more disturbing. I know what comes next, I've done this for more than a decade. The video comes out, we break it down. I take it all in, and we go report to find out what happens. Each time I wonder if it will be the last. I also fear and wonder sometimes how soon the next one will be. What is enough? When is enough? Will this be the time that the people, the earth, and this country is moved?\nWhen I arrived on the streets of Minneapolis, protests were raging by people who had also watched that video. I felt the anger and sorrow myself but shoved it down to my toes so I could be a journalist with open eyes and an open mind. I walked the streets listening to people's hurt and outrage. Black people, Native people, Latino people, white people, immigrants and people from all walks of life.\nCNN's Sara Sidner: 'Zero' police presence as precinct burns 04:10\nI didn't have to try to understand their words. I could feel their devastated souls rip through my own.\n\"Where do I put my anger?\" a young black teenager asked me. I did not want to tell him that I push mine down to the bottom of my soul, because that's not good advice. I told him he'd have to figure out what works for him. But I said destroying things won't fix his anger. He promised he was just raising his voice, but he said the destruction all around, including the torching of the Third Precinct police station, was a message because no one was listening before and now even the powerful were listening.\nI abhor violence. I don't go to violent action-packed films. I can't deal with scary, tense horror flicks. My body can't handle it. I've seen too much of it in real life. I have covered wars and seen what remains after the bombs fall and bullets stop. My eyes cannot un-see the dead babies, the disfigured adults, the blank stares of war-torn people trying to find their way back to some semblance of a life. I can still see the faces of families mangled by war and terrorism in Libya, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, India, Pakistan, the Palestinian territories and Israel. I try to shut it all out, but it is futile. Seeing injustices and brutality against any of my fellow Americans in my own country is a special kind of torment. Seeing black and brown folks often taking the brunt of violence both by community members and at the hands of police can be unbearable.\nSidner describes 'chaos' at looted Target 03:48\nAs the days rolled on and the protests in Minneapolis grew, so did my sorrow. The destruction will make life so much harder for the all residents of the neighborhood where Floyd was killed, especially the elderly, or those without easy transportation. Two of their grocery stores, Target, and a fast food joint all gone in one block. The neighborhood was already deprived. Now it's a disaster zone. It is just another indignity to endure where they are mourning a terrible death in their streets.\nProtesters gather in front of a liquor store in flames near the Minneapolis Third Police Precinct, which was also gutted, in May during a protest over the death of George Floyd.\nOne evening, before sundown, I stood where George Floyd was killed, interviewing a black nurse who had helped treat a cyclist she said had been struck by a man driving a truck through a protest line.\nAt the end of the interview she said, \"Hey the chief is behind you. I think he's praying.\"\n\"The chief?\" I said, \"What chief?\" I turned around and there stood Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo. Well, I guess we missed the moment, I thought, but decided to go to try to talk to him. I was sure he wouldn't engage. Never have I ever been able to get a police chief to talk one-on-one so soon after an event where his officer or officers are accused of killing someone and sparking huge protests.\nMinneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo kneels at a memorial for George Floyd in south Minneapolis.\nBut this time was already different. I had never seen a chief go to the neighborhood where a police-involved killing had occurred while protests were raging. When I chased down the chief in Ferguson, Missouri, after the killing of Michael Brown, he was combative and defensive.\nBut here was Arradondo. So I told myself, \"Have an open mind, do not judge this situation. Just let it unfold.\" I do that a lot in this line of work. Remind myself I am there to listen and ask questions on behalf of the American public. This was about to be much more than just that.\nMy producer, Jason Kravarik, told our control room that we were going to try to talk to the chief, and it could be a moment to take live. Unbeknownst to us, anchor Don Lemon was having an emotional conversation with one of George Floyd's brothers, Philonise Floyd, and the Floyd family attorney Benjamin Crump at the same exact time. They had not yet spoken to Arradondo. And they had a question for the chief.\nAll of a sudden, I found myself in a unique position. I become a conduit between the police chief and a family suffering terrible pain because of the actions of his officers. I felt a weird kind of fear. The fear of letting someone down in their worst moments. The fear of getting it wrong. I would never forgive myself if I screwed this up. I just wanted to make sure I was conveying the true sentiments from the Floyd family to the chief so there was no miscommunication.\nWhat unfolded was remarkable. As we went live, I told the chief that we were on live with the family of George Floyd and he responded by removing his cap. The show of respect was the first sign that things were going to be real. No official canned remarks. No rehearsed lines. No nonsense.\nPolice chief on Floyd killing: This was a violation of humanity 05:19\nWords can't convey the tension and emotion that oozed onto the screen but you can watch it here. What I can say is afterward I broke down in tears. I walked away from the crowd, the chief and the spotlight and sat on a stoop and bawled.\nHours later as I continued to report from what became the people's memorial to George Floyd, a man from the neighborhood approached me. He told me he had immigrated to the US from Liberia after enduring two civil wars there. \"I just want you to know that your interview with the chief changed my mind about something,\" he said. \"I always thought police were against us. They were not human to me. They were uniforms that caused us trouble. I will never look at them the same way after the way that chief acted. He showed respect. I see that they are human after all.\"\nI went to the car and cried for the second time that day. After days of searing anger, a simple act of compassion and respect from someone in power to a suffering family was the thing that changed a man's mind.\nIt reinforced what I have always wanted to believe. Kindness is more powerful than rage. Compassion is mightier than anger. Understanding is the key to change.\nFlowers, signs and balloons are left at a makeshift memorial to George Floyd near the spot where he died.\nI have fought all my professional life as a journalist to separate my biases from my writing and my work. I have recently realized that it may be more honest to name those biases and explain how I am telling the story while at the same time forcing myself to remain objective and having editors help me get it right.\nI cannot say that I am not profoundly affected by the sorrow of my fellow human beings. It is crushing sometimes. But as well as having the desire to tell stories like all journalists do, I have a drive to do the hard things, to cover racism and hate in all its forms in the US.\nI never wanted to be the reporter who ONLY covered issues in the black community. I care about a thousand things and yet it is clear that the black American experience keeps showing up in my inbox and won't be ignored.\nGrowing up biracial in the 1970s made conversations about race unavoidable. My white mother was constantly asked if I was adopted or why my hair was so \"fuzzy.\" Later in life, one of the people around me got comfortable enough to use the N-word, only to tell me that they weren't talking about me, of course, because they said, \"I wasn't really black.\" My childhood in the South left with me with a lot of unanswered questions. I am still trying to answer one of those questions: Why do people hate each other because of their skin color? I have many responses. None of them suffice.\nPeople raise their fists in front of riot policemen during a protest at the Champ de Mars in Paris, with the Eiffel Tower in the background as part of worldwide \"Black Lives Matter\" protests in the wake of the death of George Floyd,\nAs a mixed-race woman, my color can be helpful and make me a target all at the same time. I blend in spaces all around the world and people refer to me as American. But in America I am never allowed to just be American. I am a black American. That's fine with me.\nOn the one hand, protesters sometimes believe I understand them because we likely have a shared experience. And they are correct. On the other hand, some police see me as a protester, another black face in the crowd even when I identify myself as a journalist. I know this, so I can name it and move on with my job. When I see violence on the part of protesters or police, I name that too. Police have a job to do. It is often dangerous and unpleasant. But how they do their jobs is important to investigate.\nIt was the same six years ago when I was standing in Ferguson, Missouri, watching the world around me be set on fire, literally and figuratively. The anger, the frustration, the sorrow and the calls to action after the shooting death of Michael Brown by officer Darren Wilson was the same. The protests lasted more than 100 days and I was there for much of it. The story became a part of my personal history as well as America's history.\nDemonstrators defied a curfew in the streets of Ferguson to protest against the police shooting of Michael Brown in August 2014.\nIn Ferguson I was initially met with hostility by protesters who felt the media was not portraying their side of the story fairly. I was cursed out live on the air for saying the protests had turned violent at times. I was hit in the head with a bottle or rock (never could figure out what) while covering the fires being set.\nOver time, the protesters and I seemed to come to an understanding that I was always going to say what I saw, but I would recognize the pain and reasons of those who wanted to burn it all down. The Ferguson and St. Louis County police could not have cared less if I and other journalists had a right to be there. Some did not treat us as people with constitutional rights to be there to bear witness.\nPolice are deployed to keep peace along Florissant Avenue in Ferguson, Missouri, in August 2014, a week after Michael Brown was shot and killed in the neighborhood, sparking violent protests.\nAfter the months of daily protests, I wondered if Ferguson would be the case that changed the world or at least American policing. It began with Brown being stopped for jaywalking in his own neighborhood. Minutes later he was shot to death by a police officer. The details were disputed but not that the city exploded. It was not just about Michael Brown's blood in the streets. The black and poor there were sick and tired of being over-policed. The endless ticketing for things like jaywalking and driving offenses, done not just for public safety but to pour money into the city and police department coffers at the expense of the people who could least afford it, as the Justice Department subsequently found.\nPolice officers arrest a demonstrator in Ferguson, Missouri, during protests following the death of Michael Brown in August 2014.\nIn Ferguson no video ever emerged of what happened between the officer and Michael Brown. A grand jury declined to indict Wilson and there was no agreement about what happened.\nThe people in the streets of Ferguson hoped for a change in American policing. But it did not happen. Instead, what came next felt like more punishment for people of color. We witnessed a sudden increase in activity in the racist chatrooms we monitor. There was a more public outpouring of an \"us against them mentality.\" Black Lives Matter vs. Blue Lives Matter vs All Lives Matter. Arguments ensued. People took sides. Politicians wavered and did not take action.\nA \"Black Lives Matter\" placard is seen behind caution tape during a peaceful protest in Washington against police brutality and the death of George Floyd.\nA few weeks before Brown's death, Eric Garner died in a police chokehold even after crying out, \"I can't breathe.\" A few months later, Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old boy, was shot and killed by a police officer who saw him with a toy gun. In 2015, I was in Baltimore reporting on protests after Freddie Gray died following an arrest and being put in a police van. Walter Scott was shot and killed while running away from a police officer in South Carolina. In November that year, I found myself at another police shooting of an unarmed black man, this time in Minneapolis. His name was Jamar Clark. For 18 days a few dozen residents gathered every day in front of the Third Precinct to protest his death and called for change.\nAll of the 2014 and 2015 cases of police killings of black men that sparked mass protests happened while America's first black president was in office. And African Americans weren't just dying at the hands of police. Dylann Roof massacred nine people at Bible study in a church in Charleston, South Carolina, simply because they were black. The marching and outrage seemed to drain from the streets and slow down by 2016. The attention turned to politics and a new force of personality: Donald Trump. White supremacists were emboldened more online and I could see that a physical manifestation would come, I just didn't know when or where.\nPhotos of the nine victims killed at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church are held up by congregants during a prayer vigil in Washington.\nIn August 2017, white supremacists and neo-Nazis marched openly on the streets of Charlottesville, Virginia. Counterprotesters turned out to challenge them and one, Heather Heyer, was killed and many more injured when a white supremacist drove his car deliberately into a crowd.\nCovering this hate and these losses could destroy my faith in humanity. Both Garner and Floyd were stopped for alleged non-violent crimes \u2014 selling untaxed cigarettes and allegedly using a counterfeit $20 bill. And yet both died violent deaths. Covering these are hard but I just try my damnedest to get to the truth. I won't always get it right, of course not. I will always be a work in progress and perfection in journalism does not exist. And I still have my faith in humanity.\nMinneapolis police chief: Floyd family will lead me forward 03:36\nI don't know why something has broken loose and made America and the world respond. Perhaps it is so many people seeing what I saw, the unbearable long minutes of suffering George Floyd had under the knee of a police officer. Perhaps it's been heightened by the isolation we have undergone as individuals facing the coronavirus.\nI have many questions, for myself, for the audience, for America. I hope to be there when the answers come.\nFamilies participate in a children's march in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement and national protests against police brutality in June in Brooklyn.\nWhat I do know is that George Floyd's death, and the country's reaction to it, is different. It has already created change within 10 days. Policy changes in policing are now the top priority in some states. Chokeholds and other potentially deadly restraints are being banned. Even Confederate flags are being removed from spaces including NASCAR events. Change is happening.

The pressure cut off blood flow to his brain, that autopsy determined.\nBut the medical examiner's office, in its report also released Monday, said that the cause of death is \"cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression.\" Cardiopulmonary arrest means Floyd's heart failed.\nThe medical examiner made no mention of asphyxiation.\nThe Hennepin County release says heart disease was an issue; the independent examiner didn't find that.\nA look at why ex-police officer Derek Chauvin is charged with third-degree murder\nThe county said that fentanyl and methamphetamine use were among \"significant conditions,\" but its report didn't say how much of either drug was in Floyd's system or how that may have contributed.\n\"Whether or not he was intoxicated or had medications in his system is irrelevant to the cause of death, which is homicide, which is death by the hand of another,\" Floyd family attorney Antonio Romanucci told CNN. \"The end result, which is George Floyd's death, would not be any different.\"\nFloyd, 46, was essentially \"dead on the scene\" on May 25, said Ben Crump, an attorney for the family.\nMultiple videos of Floyd's death show former police officer Derek Chauvin's knee on Floyd's neck, along with other officers kneeling on his back.\nThe officer had his knee on Floyd's neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds in total and two minutes and 53 seconds after Floyd was unresponsive, according to the criminal complaint against Chauvin, who faces charges in the death.\nHennepin County medical examiner says Floyd didn't suffocate\nThe independent autopsy's findings came after the Hennepin County Medical Examiner found \"no physical findings\" to \"support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation,\" according to a criminal complaint released by the Hennepin County Attorney's Office on Friday.\nThree videos piece together the final moments of George Floyd's life\nPreliminary autopsy results cited in the complaint involving Chauvin said combined effects of being restrained, any potential intoxicants in Floyd's system and his underlying health issues, including heart disease, probably contributed to the man's death.\nDr. Michael Baden, one of the independent medical examiners, said \"there is no other health issue that could cause or contribute to the death.\"\n\"Police have this false impression that if you can talk, you can breathe.

But Ventura and Orange Counties allowed citizens to go to the beach, as long as they adhered to a patchwork of guidelines and restrictions, including keeping parking lots closed to discourage outside visitors and limit crowds.\nSeeking relief from the heat, thousands crowded the beaches -- and photos quickly emerged of people packed under the sun in the sand, some not adhering to social distancing guidelines, others not sporting masks.\n\"It's a beautiful day,\" Frank Feerini, who was at Huntington Beach in Orange County, told CNN affiliate KABC on April 25. \"How can you keep anybody in?

The officer responded, \"Yes, you are technically entering an unauthorized area,\" but did not stop the protester as he proceeded past the line of officers and to the ocean.\nOrange County reported a 22% increase in coronavirus cases amid protests to reopen beaches.\nThe protest came on the heels of many similar nationwide protests -- in both red and blue states -- over stay-at-home orders. People grew concerned about the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, and demanded the states reopen, even as cases continued to rise and the virus was far from contained.\nAfter the standoff with Newsom, California allowed three cities -- including Huntington Beach -- to begin reopening its coastlines.\n\"I cannot impress upon people more that we're not going back to normal,\" Newsom said. \"It's back to a new normal, with adaptations and modifications until we get to immunity, until we get to a vaccine. We'll get there.\"\nDemanding justice in the streets\nAlmost one month later, as more states slowly began to reopen amid the pandemic, the nation was shaken by yet another incident that provoked outrage.\nHowever, this incident, unlike a global pandemic, felt familiar -- as the nation had seen such police brutality against black people many times before.\nFloyd, a 46-year-old unarmed black man, was killed at the hand of a Minneapolis police officer, who in a video is seen with his knee on Floyd's neck for over eight minutes.\nA check-cashing business burns during protests in Minneapolis on May 29, 2020.\nThe former officer, Derek Chauvin, was fired, along with three other officers, after outrage increased. Chauvin was charged Friday with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.\nSunday was the sixth day of protests nationwide. Demonstrators funneled their anguish in cities like Atlanta, New York and Washington into chants and signs of Floyd's last few words -- \"I can't breathe.\" While some protests were peaceful, others were marked by chaotic scenes of violence, smashed windows and vehicles set ablaze.\nFive hundred people participated in protests near the Pacific Coast Highway and Main Street in Huntington Beach on Sunday, the Huntington Beach Police Department said.\nThe protest was declared an unlawful assembly after protesters became violent with numerous assaults, and officers observed protesters with weapons such as pepper spray and various impact weapons, the department said.\n\"Multiple weapons including cinder blocks, weights and rocks were located hidden in several of our alleys in the downtown area, indicating a precursor to planned violence,\" police said in a statement.\nHuntington Beach Police said protesters were also blocking traffic on Pacific Coast Highway and refused to leave the area after being asked to do so by officers.\nAs of Sunday night, 17 suspects had been arrested in the city for various charges, police said.\nHuntington Beach joined at least 40 cities in imposing a curfew.

The new second-degree murder charge says he killed Floyd \"without intent\" in the course of committing assault in the third degree, according to an amended complaint.\nDerek Chauvin, J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao face charges in the death of George Floyd.\nThomas Lane and J. Alexander Kueng, who helped restrain Floyd, and Tou Thao, who stood near the others, were not initially charged.

Manslaughter and aiding and abetting manslaughter are punishable by up to 10 years in prison.\nGeorge Floyd died while in police custody May 25 in Minneapolis.\nTwo autopsies on Floyd determined that he died by homicide. Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo fired the four officers and said they were \"complicit\" in Floyd's death, and Floyd's family and protesters nationwide have called for them to be arrested and convicted for the killing.\nAccording to the video and the criminal complaint, Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd's neck as Floyd pleaded that he could not breathe, as witnesses protested that he was dying, and even as Lane twice asked to turn him onto his side. Still, Chauvin kept his knee in position for almost three minutes after Floyd became unresponsive, the complaint states.\nFamily says charges are bittersweet\nBenjamin Crump, an attorney for the Floyd family, said on Twitter that the family was gratified with the new charges.\n\"FAMILY REACTION: This is a bittersweet moment. We are deeply gratified that (Ellison) took decisive action, arresting & charging ALL the officers involved in #GeorgeFloyd's death & upgrading the charge against Derek Chauvin to felony second-degree murder,\" he said.\nStill, he said that he believes Chauvin should be charged with first-degree murder, which requires intent, and the charges only represent the first steps toward justice.\n\"We cannot celebrate because an arrest is not a conviction and we want justice,\" Crump told reporters on Wednesday. \"We want whole justice.\"\nIndependent autopsy and Minnesota officials say George Floyd's death was homicide\nCrump noted neither he or the family have reviewed the footage from the officers body cameras.\nAt the news conference, Ellison insisted that the protests did not influence the charges.\n\"I did not allow public pressure to impact our decision-making process,\" he said. \"We made these decisions based on the facts that we gathered since this matter occurred and made these charges based on the law that we think applies.\"\nEllison was appointed by Gov. Tim Walz to take over the case from Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman on Sunday.\nA former Democratic congressman, Ellison had cautioned against a rush to judgment, citing the difficulty of prosecuting police officers.\nOfficers are rarely charged with crimes for violence against black men, and even in those rare cases, juries have repeatedly shown an unwillingness to convict. The list of such failed cases is long.\nIn 2017, for example, the Minnesota police officer who fatally shot Philando Castile was found not guilty of second-degree manslaughter and intentional discharge of firearm that endangers safety.\n\"We're confident in what we're doing, but history does show that there are clear challenges here,\" Ellison said.\nWalz said in a statement that the new charges are a meaningful step.\n\"The charges announced by Attorney General Keith Ellison today are a meaningful step toward justice for George Floyd. But we must also recognize that the anguish driving protests around the world is about more than one tragic incident,\" he said.\n\"George Floyd's death is the symptom of a disease. We will not wake up one day and have the disease of systemic racism cured for us. This is on each of us to solve together, and we have hard work ahead.

This was after he pleaded with officers while sobbing as they attempt to walk him to the squad car.\nThe video seen by CNN shows that a big struggle ensues when officers Lane and Kueng attempt to put Floyd in the squad car. Kueng is physically trying to push Floyd in the car as Lane goes around to the other side of the vehicle and reaches in to try and pull him as Floyd is yelling throughout. This is the first \"I can't breathe\" we hear from Floyd through what sounded like a gargled breath.\nEventually Floyd falls out on Lane's side and it's at this point the other officers, Thao and Chauvin, show up on video, and then Chauvin, Kueng, and Lane work to restrain Floyd. This is when Floyd falls to the familiar location seen in the cell phone video, and about 11 minutes and 23 seconds into Lane's body camera Chauvin's knee goes on Floyd's neck.\nCrime is surging in US cities.

The report noted that there was no audio of the incident and the dash came in Chauvin's car was turned off.\nChauvin admitted that he did not check to see if the dash cam in his cruiser at the start of his shift and left a microphone in the squad car during the traffic stop, the report says. He received a letter of reprimand and a notice of suspension for the incident, the documents show.\nHis files also include recommendations that he be given the department's medal of valor for his actions in two incidents. One involved shooting a man who pointed a shotgun at officers and another involved shooting a man suspected of a violent domestic assault, according to the personnel file.\nWhen Chauvin applied for a job with the police department, he said he served in the US Army as a member of the military police and had worked as a custom protection officer for security services company. The files note Chauvin worked for McDonald's and another restaurant in the mid-1990's.\nChauvin was initially hired as a community service officer in January 2001 and served for about eight months before he was promoted to police officer, the personnel files show.\nJ.

Demonstrators also demand justice in the killings of Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky, and Ahmaud Arbery in Glynn County, Georgia.\nIn the most recent video showing Floyd's final moments, Officer J. Alexander Kueng is seen struggling with someone in the back seat of a police SUV. What happened isn't entirely clear from the video, but a police report says Floyd refused to get into a squad car during the May 25 encounter.\nKueng and Officers Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and Derek Chauvin have been fired. Chauvin -- who knelt on Floyd's neck for nearly eight minutes, according to a prosecutor's statement of probable cause -- faces charges of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. CNN has reached out to Chauvin's attorney and the Minneapolis police union for comment.\nHere is what the three videos show:\nVideo 1: The arrest\nThe first video, from a surveillance camera, shows Floyd in the driver's seat of a vehicle when Lane and Kueng approach. Lane goes to Floyd's window, while Kueng goes to the other side of the car, where a man is in the front seat and a woman is in the back, the video shows.\nEmployees of the Cup Foods across the street had reported Floyd tried to pass a counterfeit $20 bill, according to a prosecutor's statement of probable cause to charge Chauvin. Lane draws his weapon and points it at Floyd, demanding he show his hands, the statement says, but the gun is not visible in the video.\nFloyd puts his hands on the steering wheel and Lane holsters his gun, the statement says.\nSeconds later, Lane pulls Floyd out of the car, the video shows. Police allege Floyd \"actively resisted being handcuffed,\" according to the probable cause statement, but Floyd's vehicle is blocking the camera's view.\nNew surveillance video shows moments leading up to George Floyd's arrest 02:31\nKueng, who is conversing with the other passengers, walks around the car to assist Lane. Lane then addresses the passengers, who are out of the car, as Kueng walks Floyd across the sidewalk and sits him down on the ground, the video shows. Floyd appears uncomfortable as he walks.\nKueng talks to Floyd for about a minute and a half, hands his notebook to an unidentified officer who had just arrived in a Minneapolis Park Police SUV and with Lane's assistance lifts Floyd off the ground.\nThe pair walk Floyd across the street to a waiting squad car, where Floyd falls to the ground, the video shows. What happens next is unclear, as the officer in the park police vehicle makes a U-turn, blocking the camera's view.\n\"Mr. Floyd stiffened up, fell to the ground and told the officers he was claustrophobic,\" according to the probable cause statement.\nVideo 2: A struggle\nThe second video is short, about 20 seconds long, and comes from a Cup Foods security camera. Judging from the times provided in the probable cause statement and the timecode on the video, it appears to begin about five minutes after the other video ends.\nIn it, Kueng has his foot pressed against the curb while most of his body is obscured by the back door and the dark tint of the windows.

The light should have went (sic) off to do that, but we're not going to pass judgment,\" Kroll said. \"The justice system is going to prevail.\"\nBlasting city leadership\nIn attempting to defend Minneapolis police officers from what they view as unfair criticism, union officials took aim at the city's mayor and members of the city council who have recently called for the restructuring of the police department.\nUnion representatives also criticized Minneapolis police department leadership over their decision to allow rioters to set fire to the city's 3rd police precinct building without a show of force by officers to protect the building.\nSgt. Anna Hedberg, a director at the union, said there were officers scrambling to get their belongings out of the 3rd precinct before it fell. \"That's just ... that was one of the hardest things to ever watch in my career,\" Hedberg said.\n\"To watch 54 cops that shouldn't have been there get chased down the street because the failed politicians allowed them to be there, knowing full well that they weren't going to send the resources,\" she said.\nWhile police union leaders had no shortage of complaints against politicians who have been vocal in calling for policing reforms in the wake of Floyd's death, union leaders were unwilling to outline any specific proposals they would currently be willing to support.\nCorrections officers say they were barred from Derek Chauvin's floor because of their skin color\nAfter the killing of Floyd, the Minnesota governor called a special session of the state's legislature in hopes of pressing forward on a package of possible reforms, including reducing police violence, and efforts geared towards ensuring greater police accountability and transparency. Those efforts appeared to stall as the special session came to a close late last week with numerous reform bills still pending.\nAsked repeatedly by CNN what pieces of legislation they would support, Minneapolis police union officials said they had not yet had time to read the multiple bills put before the state's legislative bodies, and warned that hastily rushing through policing reform measures could have unintended consequences.\n\"We need time,\" said Kroll, adding, \"everybody's got to take a breath.\"\nA controversial president\nEven before the police encounter that resulted in the death of George Floyd, union president Bob Kroll found himself in the national spotlight for both controversial public statements and for actively engaging in partisan campaigning for President Donald Trump.\nPresident Donald Trump shakes hands with Minneapolis Police Union head Bob Kroll on stage during a campaign rally at the Target Center on October 10, 2019 in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\nIn 2016, Kroll referred to Black Lives Matter -- the diffuse group now responsible for organizing many of the primarily peaceful protests against police violence across the country -- as a \"terrorist organization,\" and said he did not see BLM as \"a voice for the black community in Minneapolis.\"\nAsked by CNN whether he stood by those comments, Kroll doubled down, saying he equates parts of the Black Lives Matter movement with domestic terrorism.\nKroll also defended his attendance on stage at a 2019 Trump campaign rally in Minnesota, saying he and his colleagues were unhappy with a statement at the time by the city's mayor indicating Trump was not welcome in the city.\n\"The Obama administration and the handcuffing and oppression of police was despicable,\" Kroll said as he stood next to the President wearing a 'Cops for Trump' shirt. \"The first thing President Trump did when he took office was turn that around,\" he added.\nIn 2007, Kroll was named in a racial discrimination lawsuit from five Minneapolis African American officers, in which they allege Kroll referred to then-US Rep. Keith Ellison as a \"terrorist.\" Ellison, who is now Minnesota's attorney general, is a Black Muslim -- and has promised to \"hold everyone accountable\" in the Floyd case.\nThe same lawsuit also accused Kroll of wearing a motorcycle jacket with \"white power\" written on it. Kroll denied the allegations and the lawsuit was settled for $740,000.\nIn 2004, Kroll was named in another lawsuit for excessive use of force against a man who allegedly brushed against his car. Kroll and another officer, who were both off-duty, allegedly shoved and kicked the man to the ground. Kroll denied any wrongdoing.\nA 2015 review of Kroll's 26 years on the force by the Minneapolis Star Tribune found 20 internal affairs complaints against him, all but three closed without any disciplinary action having been taken.\nMultiple investigations\nWhile union officials continue to defend their department's credibility following Floyd's death and the criminal charging of four of the city's police officers, scrutiny of the embattled department is likely to continue on multiple fronts.\nIn addition to the state's criminal investigation of Floyd's death, the FBI is actively pursuing a concurrent civil rights investigation of the incident. Furthermore, the Minnesota department of human rights continues to investigate whether there is a pattern of police officers in Minneapolis unfairly discriminating against people of color.\nStill, union officials say none of the recent events, nor the litany of investigations of the department should result in broad-brushing the city's police officers.\n\"We need people to quit categorizing police and the police profession as these violent racists and quit demonizing police for what they do,\" said Sherral Schmidt, union vice-president, to who again put the onus on politicians, adding the city's elected officials should \"spend more time looking at ways to get the community and the police engaged together so that we can move forward to developing safer communities for the people of Minneapolis.\""}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/01/us/derek-chauvin-what-we-know-trnd/index.html", "headline": "Derek Chauvin: What we know about the former officer charged in George Floyd's death", "published_date": "2020-06-01", "text": "(CNN)Derek Chauvin worked for the Minneapolis Police Department for more than 18 years.\nThen, within one week, he was filmed kneeling on George Floyd's neck for eight minutes before he died; fired from the police department; and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.\nThroughout it all, protesters in Minneapolis and across the country demanded justice for Floyd and accountability for Chauvin.\nChauvin is due to appear in court later this month.

Still, three other officers on scene -- Thomas Lane, J.A. Kueng and Tou Thao -- have not been charged, despite the family's and protesters' wishes. All four were fired by Chief Medaria Arradondo last week after video of the incident sparked outrage.\n\"If that community wants to see the protests stop, this district attorney must step up and do their job,\" NAACP President Derrick Johnson told CNN on Sunday. \"It's unfortunate it took so long to indict one person, but all three should be brought to justice.\"\nThree videos piece together the final moments of George Floyd's life\nThe decision is now in the hands of Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, who was appointed Sunday by Gov. Tim Walz to take the lead in the case. Floyd's family and the Minneapolis City Council had requested Ellison take over the case from Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman, CNN affiliate WCCO reported.\nEllison, a former Demoratic congressman, previously said that he had \"every expectation\" that charges will be filed against the officers and that he hoped they'd come soon.\nBut on Monday, after taking over the case, he cautioned against a rush to judgement and said prosecutors will be careful and methodical in bringing charges.\n\"We are moving as expeditiously, quickly and effectively as we can,\" he said. \"But I need to protect this prosecution. I am not going to create a situation where somebody can say this was a rush to judgement.\"\nPolice chief says officers were 'complicit'\nGeorge Floyd died while in the custody of four Minneapolis Police officers.\nEllison has said that any case against a police officer needs to be airtight given the difficulty of such prosecutions.\nPolice officers are rarely charged with crimes for violence against black men, and even in those rare cases, juries have repeatedly shown an unwillingness to convict. The list of such failed cases is long.\nThe officers in Rodney King's beating were not convicted at their 1992 state trial. In 2014, a grand jury declined to indict the New York Police officer accused of using a chokehold on Eric Garner. The state murder trial of Michael Slager, the officer charged with shooting Walter Scott, ended in 2016 with a hung jury and mistrial. In 2016, none of the six officers charged in Freddie Gray's death were convicted of wrongdoing. The Minnesota police officer who shot Philando Castile was found not guilty on all counts in 2017.\nThe few successful prosecutions of officers, including the murder convictions of former Minneapolis Police officer Mohamed Noor and former Dallas Police officer Amber Guyger, had different gender and racial dynamics as well.\nPolice Chief Arradondo told CNN's Sara Sidner on Sunday that the silence of the four officers involved in Floyd's death and their inaction made them \"complicit.\"\n\"Being silent or not intervening, to me, you're complicit. So I don't see a level of distinction any different,\" he said.\n\"Silence and inaction, you're complicit. You're complicit,\" he added. \"If there were one solitary voice that would have intervened and acted, that's what I would have hoped for.\"\nMinneapolis police chief says all four officers involved in George Floyd's death bear responsibility\nEllison said Monday he could not comment on the investigation, but he praised Arradondo's commentary on their inaction.\n\"I absolutely credit the observations of the chief,\" Ellison told CNN. \"He has the experience, the know-how, and the integrity to make that comment.\"\nEllison's role is to decide whether that complicity rises to criminality.\nElie Honig, a CNN legal analyst and former federal prosecutor, said the charge against Chauvin was clear just from the cell phone video. However, the criminal case against the other officers will require a more thorough examination of their actions -- or lack thereof.\n\"The key questions are what did each officer see and hear, and what did each officer physically do and say,\" he said. \"You have to be able to recreate that moment by moment in order to determine whether they're criminally liable.\"\nPossible aiding and abetting charge\nIf the three officers are charged, it would likely be on charges of aiding and abetting, Honig said. The basic idea is that if you help assist, counsel, or facilitate somebody else in committing crime, then you are liable for that crime as well, he explained.\nDon Lewis, the special prosecutor in Castile's case, similarly said aiding and abetting charges are \"very likely.\" He said he hoped that any such charges are brought within 30 days.\n\"I do believe you've gotta make sure you have the evidence that supports the charges. I do also agree that you have to act urgently,\" he said.\nStill, he acknowledged that the case against them was not foolproof.\n8 notable details in the criminal complaint against ex-Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin\n\"There is some strong evidence, but there are also some weak points that the defense can take advantage of,\" he said.\nThe statement of probable cause in Chauvin's criminal complaint provides some hints. The complaint repeatedly notes that the officers did not move from their positions as Chauvin placed his knee on Floyd's head and neck and as Floyd pleaded that he could not breathe.\nOne officer, identified as Lane, spoke up several times, the complaint states. While holding Floyd's legs, he said \"should we roll him on his side?\" and Chauvin said \"No, staying put where we got him,\" according to the complaint. Lane then said, \"I am worried about excited delirium or whatever,\" and Chauvin said \"that's why we have him on his stomach,\" the complaint states.\nA short time later, after video shows Floyd ceasing to breathe or speak, Lane allegedly said, \"want to roll him on his side,\" according to the complaint. Kueng checked Floyd's wrist for a pulse and said he found none, the complaint states. Again, none of the officers moved from their positions.\nChauvin's knee remained on Floyd's neck for almost 3 minutes after he became non-responsive, the complaint states. He left the scene in an ambulance and was pronounced dead at Hennepin County Medical Center, the document says.\nAn independent autopsy found that Floyd died of \"asphyxiation from sustained pressure.\" The autopsy says compression to Floyd's neck and back led to a lack of blood flow to his brain.\nBen Crump, the family's attorney, said the autopsy showed that each of the officers should be arrested.\n\"Mr. Floyd's death was a homicide by officers who taunted him while holding him down for more than eight minutes,\" he said in a statement. \"And the officer who stood by doing nothing was a physical blue shield -- a living symbol of the code of silence.\"\nCorrection: This story has been updated with the correct spelling of Tou Thao's name.\nCNN's Amir Vera contributed to this report"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/23/us/black-lives-matter-protests-continue/index.html", "headline": "Black Lives Matter protests across America continue nearly 2 months after George Floyd's death", "published_date": "2020-07-23", "text": "(CNN)The national Black Lives Matter protest movement, rekindled in the days after an unarmed George Floyd was killed by police in Minneapolis last May, continues to shine a light on what it calls systemic racism and police brutality from America's small towns to its urban centers.\nPortland, Oregon, has remained a flashpoint of national and global demonstrations that erupted after video emerged of Floyd pleading that he couldn't breathe as a police officer pinned him to the ground with a knee to the back of his neck for nearly nine minutes.\nAs in other parts of the country, the protests in Portland were mostly peaceful, though they have at times devolved into violence, vandalism and arson.\nVideo shows Portland mayor tear gassed with protesters 02:00\nProtesters last weekend pulled down barricades, moved them into streets and attempted to set a building on fire.

At 8:08 p.m., Minneapolis Police Department (MPD) Officers Thomas Lane and J.A. Kueng arrived with their body worn cameras (BWCs) activated and running. The officers learned from store personnel that the man who passed the counterfeit $20 was parked in a car around the corner from the store on 38th Street.\nBWC video obtained by the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension shows that the officers approached the car, Lane on the driver's side and Kueng on the passenger side. Three people were in the car; George Floyd was in the driver's seat, a known adult male was in the passenger seat and a known adult female was sitting in the backseat. As Officer Lane began speaking with Mr. Floyd, he pulled his gun out and pointed it at Mr. Floyd's open window and directed Mr. Floyd to show his hands. When Mr. Floyd put his hands in the steering wheel, Lane put his gun back in its holster.\nWhile Officer Kueng was speaking with the front seat passenger, Officer Lane ordered Mr. Floyd out of the car, put his hands on Mr. Floyd, and pulled him out of the car. Officer Lane handcuffed Mr. Floyd. Mr. Floyd actively resisted being handcuffed.\nOnce handcuffed, Mr. Floyd became compliant and walked with Officer Lane to the sidewalk and sat on the ground at Officer Lane's direction. In a conversation that lasted just under two minutes, Officer Lang asked Mr. Floyd for his name and identification. Officer Lane asked Mr. Lloyd if he was \"on anything\" and explained that he was arresting Mr. Lloyd for passing counterfeit currency.\nOfficers Kueng and Lane stood Mr. Floyd up and attempted to walk Mr. Floyd to their squad car (MPD 320) at 8:14 p.m. Mr. Floyd stiffened up, fell to the ground, and told the officers he was claustrophobic.\nMPD Officers Derek Chauvin (the defendant) and Tou Thao then arrived in a separate squad car.\nThe officers made several attempts to get Mr. Floyd in the backseat of squad 320 from the driver's side. Mr. Floyd did not voluntarily get in the car and struggled with the officers by intentionally falling down, saying he was not going in the car, and refusing to stand still. Mr. Floyd is over six feet tall and weighs more than 200 pounds.\nWhile standing outside the car, Mr. Floyd began saying and repeating that he could not breathe. The defendant went to the passenger side and tried to get Mr. Floyd into the car from that side and Lane and Kueng assisted.\nThe defendant pulled Mr. Floyd out of the passenger side of the squad car at 8:19:38 p.m. and Mr. Floyd went to the ground face down and still handcuffed. Kueng held Mr. Floyd's back and Lane held his legs. The defendant placed his left knee in the area of Mr. Floyd's head and neck. Mr. Floyd said, \"I can't breathe\" multiple times and repeatedly said, \"Mama\" and \"please,\" as well. The defendant and the other two officers stayed in their positions.\nThe officers said, \"You are talking fine\" to Mr. Floyd as he continued to move back and forth. Lane asked, \"should we roll him on his side?\" and the defendant said, \"No, staying put where we got him.\" Officer Lane said, \"I am worried about excited delirium or whatever.\" The defendant said, \"That's why we have him on his stomach.\" None of the three officers moved from their positions.\nBWC video shows Mr. Floyd continue to move and breathe. At 8:24:24, Mr. Floyd stopped moving. At 8:25:31 the video appears to show Mr. Floyd ceasing to breathe or speak. Lane said, \"want to roll him on his side.\" Kueng checked Mr. Floyd's right wrist for a pulse and said, \"I couldn't find one.\" None of the officers moved from their positions.\nAt 8:27:24, the defendant removed his knee from Mr. Floyd's neck. An ambulance and emergency medical personnel arrived, the officers placed Mr. Floyd on a gurney, and the ambulance left the scene. Mr. Floyd was pronounced dead at Hennepin County Medical Center.\nThe Hennepin County Medical Examiner (ME) conducted Mr. Floyd's autopsy on May 26, 2020. The full report of the ME is pending but the ME has made the following preliminary findings. The autopsy revealed no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation. Mr. Floyd had underlying health conditions including coronary artery disease and hypertensive heart disease. The combined effects of Mr. Floyd being restrained by the police, his underlying health conditions and any potential intoxicants in his system likely contributed to his death.\nThe defendant had his knee on Mr. Floyd's neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds in total. Two minutes and 53 seconds of this was after Mr. Floyd was non-responsive. Police are trained that this type of restraint with a subject in a prone position is inherently dangerous.\nDefendant is in custody.\"\nCorrection: This story has been updated with the correct spelling of Tou Thao's name.\nCNN's Kara Devlin as a contributor on this story."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/04/us/ferguson-first-black-mayor-police-protest/index.html", "headline": "Ferguson's first black elected mayor says videos of police abuse help to get rid of bad officers", "published_date": "2020-06-04", "text": "(CNN)Ella Jones -- who was elected as the first black and first female mayor of Ferguson, Missouri, on Tuesday -- shared what her election symbolizes and where the nation should go next after George Floyd's death.\nIt is crucial that police officers work with communities to make people \"feel that they are being served, instead of being hunted,\" she told CNN's Chris Cuomo Wednesday night.\n\"The only way to do that is to have courageous conversations,\" she said, and to have \"the police officers at the table with us.\"\nJones' historic win comes as protests over the killing of George Floyd while in police custody grip the nation.

Floyd had been unresponsive for two minutes, 53 seconds before Chauvin moved, according to the criminal complaint.\nFor the manslaughter charge, Jackson says, authorities would just have to demonstrate that the officer was careless or reckless that he \"disregarded the risk.\"\nUnder Minnesota law, second-degree manslaughter is described as when a person \"an unreasonable risk, and consciously takes chances of causing death or great bodily harm to another.\"\nCNN's Kara Devlin contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/24/us/redskins-george-preston-marshall-spt-trnd/index.html", "headline": "Redskins to remove their founder's name from the team's Ring of Fame.

I'm the deputy majority leader and highest-ranking senator from New York City, so I have a special obligation to take a stand, given what happened and what we continue to see on the streets every day.\"\nGianaris said even though the decision wasn't a reflection on police officers on the whole, he's received threats from police saying they will not respond to 911 calls if he should ever need to make one.\n\"It's outrageous to suggest someone's public safety should be put in danger,\" he said. \"We're not in a political alliance with law enforcement.

More than 70% of Americans see Floyd's death as part of a larger racial problem, according to an ABC News/Ipsos poll.\nI've never seen so many white people as angry about racism as its victims.\nThis was unthinkable during the King riots.\nMany of the people I talked to in South Central perceived that much of white America saw them as animals. They thought whites were titillated by tales of gang violence and tough LAPD cops. One of my friends called it \"gangster chic.\" But most whites didn't seem interested in learning about the type of racism that made some black people's lives so miserable.\nThey are now. When President George W. Bush releases a statement asking, \"How do we end systemic racism in our society?\" something has changed.\nMore white people are saying what Andy Stanley, a prominent white evangelical pastor, said during a recent sermon on the Floyd protests: It's no longer enough to be a non-racist; one must be an anti-racist.\nDemonstrators gather in St. Paul, Minnesota on June 5, 2020, to protest he death of George Floyd.\nThe Floyd video was an Emmett Till moment for white America, one professor told me.\n\"Perhaps the tipping point of violence against black citizens has finally broken though the apathy of the dominant majority, such as Emmett Till's open casket and the images of his brutalized face (that) finally snapped many Americans out of a delusional belief that America was great for all,\" says Susan Peppers-Bates, a philosophy professor and director of the Africana Studies minor at Stetson University in Florida.\nOne of my friends put it best when he called me one recent night after watching white demonstrators square off against police in riot gear. He declared:\n\"White people get it now.\"\nThe Floyd protesters have the perfect villain\nMy optimism is also based on another encounter with a young black man. This one took place five years ago in Baltimore.\nThe experience literally hit home for me.\nI'd been sent to the city to cover the unrest over Gray, a black man who died while in police custody. The epicenter of the riots was in the same neighborhood where I grew up. National Guardsmen with assault rifles patrolled outside the house where I played with friends.\nI spotted a teenager in braids leaning against a sign at a nearby bus stop. He scowled as I approached. Everyone seemed angry that day.\nPeople walk past burning cars near the intersection of Pennsylvania Avenue and North Avenue in Baltimore on April 27, 2015. Riots erupted in the city following the funeral service for Freddie Gray, who died while in Baltimore Police custody.\nHis name was Malik, and he told me he was angry at Baltimore's mayor for calling young protesters \"thugs.\" He didn't think any of the city's political or law enforcement leaders cared about young black men like himself.\n\"They talk about 'We the future,' but they killing us,\" Malik, then 15, told me.\nThis wasn't a South Central rerun. Malik was angry at black people, not white people. The city leaders he castigated were all black.\nEvery protest movement needs a focal point for its wrath. The civil rights movement had a racist antagonist, Alabama lawman \"Bull\" Connor. The #MeToo movement has movie mogul Harvey Weinstein. But the Freddie Gray protests didn't really have that, and I think it hurt them.\nI detected a palpable letdown in my old Baltimore neighborhood when people finally saw the pictures of the six police officers arrested in connection with Gray's death. Half of them were black. The city's police chief and mayor were black. How could protesters claim that Gray was a victim of racist cops and politicians when Baltimore was controlled by black leaders?\nPolice officers from previous protests faded from public view like phantoms. Many have forgotten their names.\nThe Floyd protesters, though, may have the perfect villain in President Trump.\nIntentionally or not, he has mobilized protesters.\nPresident Donald Trump walks past police in Lafayette Park after he visited St. John's Church across from the White House on Monday, June 1, 2020.\nMany were outraged by his tweet saying, \"when the looting starts, the shooting starts.\" The use of smoke canisters and pepper balls to remove protesters so Trump could hold up a Bible in front of a church backfired by turning out more protesters, Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said.\n\"You have a leader who is thoroughly incompetent and inept in this moment,\" Bryan Adamson, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio, told me. \"He has managed to fan the flames of racism.\"\nPolice culture won't be the same\nAnother memory from 1992 Los Angeles suggests to me that this time may be different.\nIt's when I met one of the most notorious police chiefs in America. His name was Daryl Gates, and he was chief of the Los Angeles Police Department during the Rodney King riots. A veteran of the US Navy, Gates helped spread the militarization of police departments around the nation.\nGates once told a US Senate committee that casual drug users \"ought to be taken out and shot.\" He said that more blacks died from police chokeholds because their arteries were not the same as \"normal people,\" a remark for which he later apologized. Under Gates' command, the LAPD used an armored personnel carrier to bash in suspected drug houses.\nDemonstrators protest outside Los Angeles Police Department Headquarters after the verdict in the Rodney King case.\nGates was forced to resign from the LAPD in 1992. But until now I have never seen so many police officers break publicly with the military culture that's embedded in so many departments.\nPolice officers have knelt with and marched with protesters. Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo asked his department to provide escort services for Floyd's body upon his return to the city for his burial.\nThe days of big-city police chiefs acting like Gen. George Patton may be over. The potential legal and political costs are too high.\nBesides, there's something about the Floyd video that hits at law enforcement in a way that other videos didn't, says Adamson, the Case Western professor.\n\"I think many officers, especially black and brown, had to be wrecked by what they saw,\" Adamson says.\nPolice officers kneel during a rally in Coral Gables, Florida, on May 30, 2020 in response to the death of George Floyd.\nThe Floyd video could lead to concrete changes in police culture. Already, all four Minneapolis officers who were filmed arresting Floyd have been arrested and charged in his death. Other police departments have also taken swift recent action against officers accused of misconduct.\nPoliticians are getting involved. The Minneapolis City Council has pledged to defund and dismantle the city's police department in the wake of Floyd's death. Such steps could include everything from dismantling the structure of the city's police force to dramatically reducing its budget.\nCongressional Democrats released a package of proposed police reforms, and some local governments are banning chokeholds. Republicans, and the White House, are discussing reforms as well.\nSimilar reforms have been tried before, including after the Rodney King, Ferguson and Freddie Gray protests. But the movement has more momentum now.\nAnd what if it's still not enough?\nIf protesters ultimately help make policy, and not just noise, my optimism may be validated.\nThe US Congressman and civil rights icon John Lewis recently said something that's crucial: \"The vote is the most powerful nonviolent tool we have in a democratic society.\"\nA Trump victory in November, though, could derail any momentum generated by the protests, says Christopher Huff, a history professor at Beacon College in Florida who studies protest movements.\n\"It would be devastating,\" Huff says. \"If what's happening now translates into an electoral defeat in November, that would be an indicator that what's been going on may have lacked a grounding to effect long-term change.\"\nDemonstrators denouncing systemic racism and the police killings of black Americans rally in Washington Square Park on June 6, 2020, in New York City.\nI'm familiar with this kind of disappointment. I've seen the hope for police reform rise and fall. I try not to return to the level of pessimism that I once felt while listening to the young man who only wanted to make a baby before he was murdered.\nBut now I have a new fear. What if this time really is different, but that's still not enough to affect meaningful change?\nWhat if I keep seeing a succession of unarmed black and brown people struck down on videos? What if one day it's someone I know -- or me?\nAnd yet in other moments, I also believe that true change is possible. The price of police brutality is becoming too high to pay. There is a new generation of black, brown and white anti-racists who will change America.\nIn truth, I bounce between hope and skepticism: This time won't be different. This time will be different.\nIt may not make sense to believe both. But it's better than what I once felt: no hope at all."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/12/us/denver-school-board-cuts-ties-to-police-trnd/index.html", "headline": "Denver's school board votes to end its relationship with the city's police department", "published_date": "2020-06-12", "text": "(CNN)Police officers will soon no longer work in Denver's public schools.\nThe Denver school board voted unanimously on Thursday to end its contract with the city's police department, which provided school resource officers to work in the district's schools.\nFour police officers will be phased out by the end of the year, while the remaining 13 officers will be phased out by mid-2021, board member Tay Anderson told CNN.\nThe vote comes amid weeks of demonstrations across the country following the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis and calls to defund or abolish police departments.\nMinneapolis schools and parks cut ties with police over George Floyd's death\nAnderson, who also serves as the board's at-large director, wrote in a Facebook post on Friday that the decision was prompted by the higher rate at which nonwhite students were referred to law enforcement.\n\"Last night we voted to end the contract with Denver Police, but this was never about an individual officer,\" Anderson wrote.\n\"It was about dismantling a system that has held children of color down for far too long.

That means the procedure, which is restricted or banned in many large police departments around the country, was used an average of about once a week in the city over that time period.\nWe offer several ways to reach our journalists securely.\nAbout two-thirds of the people placed in neck restraints by Minneapolis officers were black -- in a city where black residents make up 19% of the population, according to Census data.\nUse of force experts told CNN that the procedure that officer Derek Chauvin used -- pressing his knee into the back of Floyd's neck for several minutes, as Floyd groaned that he couldn't breathe -- wouldn't qualify as a proper neck restraint under the city's policy and procedure manual.\nAs America sees another night of protests and curfews, families of those killed plea for no more violence\nBut the Minneapolis department does allow officers to compress \"one or both sides of a person's neck with an arm or leg, without applying direct pressure to the trachea or airway,\" according to a section of the manual that is marked as last being updated in 2012.

His attorney has not responded to CNN's requests for comment.\nWhat happened to George Floyd was 'crazy inappropriate,' expert says\nSeth Stoughton, an associate professor of law at the University of South Carolina who's written a book about police use of force, said many large police departments banned neck restraints after protests in the 1960s, following criticism that similar chokeholds resulted in fatalities.

The data is updated daily.\nNBC News first reported on the Minneapolis department's neck restraint data.\nVideos of NYPD conduct during George Floyd protests under investigation, mayor says\nThe city's police manual lays out two types of neck restraint procedures: Conscious neck restraints, which use lighter pressure, and unconscious neck restraints, which are designed to make the person being held lose consciousness but not to kill them. Unconscious neck restraints are only allowed to be used on people who are \"exhibiting active aggression\" or cannot be subdued by other methods, or \"for life saving purposes.\"\n\"Neck restraints shall not be used against subjects who are passively resisting,\" the manual states. It defines passive resistance as someone who is not attempting \"to defeat an officer's control efforts.\"\nThey 'tensed' and police put them in neck restraints\nStill, the department's data shows that many encounters resulting in neck restraints began with seemingly minor provocations. The most common incident that preceded someone being placed in a neck restraint was a report of a \"suspicious person,\" which accounted for 83 of the 428 cases.\nAnd the most common type of \"resistance\" by a subject that led to officers placing them in a neck restraint was that they \"tensed\" -- the description used for 162 of the cases. Those explanations come from officers' own reports about the incidents.\nObama condemns violence and calls for change in wake of George Floyd protests\nNearly half of people who lost consciousness in neck restraints were injured, according to the data. The reports don't specify how serious those injuries are.\nOverall, the city has seen an overall decline in use of the procedure in recent years. While 71 people were subject to neck restraints in 2012, the first year for which data is available, 49 experienced it in 2019.

Stores were also looted.\nElsewhere in LA, rubber bullets were also used, some demonstrators said. \"Insecure\" actor Kendrick Sampson took to social media to share that he was shot seven times with rubber bullets by police during a protest May 30.\n\"He pointed the gun DIRECTLY AT ME,\" Sampson wrote on Twitter, linking to a news report about his experience. \"I actually got hit 7 times with rubber bullets and many with batons.

But he was not the only disabled person in a wheelchair to be struck in the face by a rubber bullet as the LAPD enforced curfew laws and other misdemeanors in the last week.\"\nIn the lawsuit filed Friday, one demonstrator alleged that he was detained and handcuffed tightly behind his back for about four hours, experiencing numbness, bruising and soreness.\nThe lawsuit also alleges that some unhoused people \"had no place they could go to avoid violating the curfew,\" yet they were \"subjected to excessive force,\" arrested, \"tightly handcuffed\" and taken on buses to Jackie Robinson Stadium on the Veterans Affairs property in West Los Angeles.\nWhen asked about the photo of the man in the wheelchair and allegations of excessive force for those detained, a spokesperson for the LAPD told CNN over the phone: \"We're not making statements on any of those to the fact that they're investigations now and we cannot comment on them.\"\n'We want peace'\nDuring a news conference last Monday, Moore said those protesting by committing criminal acts were not mourning Floyd.\n\"We didn't have people mourning the death of this man, George Floyd -- we had people capitalizing,\" the police chief said June 1. \"His death is on their hands as much as it is those officers.\"\nMoore apologized on Twitter, but many had already expressed their outrage over his comments in replies to the video which was posted on Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti's Twitter page.\n\"I misspoke when making a statement about those engaging in violent acts following the murder of George Floyd,\" he wrote.\nSome demonstrators last week said they wanted \"peace\" with police.\n\"We want peace,\" Joseph Haynes told CNN on June 2. \"We're trying to tell the police, all over the country, if you just march with us you're showing that you're not standing in solidarity for a system that has oppressed people for hundreds of years.\"\nAn LAPD officer chases a suspected looter in an alley behind Hollywood Boulevard on June 1.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) branch in Southern California filed a lawsuit last week on behalf of the Black Lives Matter organization over the curfews in Los Angeles city and county, as well as San Bernardino.\n\"The curfews' extraordinary suppression of all political protest in the evening hours plainly violates the First Amendment to the US Constitution, and their blanket restrictions on movement outside working hours violate the Constitution's protection of freedom of movement,\" the ACLU said in a news release issued June 3.\nGarcetti, Moore and Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva are among the defendants listed in that suit.\nLA County and the city of LA had separate curfews. Both LA County and the Los Angeles mayor lifted the curfew last Thursday. A sheriff's spokesperson told CNN affiliate CBSLA that the decision to lift curfew was not linked to the ACLU lawsuit.\nMayor and police chief garner backlash\nLos Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti has agreed to slash between $100 million and $150 million from the proposed funding for the LAPD.\nAs people continue to voice their concerns over the police department's treatment of protesters, Garcetti has also become the center of backlash.\nGarcetti is the son of former Los Angeles District Attorney Gil Garcetti, who was elected in the aftermath of riots sparked by the 1992 acquittal of four officers charged in the 1991 Rodney King beating. The Rev. Al Sharpton said in 2012 that King's beating \"made America focus on the presence of profiling and police misconduct.\"\nNow the younger Garcetti is a leader amid a similarly tense time for the city.\nIn an interview with CNN's Ana Cabrera on May 30, Garcetti said there are \"absolutely\" lessons to be learned from his father's experiences during that time.\n\"What we learned from that is that we have to actually start to listen to each other,\" he said. \"Law enforcement has to hear the pain of African American men and communities of color ... but secondly, we have to humanize who those people behind the badge are, too.\"\nLast Tuesday, on June 2, protesters gathered outside Garcetti's home.\nAbout an hour after #LosAngeles curfew, a group of protesters remains outside Mayor @ericgarcetti home.

His image is on shirts, almost always depicted kneeling.\nColin Kaepernick #7 and Eric Reid #35 of the San Francisco 49ers kneel in protest during the national anthem prior to playing the Los Angeles Rams in their NFL game at Levi's Stadium on September 12, 2016.\nJust this week, as thousands of protesters across the US and the world protested police brutality after the death of George Floyd, many took a knee -- just as Kaepernick did.\nFriday evening, Rapper and actor Ice Cube took to Twitter, calling the NFL out specifically.\n\"NFL: Do The Right Thing by this man,\" he wrote, attaching a photo of Kaepernick.\nKaepernick has been vocal about his desire to continue playing, even reaching a settlement in 2019 for his collusion grievance against the NFL, alleging that teams had kept him and fellow activist Eric Reid from playing.\nEven before Goodell's admission that the NFL made a mistake, there were calls to rehire Kaepernick.\nJoe Lockhart, a CNN political analyst and former NFL executive, wrote an op-ed urging the owners of the Minnesota Vikings specifically to sign Kaepernick.\n\"It will not solve the problem of blacks and police violence,\" he wrote. \"But it will recognize the problem that Kaepernick powerfully raised, and perhaps show that, with courage, real progress can be made.\"\nOn Friday, though, those calls grew even louder.\nClint Smith, author and social commentator, was blunt: \"The NFL should formally apologize to Colin Kaepernick.\" That post already has more than 25,000 retweets, and counting.\nGoodell's statement, though stronger, doesn't cut it anymore, the sentiments online went.\nThe people, at least on social media, want action. They want, frankly, Kaepernick.\n\nCORRECTION: This piece has been updated to say Mike Freeman is a former NFL columnist for Bleacher Report."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/03/us/atlanta-college-students-officers-charged-trnd/index.html", "headline": "'I thought I might be killed' -- college student recalls traumatic encounter with Atlanta police", "published_date": "2020-06-03", "text": "(CNN)Taniyah Pilgrim says she feared she might not survive when police used a Taser on her friend Messiah Young and pulled Pilgrim from a vehicle the pair were riding in during street protests in Atlanta on Saturday.\n\"I thought I might be killed,\" she told Alisyn Camerota on CNN's \"New Day\" on Wednesday.\n\"Nothing really warranted it ...

It was an alert from the heart of the raging protests in Minneapolis, posted on an online forum by a fellow member of the Boogaloo movement, a loosely knit group of heavily armed, anti-government extremists.\nThe \"alert\" was from a man who had a run-in with the Minneapolis police while on the frontline of the police-brutality protests set off by the death of George Floyd.\n\"He caught mace to the face,\" said Teeter, and \"put out a national notice to our network.\"\nBenjamin Ryan Teeter, front, during a stay-at-home order protest in Raleigh N.C. last month.\nAfter Teeter -- who goes by Ryan -- said he saw the online posting, he and a handful of other Boogaloo friends in the area mobilized.\nThey grabbed their guns -- mostly assault rifles -- hopped into their vehicles, and made the 18-hour trek to Minneapolis.\nThe Boogaloos are an emerging incarnation of extremism that seems to defy easy categorization. They are yet another confounding factor in the ongoing effort among local, state and federal officials to puzzle out the political sympathies of the agitators showing up to the mostly peaceful George Floyd rallies who have destroyed property, looted businesses, or -- in the case of the Boogaloos who descended on Minneapolis -- walked around the streets with assault rifles.\nBoogaloo members appear to hold conflicting ideological views with some identifying as anarchists and others rejecting formal titles. Some pockets of the group have espoused white supremacy while others reject it. But they have at least two things in common: an affinity for toting around guns in public and a \"boogaloo\" rallying cry, which is commonly viewed as code for another US civil war.\nMegan Squire, a computer science professor at Elon University in North Carolina who monitors online extremism, said the movement started in obscure online platforms.\nIt \"is now growing on mainstream platforms, and in this moment of protest it is starting to move offline,\" she said. \"It resembles the militia movement that came before it, which has been well documented as a force for promoting violence.\"\nTeeter, in an interview with CNN, said he identifies as an anarchist. His mission in Minneapolis, he said, was to protect protesters from police abuse and white supremacists, whom he deplores.\nWe offer several ways to reach our journalists securely.\n\"If people are going to initiate deadly force against us, we need to be willing and able to initiate deadly force in return,\" Teeter, 22, said.\nDespite the presence of Teeter, and he said a dozen or so of his compatriots, federal, state and local officials have put forth little evidence so far to suggest widespread organization and mobilization by any one ideological group. A CNN review of the backgrounds of those arrested during the first three days of protests in Minneapolis did not surface any obvious links to known organizations.\nSome police said they suspect that much of the rioting and looting was perpetrated not by ideological extremists, but smaller groups of criminal opportunists seeking to profit by stealing merchandise.\n\"These are straight up criminals. These are not protestors,\" said one high-ranking LAPD official. In Los Angeles, he said, roving bands of thieves drove around in cars and communicated by cellphone, identifying businesses to loot.\nStill, there are some documented reports of group-affiliated individuals from the left and right of the extremist spectrum mingling amid the less organized.\nIn Nevada, federal prosecutors this week charged three men who allegedly identify with the Boogaloo movement with possessing a \"Molotov cocktail\" explosive and conspiring to \"cause destruction during protests in Las Vegas,\" according to a press release from the US Attorney's Office.\nA member of the Boogaloo Bois walks next to protesters demonstrating outside Charlotte Mecklenburg Police Department Metro Division 2 just outside of downtown Charlotte, North Carolina, on May 29, 2020.\nStephen T. \"Kiwi\" Parshall, Andrew Lynam, and William L. Loomis, all of whom have military experience, had attended a protest on May 29 honoring George Floyd in Las Vegas, according to the criminal complaint. Parshall allegedly tried to encourage violence by \"telling protesters that peaceful protests don't accomplish anything,\" the complaint states. The three men were arrested on their way to a second Floyd-related demonstration the following day, allegedly armed with a Molotov cocktail, according to the records.\nGun-toting Boogaloo members also have appeared at George Floyd protests in Minneapolis, Salt Lake City, Dallas, Atlanta and elsewhere, according to The Washington Post.\nKnown for sporting Hawaiian shirts and arriving to public protests heavily armed, the decentralized Boogaloo movement -- sometimes referred to as the \"Boogaloo Bois\" -- is often associated with the far-right.\nWhat we do and don't know about the extremists taking part in riots across the US\nBut it is far from a cohesive group, said J.J. MacNab, a fellow at George Washington University who studies anti-government extremism.\n\"While there are pockets of white supremacist Boogaloos, the younger and bigger groups are generally not,\" she said in a recent Twitter thread. \"While there are Boogaloos that support police, the younger and bigger groups detest them. While there are Boogaloos that want to discredit protests angry at the murder of a black man, there are younger Boogaloos that are incensed by the murder and want to join the protests.\"\nMacNab added that such internal divisions don't always play out according to age.\n\"They share jargon, outfits, a love of firearms, and a desire to use violence to gain power, but they don't actually share a common goal once power is achieved,\" she said.\nThe origin of the name is thought to trace back to a 1980s movie sequel about breakdancing called \"Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo.\" The term \"boogaloo\" in recent years has caught on as a sly online reference to social unrest and a desired second civil war.\n\"The boogaloo meme\" is a \"joke for some,\" but \"acts as a violent meme that circulates instructions for a violent, viral insurgency for others,\" says a white paper released in February by the Network Contagion Research Institute, a group of independent researchers who monitor misinformation and hate speech, in association with Rutgers University.\n\"Termed the 'boogaloo,' this ideology self-organizes across social media communities, boasts tens of thousands of users, exhibits a complex division of labor,\" says the report, and \"evolves well-developed channels to innovate and distribute violent propaganda.\"\nThere are signs that adherents have been venturing out of the chat rooms and into the real world, most notably at various reopen demonstrations during the Covid-19 lockdowns. In April, a Boogaloo devotee was arrested in Texas for allegedly attempting to find and kill police officers while filming on Facebook Live, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.\nThe movement seems to have gained considerable traction in recent months.\nThe Tech Transparency Project of a non-profit watchdog group called Campaign for Accountability released a report this spring concluding that more than 60% of the 125 identifiable Boogaloo groups on Facebook have sprung up since January, and picked up steam after the onset of the Covid-19 lockdowns.\nTo talk to Teeter -- who also recently attended protests decrying the Covid-19 lockdown -- is to get a sense of just how profoundly scrambled the Boogaloo ideology can be.\n\"I'm a member of the LGBT community,\" said Teeter, who describes himself as a non-voting \"left anarchist...People think I'm part of a Nazi group; I'm not.\"\nBut, he added, \"I don't think people should be forced to bake the cake,\" referring to a US Supreme Court case that stemmed from the refusal of a Christian owner of a bakery in Colorado to provide a wedding cake for a gay couple.\nIn Minneapolis, Teeter said, he and others in his group stood sentry with firearms outside of mom-and-pop shops, but in solidarity with the black community in opposition to police brutality.\n\"We are very careful to make sure that people realize that we are on their side. We are here to defend them ... Once people realize that we are on their side and we are here to protect them, everybody has been -- almost everybody -- has been very happy to have us here.\"\nTeeter said he was home schooled, but did not complete college despite being offered scholarships.\n\"I've always been able to self-educate,\" he said. \"We have the Internet. You can learn anything you want to learn for free.\"\nHe has had some brushes with the law. He said on a recent podcast that he's been to jail \"eight or nine\" times, though he suggested at least some of those incidents involved actions related to his activism.\nAn administrator for the New Hanover County criminal court in North Carolina told CNN that Teeter has a pending charge from January of 2019 for discharging a firearm in city limits. Teeter told CNN it was an accidental discharge that occurred while he was cleaning the weapon.\n'All the world is watching': After nationwide protests, 4 ex-officers face new charges in George Floyd's death\nHis social media posts appear consistent with his idiosyncratic political persuasions: photos of himself in a flak jacket or participating in the reopen protests, and memes lamenting police brutality, celebrating black men with guns, ridiculing both President Trump and Democratic Presidential candidate Joe Biden, and glorifying the Boogaloo movement and the notion of \"coming civil conflict.\"\nExtremism experts say other militias are starting to adopt the Boogaloo moniker.\nA report on the \"Militia-sphere\" released Tuesday by the Network Contagion Research Institute said militias such as Oath Keepers and Three Percenters \"now share the same boogaloo meme both in the virtual and real world.\"\nSquire said there appears to be a generational divide in the Boogaloo movement, with the younger subset having been steeped in meme culture online, and the older group looking for a rebrand.\n\"It's like an updated, younger take,\" she said. \"And so that's appealing to the guys who are in the actual meme-ing, very online age group, right. But it's also appealing to these older guys, who are kind of stale.\"\nSquire, who tracks the online chatter of groups such as Boogaloo, alerted CNN about Teeter's trip to Minneapolis. She said he is emblematic of the younger subset. But according to the social media data she monitors, Squire said Teeter stands out for having taken the initiative to drive all the way to Minneapolis.\n\"We've seen less of that -- driving across the country -- because the protests have erupted in more places,\" she said. \"And so these guys that were on the fence about whether or not to go, they can just stay where they are and just do the local protest.\"\nTeeter, by contrast, is proactive, Squire said.\n\"He's committed,\" she said. \"He's a vanguard.\"\nOn the streets of Minneapolis, Teeter said his group hasn't always been \"kitted out\" with guns drawn. During the day, when the protests have been more peaceful, Teeter said, he and his ilk have blended in with the crowds, chanting along.\nHe said they often bring out their weapons later in the day and into the evening, \"once things start to get dark.\"\nCNN's Scott Bronstein, Scott Glover and Collette Richards contributed to this report"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/16/us/lapd-protests-overtime/index.html", "headline": "Protests in Los Angeles cost LAPD $40 million in overtime expenses but officers won't be paid", "published_date": "2020-06-16", "text": "(CNN)Protests in Los Angeles, first over stay at home orders and then the death of George Floyd, have resulted in large amounts of overtime work for officers of the Los Angeles Police Department, but they will not be paid for the time, according to an internal memo.\nThe department will compensate the officers in time off instead, LAPD told CNN.\n\"During this extraordinary time, including the full mobilization of our sworn members, the Department has expended more than $40 million dollars in overtime expenses,\" the memo reads. \"This amount far exceeds any budgetary reserve to address unusual occurrences.\"\nThe overtime compensation policy applies to hours beginning June 7, 2020, according to the memo obtained by CNN.

Garner was videotaped being restrained by an NYPD officer while saying that he couldn't breathe.\nIn a press conference before the vote, City Council Speaker Corey Johnson apologized for the bills not having moved more quickly.\n\"I think the conversation around policing and re-envisioning what public safety looks like, that conversation should have started a long time ago,\" Johnson said at the press conference conducted via Zoom. \"It should have started after all of these deaths that we've seen and sadly it didn't.

I'm so glad I don't take no for an answer,\" Carr said. \"I'm glad that they saw fit to pass this. Just to have it passed and to have it on the books is a step in the right direction.

Some personally experienced the sting of police brutality. Some demand things need to change.\nFor their unique motivations, all of them agreed -- this work has become a vital part of who they are.\nHere are three reasons why they still march.\nTo maintain momentum\nTyrell Taylor, pictured center in the red hat, leads Black Lives Matter protests on bikes.\nBefore the pandemic, 22-year-old Tyrell Taylor and 12 of his friends used to get together and do anything they could to stay active. Those meetups came to a screeching halt once New York started shutting down in March.\nTo beat the boredom, they formed a group called MBR, or Mind, Body, Results, for organized bike rides.\nAfter the death of George Floyd, those leisurely rides became acts of protest.\nThe group meets every Friday at 6 p.m. with a few exceptions. They've occupied the Brooklyn Bridge, Washington Square Park and Times Square, among other iconic New York locales. At their largest protest, Taylor and his friends rode with 1,000 cyclists.\nClogging the streets with bikes is both disruptive and peaceful, Taylor, a graduate student at Medaille College, told CNN. Their bikes have become their platforms for anti-racism.\n\"Our main focus is to be a community, a family,\" Taylor said, \"Without that, we're just a bunch of strangers yelling 'Black Lives Matter' and that's not what we want to create, we want people to know and be familiar with what they're going into the protest to achieve.\"\nAt their largest protest, over 1,000 cyclists joined Taylor and his friends.\nThe group's founding members have all experienced dehumanizing encounters with police -- racial profiling, police brutality, stop-and-frisk. Like many Black Lives Matter protesters, they're calling to defund the city's police department. NYPD funding accounts for around 6% of the city's overall budget.\nTaylor has had to cancel protests at times, but the group would come back the following week stronger. Quitting would mean throwing away almost two months of progress, Taylor said\n\"I would say, even if you feel like it's getting repetitive, if you're getting tired of doing it, continue to do it, because they're waiting for you to stop,\" he said. \"And knowing that they're waiting for us to stop, makes us want to go twice as hard.\"\nTaylor said he thinks now the movement for Black lives is peaking.\n\"People are falling off, but it's our job to maintain this peak.\"\nTo be an ally\nWiliam Kilgore has attended protests weekly in St. Petersburg, Florida, since George Floyd's death.\nFlorida native William Kilgore has hardly gone a day without marching for Black lives since protests began in May. He's documented the demonstrations in St. Petersburg, a burgeoning city along the state's Gulf Coast, on Twitter since their inception, and he said he's seen them grow more unified, even if turnout is lower than it was initially.\n\"You have to understand that this is a marathon, not a sprint,\" he told CNN. \"I'd say the focus and organization is actually much stronger than it was on day one.\"\nBlack Lives Matter protests across America continue nearly 2 months after George Floyd's death\nKilgore, who is White, said his community appears to be progressive, but the Black Lives Matter movement has laid bare inequalities in education, income and opportunity within the city.\n\"Racism is still deeply ingrained in every institution of this city,\" he said.\nThe St. Petersburg Police Department showed it was receptive to change this month when it announced it will dispatch social workers to some non-violent calls instead of uniformed officers.\nIt's a start, said Kilgore, who support defunding the police department, but \"not enough to satiate people's thirst for true equality.\" The announcement came around the same time police began to fine protesters for blocking the street.\nFlorida has its hands full with the coronavirus pandemic with nearly 400,000 cases, and St. Petersburg is no exception with over 14,000 of those cases. But Kilgore said attention must continue to be paid to the movement for Black lives.\n\"I plan on staying the course as long as it takes to achieve radical change here in St. Pete,\" he said. \"I am in it for the long haul.\"\nTo disrupt the status quo\nFrederick Edwards Jr. (left) and Jamaal Abegaz march for Black lives in Fargo, North Dakota.\nFargo, North Dakota, didn't have a formal Black Lives Matter chapter until a few days after the death of George Floyd, when four residents coalesced to found the organization's Fargo-Moorhead branch.\nThey've had to become a family fast.\nBefore they joined the Black Lives Matter board, they advocated for Black lives in Fargo in different ways: Kiara Jackson is president of North Dakota State University's Black Student Association, where she met fellow board member and graduate student Frederick Edwards Jr. There's Faith Dixon, who runs a daycare and nonprofit in Fargo, and Jamaal Abegaz works with the local Democratic Socialists group.\nFor their differences in background and age, they're a formidable team. They've led several marches since May 30 in their predominantly White community and met with local officials to plead for change.\nTheir work energizes them. It's also made them targets, they told CNN.\nThey've been told their protests \"make the town look bad.\" Abegaz said he's received death threats.\n\"Just the simple act of saying that things need to change and that we're not going to go along with the status quo puts our lives in harm,\" Abegaz said.\nFaith Dixon (left), Edwards and Kiara Jackson pose at a Juneteenth march planned by Black Lives Matter of Fargo/Moorhead.\nThe violence of the first protest has affected subsequent turnout. The initial march after Floyd's death attracted over 3,000 participants. Now up to 300 people join them, the group told CNN.\nDixon said they've been painted as the enemy, which intimidates residents from joining them.\n\"We are citizens of this community which we love,\" Dixon said. \"I own a business here. Our families are here. Why would we want to see a city we care so much about be ruined ... We're four individuals that have a right to speak and have a right to protest, and why is it such a huge fight just to do that?\"\nAmong their demands are defunding the police, or reallocating some of the police department's budget to social services like education and public health. They want a police oversight board that doesn't include police, and they want new police recruits to complete a college-level course about the cultural diversity of the area. And they've asked police to immediately end their use of force, including the use of tear gas and rubber bullets at protests.\nThe demonstrators will hold as many more protests as it takes for those changes to come, Dixon said. Their work has become a part of who they are.\n\"We're organizing for our lives,\" Abegaz said. \"We have to live, so we're not going to live under somebody's boot.\""}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/22/us/cincinnati-reds-joey-votto-kneel-anthem-spt-trnd/index.html", "headline": "Cincinnati Reds players, including 6-time All-Star Joey Votto, kneel during National Anthem", "published_date": "2020-07-22", "text": "(CNN)Before they went on to beat the Detroit Tigers 9-7, the players of the Cincinnati Reds lined up along the first-base line for the National Anthem.

The most recent deaths include George Floyd in Minneapolis, Breonna Taylor in Louisville and Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia.\nThe incident also comes one day after Frey signed a temporary restraining order with the state to enforce immediate policing reforms like banning the use of chokeholds and requiring the police chief to authorize use of all crowd control weapons, WCCO reported.\nThe call to defund the department is one of several around the country following George Floyd's death in Minneapolis Police custody. Even the police chief has a storied past with the department he now leads, which has been marred with accusations of discrimination.\nIn 2007, Chief Arrandondo was one of five black Minneapolis police officers that alleged city leadership tolerated discrimination against people of color, including officers within their own department.\nA civil suit was filed by the officers based on \"their own experiences on the force from when they were recruits training through their present statuses at the time in '07,\" attorney John Klassen, who represented the officers, told CNN.\nMinneapolis schools and parks cut ties with police over George Floyd's death\nThe officers experienced their own individual \"employment discrimination\" while also \"watching the every day, every week, every year actions of white officers against citizens of color. Which they had to stand and watch and read about and hear about and see no action, effective action, taken against those officers for what they firmly believed were constitutional violations and discrimination in the police of Minneapolis to citizens,\" Klassen said.\nThere was no corrective action or admission of liability when the case was dismissed out of court with a settlement of more than $800,000, but Klassen said transitions to the new leadership in the department including Chief Arradondo, and the \"change in the mayoral leadership of the city has led to what appears to be an increase in recruiting of minority officers.\"\nEven with new leadership and enhanced awareness of racial inequality, Arrandondo told CNN's Sara Sidner last week that the department needs to to better.\n\"I did not need days or weeks or months or processes or bureaucracies to tell me what occurred out here last Monday was wrong,\" he added.\nHe said he held the four officers involved in the death of Floyd fully accountable and removed them from their duties, calling their actions a \"violation of humanity.\""}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/06/us/new-york-looting-intelligence-failure/index.html", "headline": "Looters were able to target high-end stores in New York due to an intelligence failure, NYPD official says", "published_date": "2020-06-07", "text": "(CNN)Looters in New York City were able to tear through some of the most expensive, high-end stores in the city because of an intelligence failure, according to a high-ranking police official.\nThe coordinated effort of looters to target the Manhattan neighborhood of SoHo without the police department's knowledge points to something the NYPD missed, said John Miller, the NYPD's chief of counterterrorism and intelligence.\n\"On the looting, that's an intelligence failure,\" Miller said at a briefing on Saturday. \"If a couple of hundred people knew to be in a certain place at a certain time for criminal activity and we didn't detect that, that's on me.

There was definitely organization, lots of cars here. A lot of people with a lot of bags.\"\nThe looting added another dimension to demonstrations that were sparked after George Floyd was killed in Minnesota.\nSo far, the NYPD has made 1,049 arrests as of Saturday morning, Miller said. More than 70% of the arrests were made in Manhattan and only a small number of those arrested, 119, were from outside of New York City, according to the NYPD.\nThe demonstrations and violence have reverberated among the NYPD's rank and file. There have been 292 police officers injured while two officers were suspended without pay because of their actions during the protests. A supervisor was reassigned, the NYPD said.\nMiller said the questions surrounding the intelligence failure only applies for the first night since after that new measures were immediately put into place to quell the chaos, including an 8 p.m. curfew, no traffic south of 96th Street, and no protesters allowed onto bridges past the 8 p.m. curfew, according to police.\n\"The looting was not a feature we anticipated, nor is it one we've seen before associated with these kinds of movements, nor do we actually believe that it's associated with this movement,\" Miller said. \"We believe it was an opportunist action by regular criminal groups who decided to exploit this. And we hear that increasingly from the groups that are marching that they have nothing to do with that and are trying to disassociate themselves.\"\nNYPD officials say they have differentiated between peaceful protesters, anarchist groups and looters when they all appear to be part of the same crowd but are not together. Miller highlighted that protesters have been disassociating themselves from both anarchists and looters.\nAt a George Floyd rally in Brooklyn on Wednesday, Miller said protesters alerted police to a vehicle with out-of-state license plates where the occupants inside wielded a knife and yelled at police before they were stopped. Inside the car was an accelerant for fires, other weapons and gas masks, police said.\n\"Looters break the windows and they were never interested in marching in the first place,\" Miller said. \"They want to go in and get merch.

Unprecedented curfews were still in place in major US cities, but thousands of people peacefully defied them, demonstrating late into the night. However, consequences from days of violent clashes are still being parsed out. Australia's Prime Minister has called for an investigation after two of the country's journalists were attacked Monday by police during a protest in Washington. And Facebook said it has shut down pages and accounts associated with a far-right group whose members were discussing bringing weapons to protests. Twitter made a similar move earlier in the week when it removed an account of a white supremacist group posing as Antifa activists.\nHide Caption\n231 of 231\nPhotos: A racial reckoning in America\nProtesters march in the street during a demonstration in Minneapolis on June 25.\nHide Caption\n1 of 231\n2. Coronavirus \nThere's more hopeful news in the quest for a coronavirus vaccine. Dr. Anthony Fauci says the US should have 100 million doses of one Covid-19 vaccine by the end of the year. The first viable vaccine candidate, made by biotech company Moderna, should go into the final stage of trials by mid-summer. This final stage will involve about 30,000 people between the ages of 18 and 55, as well as elderly patients and people who have underlying health conditions. Meanwhile, US Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams is warning that the ongoing protests could contribute to the nation's next spike in coronavirus cases. \nFauci shares optimistic hope on Covid-19 vaccines 01:20\n3. Election 2020\nSeveral states held primary elections yesterday, resulting in some notable down-ballot decisions. CNN projects that nine-term Congressman Steve King will lose his Republican primary in Iowa. King was ostracized in Washington and stripped of his committee assignments after questioning how \"white nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization\" became offensive. In Ferguson, Missouri, where the death of black teen Michael Brown set off weeks of nationwide outrage in 2014, voters elected their first black mayor. Ella Jones, who's worked as a chemist and church pastor, is also the first woman to hold that office. She has served on the Ferguson city council since 2015, when she was elected as its first African American member.\nSteve King loses Republican primary race, CNN projects 02:07\n4. Israel\nIsrael's Defense Minister Benny Gantz has told the army to step up preparations in parts of the West Bank, which could be a sign that the Israeli government will make an announcement on annexation in the next few weeks. Gantz's request to \"accelerate preparations\" is widely understood as a warning to prepare for possible widespread violence by Palestinians if Israel moves to annex some of the occupied territory. Such a move would fulfill a longtime campaign promise by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to extend the reach of Israeli sovereignty into parts of the West Bank, land captured by Israel in 1967.\nNetanyahu says he'll annex parts of West Bank if reelected (September) 02:13\n5. Republican National Convention\nThe Republican National Convention will not happen as envisioned in Charlotte, North Carolina. That's the word from GOP officials who say President Trump is following through on his threat to pull key parts of the convention from the state over Gov. Roy Cooper's refusal to budge on coronavirus precautions. Because of contractual agreements, the Republican National Committee still needs to hold some part of the convention there. But the most visible aspects, like the President's speech, will now likely be held elsewhere.

But the Knoxville native is candid about the racism she's faced during her ministry, including the past seven years as a community outreach director for an arm of the Southern Baptist Convention.\n\"Too many times to name, I have gone after a speaking event and wept in my hotel room,\" Newbell recalled in a recent interview, \"just realizing how deeply deceived some people are.\"\nSince the death of George Floyd in police custody in May, conservative White Christians have condemned racial injustice in unprecedented ways, with many acknowledging and pledging to fight the persistent scourge of systemic racism.\nWhite Christian leaders have prayed at vigils and marched in protests, damned the officers accused of killing Floyd and recited the slogan Black Lives Matter, often while distancing themselves from the organization of the same name. One evangelical magazine, Christianity Today, called for a church-led reparations project.\nBut even as they appreciate the scales falling from some White Christians' eyes, some Black Christians remain wary.\nTrillia Newbell says her faith has been tested by people who make racist comments.\nThat's especially true of those like Newbell who have spent significant time in predominantly White spaces. Many said they are bracing for a \"whitelash\" -- the moment White Christians tire of talking about race and bristle when Black pastors or congregants want to continue the conversation.\nNewbell said she is optimistic about the possibility of change, but is carefully guarding her heart. In the past, she's been told her interracial marriage is an affront to God, witnessed frustrated Black friends leave predominantly White churches, and -- too many times to count -- been expected to prove that anti-Black racism persists in America.\n\"It is so detrimental to someone's faith when your experience, your reality, is squashed because it's not the other person's reality,\" Newbell said. \"I have experienced that time and time again.\"\nThe sermon problem\nSunday morning has long been known as the \"segregated hour\" in American religious life, when many Black and White Christians worship the same God in separate sanctuaries.\nSome of the division may derive from the pastor's pulpit, according to recent public opinion surveys.\nMore than 6 in 10 Black Christians say it's important for sermons to address topics like racial relations and immigration, according to a recent Pew Research Center study. (Nearly a quarter called it \"essential.\")\nWhite Americans did not agree: More than 6 in 10 said those topics are not essential for pastor to examine, with 40% insisting that race and immigration should not be mentioned at all at church.\nPew's survey was conducted before Floyd's killing made international news and sparked nationwide protests. But Black Christians have been raising alarms about police brutality and systemic racism for decades.\nPastor Joel Osteen joins a march in honor of George Floyd on June 2, 2020, in Houston, Texas.\nAs recently as last summer, only 35% of White Christians said they were motivated to address racial injustice; and less than 2 in 5 believed the United States has a race problem, according to a 2019 poll by the Barna Research Group, a Christian public opinion firm based in California.\nMichael Emerson, a sociologist at the University of Illinois at Chicago, helped conduct that survey and is co-author of \"Divided by Faith,\" one of the most comprehensive surveys on race and religion in America.\n\"The racial gaps are huge on diagnosing the problem (of racism) and determining what we should do,\" he told CNN. \"There are even huge gaps on understanding what racism is and whether it's individual or systemic.\"\nSome of those gaps might have narrowed since Floyd's death. But, as some evangelicals acknowledge, that is not the only problem.\nThe theology problem\nLast month, the National Association of Evangelicals put together resources for churches and pastors to respond to racial injustice and encouraged its members to \"combat attitudes and systems that perpetuate racism.\"\nIt wasn't the first time the NAE, which represents some 45,000 local churches, has addressed systemic racism, said the Rev. Walter Kim, the association's president.\nAppointed last October, Kim is a Korean American and the first person of color to lead the NAE. He said he sees a broader, more active swath of evangelicals engaged on race in recent weeks.\nBut he also acknowledges that evangelicals haven't always been willing to address their racial history or see the wider repercussions of contemporary racism.\n\"There are streams of evangelicalism in which the issue of race has been woefully and inadequately addressed,\" Kim said.\nWalter Kim, president of the National Association of Evangelicals.\nEvangelicalism itself began as a spiritual renewal movement, with a primary focus on saving souls and fostering deeply personal encounters with Christ. Often, larger societal problems are seen as spiritual issues that can only be solved by salvation.\n\"The outworking of evangelicalism's public theology needs to catch up to its understanding of personal transformation,\" Kim said.\nBut like other evangelicals, Kim believes the wind has shifted since Floyd's killing.\n\"When America saw the death of George Floyd with their own eyes on a video played millions of times, it changed something,\" said Ronnie Floyd, a former Arkansas pastor who now heads the Southern Baptist Convention's executive committee.\n\"I really believe it will be a watershed moment for this country.\"\nFloyd, a longtime advocate of racial reconciliation, noted Southern Baptists' public apology in 1995 for its history of slaveowning and said there are a wide variety of views on race among Baptists. He also pointed out that 4,000 of the Southern Baptist Convention 47,000 churches are predominantly African American.\nRonnie Floyd, president of the Southern Baptist Convention, speaking on June 14, 2016, in St. Louis.\n\"Do we have a long way to go in the Southern Baptist Convention? Absolutely,\" Floyd continued. \"Are we making progress? Yes.\"\nBut there are caveats. Emerson noted that only 1% of White Christians worship in a racially mixed or predominantly African American church.\nNearly all of the increase in diverse congregations has been a result of Black and Latino Christians worshipping at predominantly White Churches -- where they haven't always had positive experiences.\nThe 'whitelash' problem\nJemar Tisby, author of \"The Color of Compromise,\" a book about White churches' complicity in racism, calls himself \"post-evangelical.\"\nThe Black Christian historian, who left his predominantly White denomination years ago, said he receives several messages per week from Christians looking to follow in his footsteps.\nHe says many write him after their White pastors minimize or try to explain away devastating incidents of anti-Black police brutality. They ask Tisby, should they leave?\n\"We are telling them to get out,\" he said. \"Especially at this moment, if your churches are not taking a strong stand on racial justice it's unlikely they ever will.\"\nEven when White churches say they are committed to addressing racism, their attention can be fleeting, said Dant\u00e9 Stewart, a writer and preacher in Augusta, Georgia.\nAn Easter sunrise service at Red Rocks Amphitheatre on April 21, 2019, in Morrison, Colorado.\nStewart, who was raised in Black churches, said he became immersed in White evangelicalism while playing football at Clemson University. After school, he and his wife worshipped at predominantly White churches.\nStewart said he was welcomed warmly -- until he started preaching about race. One church, which he declined to name, rescinded its offer to hire him as a pastor.\n\"Stew, you are making too much about race right now,\" he recalls one church leader saying. At the time, Stewart was writing articles in prominent evangelical magazines and being asked to speak on panels. But his church didn't want to hear about it.\nIt was a painful and exasperating experience, Stewart said.\n\"It was exhausting to stay in a White evangelical space,\" he said. \"They may have been around me, but they didn't love me and wouldn't fight for me. That's when I knew I had to leave and return to the Black church.\"\nKristina Brown Button, an author and advocate for racial justice, describes a similar sojourn through White Christianity.\nA mother of five who lives in Virginia, Button said she searched for 20 years to find a congregation and pastor who would make race and racism a top priority.\nShe recalls being the first Black member of her former church in Virginia Beach, which she joined with her future husband 20 years ago. There, Button said she endured years of isolation.\nWhite men addressed her White husband but failed to acknowledge her. Pastors proclaimed deep sadness about racism but were quick to move on to other issues, even after the shootings of Black men like Michael Brown demanded deeper responses.\nButton said she is heartened by what she hears now from White Christians. But experience has taught her that White Christians often balk when discussions get difficult and pastors dread offending White congregants.\n\"It's so rare to see White Christians stick with it unless they have a personal stake,\" Button said. \"I am not going to a predominantly White church again. It was just too painful.\"\nPastor Jevon Washington: \"This is the first time I am seeing White Christians responding in they way they have now.\"\nEven Black pastors said they have trouble engaging White Christians on race. Congregations are more than willing to tackle issues like homelessness and abortion, but racism is often deemed too \"political\" to touch, said Pastor Jevon Washington.\n\"Honestly, the church has been the worst when it comes to dealing with some of these things,\" said Washington, who worked at several predominantly White churches before settling in Rainier Valley in Washington. \"They just don't get it.\"\nSince Floyd's killing, more White Christians are joining the \"woke party,\" Washington said. But they are tardy and inconsistent allies.\n\"This is the first time I am seeing White Christians responding in the way they have now,\" said the pastor. \"But I am deeply saddened that it took a man getting murdered before their eyes to see the problem.\"\nThe Trump problem\nWhen 81% of White evangelicals voted for Donald Trump for president in 2016, some Black Christians viewed it as a betrayal.\n\"When presented with a choice between loving their black neighbors and supporting White supremacy, White Christians chose White power,\" said Stewart.\nIt's more complicated than that, White Christians have protested, arguing that there were many reasons to support Trump over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.\nThe Rev. Albert Mohler Jr., president of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, speaks to reporters in 2015.\n\"The disruption of our political system is not entirely attributable to Trump,\" said Albert Mohler, an influential Southern Baptist and president of the SBC's flagship seminary.\nMohler opposed Trump in 2016 but has said he will vote for the president in November. Evangelicals' political priorities should be abortion, adding conservative justices to the Supreme Court and protecting religious freedom, he said.\nThat's precisely the problem, say Black Christians. Challenging Trump's racial divisiveness is not a priority for too many White Christians, they say.\nFloyd, the head of Southern Baptists' executive committee, has also served on Trump's informal board of evangelical advisers. He said some evangelical leaders have called the White House to register objections \"when certain things happen that are not right.\"\n\"I don't think White evangelicals have been totally silent,\" he said, although he declined to offer specifics. \"Should they have been louder? Probably so.\"\nBut Floyd, who pastored a church for 35 years, said many local pastors are simply overwhelmed and often don't know enough to address difficult topics like racism.\nPresident Donald Trump holds up a Bible outside of St John's Episcopal church across Lafayette Park in Washington on June 1, 2020.\nThere's also the fact that when White Christians look at their congregations, they see a lot of Trump voters. According to a recent Pew poll, 8 in 10 White evangelicals said they would vote for him again.\nMeanwhile, nearly nine in 10 Black Americans do not think the president \"cares about people like you,\" according to a Fox News poll from last month.\nAnd therein lies perhaps the steepest obstacle to racial reconciliation.\nSome Black Christians have laid down a marker, saying that if White Christians vote for Trump in large numbers again, racial relations in this country may be irreparably harmed.\n\"If they have made all of these gestures in the wake of George Floyd's murder, only to go back to voting for a man who embodies racial bigotry,\" said Tisby, the historian, \"it will do more damage than if they had just remained silent.\"\nGeorge Floyd's death was a moment of racial reckoning for many White Christians. The presidential election in November will provide another.\nBlack Christians will be paying close attention."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/28/us/vancouver-city-council-police-reform-trnd/index.html", "headline": "Vancouver City Council moves to limit police response to issues around mental health, sex work and homelessness", "published_date": "2020-07-28", "text": "(CNN)Local politicians in Vancouver, Canada, are pushing to change its policing strategies, after its City Council passed a motion that would limit police response to mental health, substance abuse and other nonviolent issues -- working instead to fund a community-led initiative.\nThe council's Standing Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities approved the motion, titled \"Decriminalizing Poverty and Supporting Community-led Safety Initiatives,\" on Monday, after being introduced by Councillor Jean Swanson earlier this month.\n\"The City of Vancouver is committed to using an equity lens on social issues which include issues relating to police services,\" the motion reads, also noting that current policing practices disproportionately criminalize Black and Indigenous communities.\nThe motion asks the police board to itemize the work they do relating to mental health, homelessness, drug use and sex work, with the associated costs.

The interview has been edited for length and clarity.\nQ: Minnesota is known for having a large Somali immigrant community. How have they been impacted by George Floyd's death and by the protests, and how have you seen Somali immigrants responding?\nA: The Somalis are also black and they've been disproportionately affected by the police activities. And if you go to the protests, they are more highly visible than before. The younger generation clearly came out this time. Probably they have more interactions with the police than their parents or they can relate more with the African American experience than their parents. I used to cover protests before. And this is completely different. I saw a lot of young Somalis participating, especially young females, wearing the hijab and all that.\nWe talked to a lot of people who say they are afraid of the police. When they see a police officer, they tense up. And those experiences show the lack of trust between the black community and the police. And it doesn't matter whether you are a new immigrant or whether you were born here or whether your parents fled from civil war it's almost the same experience as the African American community.\nHide Caption\n231 of 231\nPhotos: A racial reckoning in America\nProtesters march in the street during a demonstration in Minneapolis on June 25.\nHide Caption\n1 of 231\nQ: And you mentioned that there can be kind of a generation gap between older Somalis and younger Somalis. Why is that?\nA: The older generation, some of them fled civil war. They went through traumatizing events. They came here to have a better life and to raise a family, and all that, so they are probably more grateful to be here. And, you know, while their kids who were born here don't have all that baggage, they see what's going on. These kids, they went through the educational system. They have more history under their belt. They learned about inequalities and they experience them themselves on the streets. And that kind of creates a gap.\nQ: I have seen some stories quoting Somalis talking about how they survived war, and they came to this country as refugees in search of safety, and now they're finding themselves in the midst of this situation. Is that something you've been seeing? What is it like for them and what is it like for you, as someone who came to the US from Somalia years ago, to see violence erupting in this country?\nA: I mean, the dynamics are different. But, you know, at the end of the day, it's violence. And you know, buildings burned down and looting and all of that, some people get flashbacks because this reminds them of what they have fled.\nBut we know what's causing this. And that makes a difference. In Somalia, people were fighting against each other. It was a civil war. Here it's completely different. It's a system against people. And you cannot compare those two. Here there are protests. If something is burned down, you can always rebuild a building that's been damaged. But, the killing of George Floyd really shows how the system affects people.\nQ: There's also a geographic connection, right, between the Somali community and the part of Minneapolis where Mr. Floyd was killed?\nA: Yeah, that area is actually one of the most diverse places in Minneapolis. There are a lot of immigrant-owned businesses and community centers and mosques. And it's a vibrant corridor. And it's the heart of a lot of Latino-owned and Somali-owned businesses. If you look at the stores damaged or businesses being affected, it's predominately immigrant-owned.\nQ: What do you want the world to know about the situation you're seeing unfolding in your community right now? When you see national coverage of George Floyd's death and the protests in Minneapolis, what are the stories you think aren't being told that should be?\nA: I think the human toll of this is something that I haven't seen really being covered. The coverage tends to be a little bit disconnected from what people are feeling, their experiences, how they have been through this multiple times, how it's affecting them, the trauma that this causes -- the generational trauma. These kids, their parents, their grandparents, it's something that has been going on for centuries. I think that hasn't been explored enough. And, you know, the media tend to carry the official narrative and give more weight to that than the human voices and the community voices. I hope they will shift the focus a little bit and make it more human-centric, more community-centric than just you know, quoting talking heads or quoting officials.\nYou see young people being really frustrated and you wonder why. Why is everyone frustrated? Why do they hate the police? Why the cursing at the police? What's causing that? I'm always more curious to learn about that than just covering the latest developments.\nQ: And in conversations that you and your colleagues have been having with people, how have they been answering that question? Why are they feeling this way?\nA: They're saying the police harass them, they intimidate them even if they don't do anything. They stop them when they're even walking down the street. And that way of policing is something that really frustrates people. ... You know, when you're interacting with the young black person really upset and crying and afraid of the police, it breaks your heart. And that's not what probably the white community experiences. And you just ask, why?\nProtester's message for looters: Something is wrong with you 01:31\nQ: What has it been like for your site to be covering this moment in Minnesota's history, and in the United States' history?\nA: We are a small staff. We have been trying to really tackle this from unique angles because it's something affecting a lot of people. So if you look at our coverage, we have written about the young Somalis, we have written about how the Asian community is being targeted. One of the officers is Hmong, and some people target people who have similar last names as the police officer. We have been covering how the immigrant businesses have been damaged during the protests.\nQ: What has stood out or surprised you as someone who is an expert in covering these communities and has been doing it for a while?\nA: The diversity of the protesters. It's really a lot of different communities, ethnic backgrounds. This case really hit a nerve and you can see that on the street. ... I've lived here for almost 16 years. I have never seen anything like this."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/22/us/rhode-island-plantation-name-change-trnd/index.html", "headline": "Rhode Island's formal name is 'the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations.'

The US considers Huawei a national security risk, fearing its equipment could be used by the Chinese government for spying. The US has already levied sanctions and bans against the firm, and experts think the UK's decision resulted from pressure from across the pond and US warnings that using Chinese 5G vendors could jeopardize US-UK intelligence ties.

I don't agree with breaking into all of the businesses, but I can understand the outrage after repeated incidents. We've peacefully protested all of those... it wasn't until Minneapolis got violent they finally arrested a police officer. This is truly history in the fact that there's actual action being taken against police brutality. I couldn't stay silent and watch this happen again. I'm hoping this time -- our nation can see the severity of this climate.\n\"I'm a white woman, and I needed to show up for all my brothers and sisters. I needed to show that this isn't okay to ME. That could be my friend. I needed to be there and show I want change.\"\nCharlotte, North Carolina\nCraig Maxwell, protester\n\"I've been talking to several of my black friends the last day or two and hearing what they're going through. A lot of introspection and recognizing that I don't put my money where my mouth is enough.

It can't be about me; otherwise, it won't work. I needed to step up my advocacy. I showed myself more of what I was capable of tonight and it helped me connect to purpose for why I should protest. As uncomfortable as I may have been, not everyone gets to walk away from the situation just because it's uncomfortable...

Four now-fired officers face charges in that case, including one who is accused of second-degree murder.\nThere have been protests in Tacoma over Ellis' death.\nEllis died of respiratory arrest due to hypoxia caused by physical restraint, the Pierce County Medical Examiner's Office determined. Hypoxia is a condition in which the body is deprived of adequate oxygen supply.\nEllis was black; two of the four officers in his case are white, one is black and one is Asian, according to police.\nVideo shows a woman being body slammed by an Atlanta police officer as she was handcuffed\nThe Tacoma Police Union wrote in a statement Thursday the mayor passed judgment on the four officers \"without any facts, without an investigation, without due process, and with less than a minute of short, blurry, partial Twitter videos in hand.\"\n\"She called them criminals. She called for their prosecution. She called for their termination from employment. And she called for all of these things without an ounce of evidence to support her words beyond misplaced rage,\" the union's statement read.\nThe union also addressed the death of Floyd, saying it was wrong and \"repugnant to the badge\" and humanity.\n\"But understand; Tacoma is not Minneapolis.

When the 43-year-old Muhaymin \u2014 who struggled with mental illness and intermittent homelessness \u2014 tried to carry his emotional support dog, a Chihuahua named Chiquita, into the restroom of a community service center, the manager physically blocked him from entering the men's room and asked him to leave the dog outside. An argument ensued, and the manager instructed an employee to call 911.\nThis triggered a response by a handful of Phoenix police officers who in the bodycam footage initially appear to defuse the situation by allowing Muhaymin to use the men's room.\nBut during their fateful six-minute wait for Muhaymin to exit, officers conducted a background search and discovered a warrant on his record for failure to appear in court over a charge stemming from misdemeanor possession of a marijuana pipe. (That confiscation was the result of a 2016 stop by a police officer for jaywalking in nearby Mesa, Arizona.)\nWhen Muhaymin emerged from the restroom, the situation swiftly spiraled out of control. Officers tried to arrest him, and ultimately Muhaymin wound up facedown on the pavement just outside the facility with at least four officers on top of him struggling to put his hands in cuffs. Within eight minutes, Muhaymin was dead. His dog has not been seen since.\nThe Muhaymin family is suing the city for $10 million in a wrongful death suit that names 10 Phoenix police officers as defendants and is expected to go to jury trial early next year.\n\"In general, sending out armed police officers with guns to deal with somebody who's having a mental breakdown \u2014 it's a recipe for disaster,\" said the family's attorney, David Chami.\nMuhaymin's emotional support dog, a Chihuahua named Chiquita\nAlthough the circumstances of the Floyd and Muhaymin cases share uncanny similarities, the impact they've had in terms of public awareness and consequences to the officers involved are a world apart.\nIn the case of Floyd, all four officers involved were terminated and are now facing criminal charges.\nIn the case of Muhaymin, none of the officers who responded to the call faced any discipline. All of them remain on the force; one is now a detective.\nThe Phoenix Police Department \u2014 one of the largest in the United States without civilian oversight \u2014 conducted its own investigation and found the officers committed no wrongdoing, according to Chami. (In response to a public records request, the police department has declined to provide CNN with the results of its investigation. The department said none of the officers' actions on that day was found to be \"out of policy.\")\n\"The department is investigating itself here,\" Chami said. \"There's an incentive to find no wrongdoing.\"\nThe Maricopa County Attorney's Office reviewed the Phoenix Police Department's internal probe and determined that the officers \"did not commit any act that warrants criminal prosecution,\" according to a letter dated February 22, 2018, provided to CNN.\nWhy medical experts disagree on the cause of death\nA Maricopa County medical examiner, Dr. Amanda Maskovyak, has labeled Muhaymin's death a homicide \u2014 a technical term meaning somebody died at the hands of another. Maskovyak listed the primary cause of death to be cardiac arrest, aggravated by \"coronary artery disease, psychiatric disease, acute methamphetamine intoxication and physical exertion during law enforcement subdual.\"\nThe family's expert witness, Dr. Bennet Omalu, disagrees.\n\"Asphyxiation due to compression of his trunk and body\" \u2014 not underlying conditions or drug use \u2014 was the cause of death, said Omalu, a forensic pathologist known for his research on chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) injuries in football players, and who was portrayed by Will Smith in the 2015 film \"Concussion.\"\nBy the time Muhaymin vomited, his body had been compressed under the weight of the officers for eight minutes, Omalu wrote in a report for the family's attorney. This \"high-scale traumatic stressor\" caused Muhaymin to vomit, which entered and blocked his air passageways, cutting off oxygen to his brain and leading to \"sudden death,\" Omalu's report says.\nThe report, exclusively obtained by CNN, concludes: \"If Muhammad did not encounter the police on Jan. 4, 2017, he would not have died.\"\nA spokesperson with the Phoenix Police Department said they are constrained by litigation from commenting extensively about the Muhaymin case.\n\"The Phoenix Police Department is committed to the safety and security of each person in our community,\" the spokesperson said in a statement to CNN. \"It is our goal to be accountable and transparent with our community while providing information related to critical incidents.\"\nPhoenix Mayor Kate Gallego declined to comment for this story.\nThe city of Phoenix has been wrestling with accusations of police brutality for the past several years. In 2018, it led the nation in fatal officer-involved shootings, with 23 deaths, according to a report by the National Police Foundation. The City Council voted this past February to establish a police oversight agency, which will launch next year.\nThe raw, unedited footage obtained by CNN includes bodycam videos supplied to Muhaymin's family through litigation. It brings to light several revealing moments that are not included in bodycam footage already released by the city, including how the officers speak about Muhaymin and his dog while he is in the restroom, out of earshot.\nThe footage also shows that the officers suspected that Muhaymin had mental health issues.\nAnd the footage, unlike what has been released by the city, provides the clearest visual yet of an officer pinning Muhaymin against the pavement with a knee shortly before he dies.\nAn image taken from an officer's bodycam video shows Muhaymin pressed to the pavement by the officers.\nIn legal filings, the city says Muhaymin \"assaulted a government employee,\" even though the manager can be seen in the bodycam footage saying he wasn't assaulted.\nThe court document also invokes qualified immunity, a controversial defense that grants special protection to officers accused of violating the Constitution. It argues that the dog was unleashed and \"out of control\" when Muhaymin was arrested, and that the force used against Muhaymin was \"both reasonable and necessary, given his behavior.\"\nThe city in the document says Muhaymin \"tensed up, thrashed about, pushed and kicked at officers.\"\nAlthough Muhaymin appears in the videos to at times resist being cuffed \u2014 tensing up his arms or refusing to offer up his hands, for instance \u2014 none of the footage shows him kicking or punching any officers. Officers stated that Muhaymin \"did not attempt to kick, bite, slap or otherwise harm the officers but that he was 'passive aggressive' and resisting arrest,\" according to the medical examiner's report.\nNor do the recordings show officers kicking or punching Muhaymin, though at one point an officer's elbow strikes his shoulder.\nBut the videos show several officers putting their weight on Muhaymin for several minutes at a time as he screams and groans.\n\"There's no reason why he should have lost his life at the hands of police in the way he did,\" said Carlos Garcia, a Phoenix city councilman. \"Screaming out for his dog, screaming out for help.\"\nWhat happened during Muhaymin's final hour\nYears ago, Muhaymin \u2014 the father of a grown son and teenaged daughter \u2014 had been a garbage-truck driver in Phoenix. In the early 1990s, he traveled as a backup dancer with his sister Tonya Davis, a rapper who performed under the name \"Overweight Pooch,\" the Arizona Republic reported.\nHe was close with his namesake father, and when his father died in 2006, Muhaymin's mental health began to deteriorate \u2014 to the point where, shortly before his death, he fell into homelessness, another of his three sisters, Mussallina Muhaymin, told CNN.\nPhoenix police shot and killed a man in a parked car, sparking renewed protests\nMuhaymin died on a typical sunny winter morning in Maryvale, a neighborhood or \"urban village\" of Phoenix with a history of crime issues.\nA few years ago, the area drew some bizarre headlines for reports of roving packs of wild Chihuahuas, a claim that has been challenged by the local press.\nAround 9:30 a.m. on January 4, 2017, Muhaymin walked into the Maryvale Community Center, where Phoenix residents come to play basketball, take classes or check out books from the nearby library, among other things. He was carrying his Chihuahua.\nMuhaymin \u2014 who suffered from schizophrenia and anxiety, according to mental health documents obtained by CNN \u2014 lived outside in a makeshift encampment with a handful of other homeless people near the center, Chami said. All of his sisters lived nearby.\nA security guard at a nearby hospital in Maryvale \u2014 which has since shuttered \u2014 told police Muhaymin had occasionally showed up to wash himself and his dog in the restroom, and had behaved erratically, such as by practicing martial arts in the lobby, sometimes with a long stick.\nMuhaymin \u2014 a 5-foot, 7-inch man who wore dreadlocks \u2014 was also familiar to employees at the community center, where he'd taken his dog before. This time, an employee dialed 911.\n\"He's been here many times before and refused to leave,\" the employee tells the dispatcher in the call. The employee describes Muhaymin as \"confrontational,\" adding that Muhaymin was \"shoving\" her supervisor \u2014 the manager \u2014 and \"yelling\" at him.\nFour officers \u2014 Oswald Grenier, Jason Hobel, Ronaldo Canilao and David Head \u2014 arrived to find Muhaymin and the manager by the door of the restroom, arguing animatedly about the unleashed dog in Muhaymin's arms.\nThe bodycam footage shows Hobel interrupting the argument to ask the manager if he'd been assaulted by Muhaymin.\nMuhaymin looks taken aback.\n\"Who said anything about assault?\" he asks.\n\"I'm asking the question,\" Hobel answers, raising his voice. \"You're ranting and raving getting nowhere, and I'm asking a question: Did he assault you, sir?\"\nIn a key moment, the manager answers: \"No. He was trying to get in and I didn't let him in. So, we bumped into each other.\"\n(The manager later told officers that Muhaymin pushed him, and that he returned the shove, according to police reports.)\nAn officer says he and his colleagues were responding to a reported assault, and that after Muhaymin used the restroom, they would leave.\nBut that didn't happen. In the footage, when Muhaymin is in the restroom, Grenier tells other officers that he'd \"dealt with\" Muhaymin before.\nHe adds: \"The dog is not a service dog.\"\n(CNN has obtained documentation from Muhaymin's case manager that references his dog for \"emotional support.\")\nGrenier runs the background check and discovers the warrant out of Mesa, a suburb of Phoenix.\nAn officer asks the others what to do with the \"rat dog.\" Another responds, \"Throw him in the back of my car and we'll drive him down to the shelter.\nIn an indication that they think Muhaymin is troubled, Hobel, who previously had responded to calls involving him, remarks that \"he is a little 918\" \u2014 police code for mentally ill.\nWhy Muhaymin wouldn't let go of his dog\nMuhaymin eventually emerges from the bathroom and walks past the officers and through the lobby. They follow. One of them makes small talk, asking about the name of his dog.\nBut when Muhaymin exits the building, the dynamic changes. Grenier orders Muhaymin to stop and informs him of the warrant.\nWe offer several ways to reach our journalists securely.\n\"A warrant?\" Muhaymin asks, in apparent confusion. \"Hold on.\"\nThe officers surround him and order him to let go of the dog.\n\"If that dog bites me, it's going to be a bad day,\" an officer warns.\nThey push him up against the glass wall of the basketball court in attempt to grab his hands, which are tucked in front of his body while still holding the dog, according to the police incident report.\nThe officers pry the dog loose from his hands; the Chihuahua lands on her feet and runs off.\nMuhaymin cries out. The dog barks. The officers try to wrestle Muhaymin to the ground.\nBodycam footage shows an officer holding Muhaymin down with a knee to the head as the dog watches.\nFor a moment, as officers walk a handcuffed Muhaymin to a police cruiser, it seems as though the worst is over.\n\"That's my child, officer,\" Muhaymin pleads, referring to his dog running loose.\nHow a disastrous sequence of events played out\nBut as they proceed to the police vehicle, Hobel says he thinks Muhaymin could have a knife and so instead of putting him inside, they decide to search him against the vehicle's hood, according to the police incident report. A disastrous sequence of events follows.\nIn a move that Chami believes caused serious injury, Muhaymin's cuffed hands are raised over his head from behind his back. Muhaymin screams.\n\"Unless you're a contortionist, you're not going to be able to do that,\" Chami said.\nMuhaymin cries out: \"I cannot believe this.\"\nAn officer says, \"f**king relax, dumbass.\"\nThe officers wrestle Muhaymin to the pavement on his side. The dog barks.\nAgain, an officer pins Muhaymin's head to the pavement with a knee, while three others apply weight on Muhaymin's waist and shoulders.\nMuhaymin can be heard yelling, \"I can't breathe\" at least four times. He screams.\nAdditional officers arrive. The officers uncuff him. An officer places a restraint around Muhaymin's feet, according to police reports. The officers put the handcuffs back on and connect the cuffs to the ankle restraint with a strap, according to the medical examiner.\nTim Scott says he's moved back to the 'drawing board' on police reform\nMuhaymin vomits and goes limp. The officers move Muhaymin away from the vomit, remove the rope and restraints, call for medics and \u2014 when they see he is not breathing \u2014 administer chest compressions, according to the medical examiner.\nOmalu's report says Muhaymin stopped breathing and \"no pulse was detected\" at 10:04 a.m.\n\"There were at least six officers who were on top of Muhammad or pressed (Muhammad) prone on the sidewalk,\" Omalu's report says.\nMuhaymin was transported by ambulance to nearby Maryvale Hospital, which has since closed and reopened under new ownership. There, at 10:39 a.m. \u2014 a little more than an hour after he'd walked into the community center to use the restroom \u2014 he was pronounced dead.\nPolice summoned animal control. An officer from the pound arrived and took the dog. But instead of impounding her, the officer gave the Chihuahua to a man at the scene who called himself a friend of Muhaymin's, according to a police report. Chami said a witness told him the man is homeless. In any case, Chami said, the family hasn't seen the dog since the incident.\nPolice say Muhaymin committed 'assault'\nEven though police and witnesses later said Muhaymin did not become physically violent during the encounter, the authorities initially told local media outlets that Muhaymin had committed \"assault\" against an officer and an employee.\n\"When did they ever retract those statements?\" Chami said, referring to the police. \"They never did.\"\nChami said he would like to see the criminal investigation reopened, as was done recently in Colorado, where the governor in late June ordered a new examination into the death of Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old Black man who died from a heart attack shortly after police put him in a chokehold.\nAn attorney representing the officers in Muhaymin's case declined to comment.\nMussallina Muhaymin, Muhammad's sister, said the police department never apologized to her family. She added that the police sent flowers to his funeral \u2014 a gesture that struck lher as hollow.\n\"In taking his life, flowers actually, absolutely serve no purpose, other than add salt to the wound,\" she said. \"Simply because, you know, I would prefer that my brother were standing there, and I was able to hug him and have a conversation with him.\"\nMussallina lamented the current lack of independent police oversight in Phoenix.\n\"The police was judge, jury and executioner,\" she said. \"And just because he wanted to use a public bathroom.\""}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/30/us/blm-mural-spokane-wa-trnd/index.html", "headline": "A Black Lives Matter mural is defaced with red, white and blue paint in Washington state", "published_date": "2020-07-30", "text": "(CNN)A colorful Black Lives Matter mural was defaced this week, with vandals attempting to obscure \"Black\" with red, white and blue paint.\nThe 140-foot mural is on the side of a building in downtown Spokane, Washington -- sponsored in part by Terrain, a local arts nonprofit.

Here's what it means", "published_date": "2020-06-07", "text": "(CNN)There's a growing group of dissenters who believe Americans can survive without law enforcement as we know it. And Americans, those dissenters believe, may even be better off without it.\nThe solution to police brutality and racial inequalities in policing is simple, supporters say: Just defund police.\nIt's as straightforward as it sounds: Instead of funding a police department, a sizable chunk of a city's budget is invested in communities, especially marginalized ones where much of the policing occurs.\nThe concept's been a murmur for years, particularly following the protests against police brutality in Ferguson, Missouri, though it seemed improbable in 2014.\nBut it's becoming a shout. With the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor at the hands of police and nationwide protests demanding reform, Minneapolis officials announced their intent to defund and disband the city's police force altogether.\nDoes defunding the police mean disbanding the police?\nThat depends on whom you ask, said Philip McHarris, a doctoral candidate in sociology at Yale University and lead research and policy associate at the Community Resource Hub for Safety and Accountability.\nSome supporters of divestment want to reallocate some, but not all, funds away from police departments to social services and reduce their contact with the public to reduce the likelihood of police violence.\nThose seeking to disband police consider defunding an initial step toward creating an entirely different model of community-led public safety.\nThe concept exists on a spectrum, and the two aren't dichotomous but interconnected. But both interpretations center on reimagining what public safety looks like -- shifting resources away from law enforcement toward community resources, he said.\nIt also means dismantling the idea that police are \"public stewards\" meant to protect communities. Many Black Americans and other people of color don't feel protected by police, McHarris said.\nProtestors are tear gassed as police disperse them near the White House.\nWhy defund police?\nMcHarris says divesting funds can begin the process of ending the culture of punishment in the criminal justice system. And it's one of the only options local governments haven't tried in their attempts to end deaths in police custody.\nTrainings and body cameras haven't brought about the change supporters want.\nMcHarris grew up in a neighborhood where there were \"real, discernible threats of gun violence,\" and he said he never thought to call the police -- that was for his own safety. Instead, he relied on neighbors who helped him navigate threats of danger.\nWhat if, he said, those people could provide the same support they showed him on a full-time basis?\nTo explain why he supports the idea, Isaac Bryan, the director of UCLA's Black Policy Center, points to history: Law enforcement in the South began as slave patrol, a team of vigilantes hired to recapture escaped slaves. Then, when slavery was abolished, police enforced Jim Crow laws -- even the most minor infractions.\nAnd today, police disproportionately use force against black people, and black people are more likely to be arrested and sentenced.\n\"That history is engrained in our law enforcement,\" Bryan said.\nPolice arrest a protester on Fifth Avenue during a march in Manhattan.\nWhere would those funds go?\nPatrisse Cullors, co-founder of the Black Lives Matter movement, said defunding the police means reallocating those funds to support people and services in marginalized communities.\nDefunding law enforcement \"means that we are reducing the ability for law enforcement to have resources that harm our communities,\" Cullors said in an interview with WBUR, Boston's public radio station. \"It's about reinvesting those dollars into black communities, communities that have been deeply divested from.\"\nThose dollars can be put back into social services for mental health, domestic violence and homelessness, among others. Police are often the first responders to all three, she said.\nThose dollars can be used to fund schools, hospitals, housing and food in those communities, too -- \"all of the things we know increase safety,\" McHarris said.\nNew York Police Department officers stand in formation after arresting multiple protesters marching after curfew on Fifth Avenue in New York.\nWhy disband police?\nDisbanding police altogether falls on the more radical end of the police divestment spectrum, but it's gaining traction.\nMPD150, a community advocacy organization in Minneapolis, focuses on abolishing local police. Its work has been spotlighted since the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis Police custody.\n\"The people who respond to crises in our community should be the people who are best-equipped to deal with those crises,\" the organization says.\nRather than \"strangers armed with guns,\" the organization says, first responders should be mental health providers, social workers, victim advocates and other community members in less visible roles.\nIt argues law and order isn't abetted by law enforcement, but through education, jobs and mental health services that low-income communities are often denied. MPD150 and other police abolition organizations want wider access to all three.\nProtesters take a knee in front of New York City police officers.\nWould defunding police lead to an uptick in violent crimes?\nDefunding police on a large scale hasn't been done before, so it's tough to say.\nBut there's evidence that less policing can lead to less crime. A 2017 report, which focused on several weeks in 2014 through 2015 when the New York Police Department purposely pulled back on \"proactive policing,\" found that there were 2,100 fewer crime complaints during that time.\nThe study defines proactive policing as the \"systematic and aggressive enforcement of low-level violations\" and heightened police presence in areas where \"crime is anticipated.\"\nThat's exactly the kind of activity that police divestment supporters want to end.\nMinneapolis Police and Minnesota State Patrol form a police line.\nWill defunding the police come to pass?\nIt's radical for an American city to operate without law enforcement, but the plan is already in motion in Minneapolis.\nOn Sunday, nine members of the Minneapolis city council announced they intend to disband the city's police force entirely.\n\"We committed to dismantling policing as we know it in the city of Minneapolis and to rebuild with our community a new model of public safety that actually keeps our community safe,\" Council President Lisa Bender told CNN.\nBender said the council still needs to discuss what to replace police with, but that the city would funnel money from police into \"community-based strategies.\" She noted, too, that most 911 calls are for mental health services, health and EMT and fire services.\nDefunding is simpler than disbanding, though, and at least one mayor's already taken that step. After Californians decried a proposal to increase the Los Angeles Police Department budget to $1.86 billion, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti agreed to slash between $100 million to $150 million from the proposed funding.\nIt's not a significant dent in the budget, but it's proof that officials are listening, Bryan said.\n\"A week ago, defunding the police in any capacity would sound like 'pie in the sky,'\" he said. \"Now we're talking about it. Defunding police in its entirety still might sound like 'pie in the sky,' but next week might be different.\""}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/05/us/new-york-lawyers-molotov-cocktail/index.html", "headline": "Two New York lawyers are in custody in connection with a Molotov cocktail attack on a police patrol car during weekend protests", "published_date": "2020-06-06", "text": "(CNN)Two attorneys were taken back into custody Friday for charges in connection with a Molotov cocktail attack on a police patrol car during protests in Brooklyn last weekend in the wake of George Floyd's death.\nA federal appeals court ruled they should not remain in home detention while prosecutors appeal their bail decision.

Page initially claimed that she was assaulted, Brown said.\nOther historic accounts say Rowland tripped leaving the elevator, grabbed Page's arm, she screamed and an onlooker went to authorities.\nWhile Page never pressed charges, authorities did, and by the end of the day the rumor was that Page had been raped.\nWhite armed mobs storm Greenwood\nOn May 31, a group of black and white men confronted each other at the courthouse where Roland was being held. After shots were fired, all hell broke loose.\nOutnumbered African Americans retreated to Greenwood District, but early morning the next day, a white mob started to loot and burn businesses in Greenwood, according to the Tulsa Historical Society and Museum.\nIn a span of just 24 hours, 35 square blocks were burned and over 1,200 houses destroyed. Contemporary reports of deaths began at 36, but historians now believe as many as 300 people died, according to the Tulsa Historical Society and Museum.\nPhoto shows the aftermath of the white mobs that attacked black residents and businesses of the Greenwood District in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\nAt the end of the violence, Black Wall Street had been decimated.

Some have described the actions of these select creators as \"shameless.\"\n\"People feel that it's okay to use protest and other tragic situations as political theater as props because they don't have a sense of consequences or propriety. It's shameless,\" Roberto Blake, an influencer, entrepreneur and educator, told CNN over Twitter.\n\"Whether it's an Instagram model in the streets or our leaders abusing sacred symbols, it's distasteful and entitled. If they put that time into planning a shoot instead into becoming educated about the issues, they wouldn't even contemplate it.\"\n'A lot of people do this kind of stuff'\nMike Metzler, a digital marketing manager, characterized the type of behavior exhibited by Schatzel and others as \"influencer opportunism.\"\n\"When you're an influencer and 'making content' is your job, you can begin to view every experience and part of your life as a 'possible' piece of content,\" Metzler told CNN over Twitter. \"This becomes a habit and a way of life for many influencers. But the truth is, not everything needs to be content, and there are certain situations where you really need to pause and read the room.\"\nTaylor Lorenz, a New York Times reporter who covers internet culture, said this type of opportunism isn't new.\nLast year, she wrote an article for The Atlantic about the backlash some influencers received after visiting Pripyat, Ukraine, the city left in ruin after the nuclear disaster at the Chernobyl power plant in 1986. The location spiked in popularity last summer due to the hit HBO miniseries \"Chernobyl.\"\nIn a way, what influencers did at Chernobyl is similar to what they've been seen doing around the US over the past few weeks, Lorenz told CNN.\n\"Influencer culture is so pervasive now,\" Lorenz said in a phone interview. \"Everyone is trying to capture their experiences and communicate their feelings about this very fraught subject and racism in general.\"\n\"This woman obviously missed the mark but a lot of people do this kind of stuff,\" Lorenz said, referring to Schatzel.\nA notable example of another influencer turning the demonstrations into an excuse to promote themselves involved one of YouTube's biggest stars.\nEarlier this month, Jake Paul was charged with criminal trespass and unlawful assembly after video showed him at a Scottsdale, Arizona, mall as it was being looted, police said.\nThe 23-year-old, who has 20.1 million followers on YouTube, was present during the looting and property destruction that happened at the city's Fashion Square mall on May 30, the Scottsdale Police Department said in a Facebook post.\nVideo taken by his photographer and posted by another user to Twitter appeared to show Paul outside the mall as people were attempting to break in.\n'People go to protests to be heard': Reflections on the '60s and today\nLater, the footage appears to show him inside the mall along with others after it had closed. It is unclear whether Paul took anything, and he has not been charged with any theft or vandalism that occurred.\nPaul, whose older brother Logan Paul is also a famous YouTube creator, said that he nor anyone else he was with was engaged in looting or vandalism, and that his group was tear gassed by police.\nThis isn't the first time Paul has faced controversy. He was booted from Disney Channel in 2017, and has since utilized his online popularity -- most notably from the former short-form video platform Vine -- to keep eyeballs on his content. He's been called out for his bad behavior many times, but continues to remain popular.\nSome, like Blake, hope Paul's most recent public controversy will become a \"teachable moment.\"\n\"My thought and hope is that this is a teachable moment for him as well as his audience and also his peers and that the right lessons are learned from it,\" Blake said, adding he doesn't know Paul personally. \"But I have no interest in condemning him or canceling, and even I did it would just be a distraction for the more important and more relevant issues that need to be addressed.\"\nHow to leave 'influencer opportunism' behind\nEven after the apology, Schatzel told CNN she feels she has ruined her reputation and career \"because of a picture.\"\n\"The backlash has been defamatory toward me as a woman and a human being; they (are) calling out for my public rape, murder threats, public lynching over a picture,\" she said. \"I can't wrap my head around this kind of backlash.\"\nBut some in the creator community are giving her the benefit of the doubt.\nGabrielle Epstein, an influencer with 2.3 million followers on Instagram, said she felt uncomfortable by Schatzel's post but understood Schatzel likely \"had good intentions.\"\n\"I think the spotlight needs to be about the movement as a whole rather than the individual,\" Epstein told CNN. \"We are all human, we all make mistakes, and in the era of social media have become frighteningly quick to judge and criticize others. The important thing is that we learn from those mistakes in order to do and be better.\"\nDue to the nature of social media, it's easy for influencers to \"become accustomed to posting things whether it be for 'likes' and validation without even thinking,\" beauty vlogger Nicol Concilio told CNN in an email interview.\nThese people should instead try to spread awareness and be a positive avenue for change, Concilio added.\nKenzie Brenna, another social media influencer who has almost 300,000 followers on Instagram, echoed that sentiment.\n\"My advice to influencers is to check yourselves, are you serving the collective good or are you serving yourself?\" Brenna, who hosts a podcast called \"Conversations with Kenzie,\" told CNN in an email interview.\n\"Do your morals extend beyond getting likes and attention?

You may not like the answer\nThe participants' answers showed that they view a \"typical woman\" as being similar to a White woman rather than a Black woman, and that Black women have more similarities with Black men than they do White women or men.\nThe study also revealed that prototypes of groups made up of various race and gender intersections continuously erase and exclude Black women, which is likely the reason why feminist and anti-racist movements often fail to address the concerns of Black women.\n\"The operative word in defining how similar to other groups Black women are is more 'Black' and less 'women,'\" the study said.\n\"The underdifferentiation of Black women from Black men may also explain why movements against anti-Black racism have often been criticized for not doing enough to address the issues that affect Black women \u2014 not because people necessarily do not think of Black women as Black people, but because people think of Black women similarly to how they think of Black men. As a result, a one-size-fits-all approach to anti-Black racism leaves Black women's concerns overlooked.\"\nAlexis Bass, a 22-year-old Black activist and artist who organizes with the Black Lives Matter movement in Georgia, agrees with the study's findings.\nPhotos: A racial reckoning in America\nShe says Black community issues often overshadow Black women's issues, which can be unique and complex. Diverse movements think of Black men and women as facing the same struggle. Meanwhile, the black community may prioritize issues of race over gender or sexuality. This leaves Black women feeling excluded from women's movements and marginalized in their own community.\n\"Injustice against Black women affects the entire community, but sometimes we're at the bottom of the totem pole,\" Bass said.\nAs evidence, Bass pointed to nationwide protests over the death of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man killed by a Minneapolis police officer in late May. Bass noted that Breonna Taylor, an unarmed Black woman killed by police in Louisville, Kentucky, in March didn't garner nearly as much attention.\n\"All of these cases affect my community as a whole, but when it comes to Black women sharing experiences and injustices, our word and our lives suddenly don't matter.\"\nThe exclusion of Black women puts them at risk for greater harm, the study said.\n\"Intersectional invisibility suggests that Black women may be harmed when their unique experiences of both racism and sexism go unappreciated by larger movements.\""}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/29/us/elijah-mcclain-death-ketamine/index.html", "headline": "Colorado health officials investigate ketamine use in police-custody death of Elijah McClain", "published_date": "2020-07-29", "text": "(CNN)Colorado's health department has launched an investigation into the use of ketamine in connection with the 2019 death of Elijah McClain in police custody.\nThe 23-year-old Black man died after paramedics administered the powerful anesthetic during a confrontation with police.\nThe Department of Public Health and Environment, which certifies emergency medical responders, said in a statement Wednesday that it's investigating \"numerous complaints\" that provided new information \"regarding a ketamine administration in August 2019.\"\nKetamine has been used illegally as the club drug Special K.

But 155 years after the news of their emancipation finally reached slaves in Galveston, Texas, the nation is still struggling with the issues of systemic racism and injustice.\nThat struggle surfaced once again in the national debate and massive Black Lives Matter protests that were sparked by the killing of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police officers on May 25.\nForty-seven states and the District of Columbia mark June 19 as a state holiday or observance. Communities across the country celebrate it with food and festivities. But -- despite a push by activists over the years -- Juneteenth still isn't a federal holiday. And, throughout its history, it has often been overlooked by non-black Americans.\nHere's what to know about Juneteenth.\nWhat Juneteenth is\nJuneteenth -- a blending of the words June and nineteenth -- is the oldest regular US celebration of the end of slavery.\nIt commemorates June 19, 1865: the day that Union Army Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger rode into Galveston, Texas, and told slaves of their emancipation.\nJuneteenth: 8 places to honor the end of slavery\n\"In accordance with a proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free,\" Granger read to a crowd.\nThat day came more than two years after President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863. Even after Lincoln declared all enslaved people free on paper, that hadn't necessarily been the case in practice.\nAfrican Americans and others mark Juneteenth -- also called Emancipation Day -- much like the Fourth of July, with parties, picnics and gatherings with family and friends.\nJuneteenth has been celebrated informally since 1865, but Texas became the first state to make it a state holiday in 1980.\nWhy people are talking about it now\nFor one thing, it's right around the corner.\nAnd on Thursday, President Donald Trump announced that he would hold a June 19 campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma -- the site of one of the worst acts of racist violence the country has ever seen.\n99 years ago today, America was shaken by one of its deadliest acts of racial violence\nIn 1921, tensions between Tulsa's black and white communities culminated in a white mob attacking black residents and burning black-owned businesses in a part of the city known as \"Black Wall Street.\"\nTrump's decision to hold the rally there on a day that commemorates the end of slavery was striking, given events in the aftermath of Floyd's killing. The President has remained mostly silent on issues of systemic racism and has resisted some of the changes proposed by protesters.\nDemocratic lawmakers and progressives sharply criticized the move.\n\"This isn't just a wink to white supremacists -- he's throwing them a welcome home party,\" Sen. Kamala Harris tweeted.\nWhite House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany was asked on Thursday what Juneteenth meant to the President.\n\"The African American community is very near and dear to his heart. At these rallies he often shares the great work he has done for minority communities,\" she said, citing criminal justice reform and funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities.\n\"He's working on rectifying injustices ... So it's a meaningful day to him and it's a day where he wants to share some of the progress that's been made as we look forward and more that needs to be done,\" said McEnany.\nCNN's Doug Criss, Ryan Nobles and Veronica Stracqualursi contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/03/us/drew-brees-nfl-disrespect-flag-trnd/index.html", "headline": "Drew Brees catches heat from Malcolm Jenkins and other star athletes for 'disrespecting the flag' remark", "published_date": "2020-06-03", "text": "(CNN)Drew Brees, the popular New Orleans Saints quarterback, caught heat from the likes of LeBron James and his own teammates, after saying he will \"never agree with anybody disrespecting the flag,\" a reference to players taking a knee in protest during NFL games.\nHis response came Wednesday in an interview with Yahoo Finance, when asked his opinion about players kneeling to protest police brutality once the NFL season begins this fall.\nBrees said respecting the National Anthem is not just about showing respect to the military, but also to anyone who sacrificed for this country, including those in the civil rights movement.\n\"And is everything right with our country right now? No, it's not,\" Brees said in the interview. \"We still have a long way to go. But I think what you do by standing there and showing respect to the flag with your hand over your heart, is it shows unity. It shows that we are all in this together, we can all do better, and that we are all part of the solution.\"\nShortly after the interview was posted, NBA superstar LeBron James called out the quarterback.\n\"You literally still don't understand why Kap was kneeling on one knee??\" James said in a tweet, referencing Colin Kaepernick. \"Has absolute nothing to do with the disrespect of (the flag of United States) and our soldiers.\"\nJames went on to discuss his own father-in-law who was in the Army, saying that he never found Kaepernick -- who famously knelt during the national anthem to protest police brutality -- disrespectful, \"because he and I both know what's right is right and what's wrong is wrong!\"\nMichael Thomas, a wide receiver on the Saints, didn't call out Brees specifically -- but he did retweet a comment from a journalist, reading \"How can anyone watch George Floyd get murdered and their first response when asked about it is ResPEcC tHe fLAg.\" Thomas added a puking emoji.\nMalcolm Jenkins, a safety for the Saints, had stronger words. In a tear-filled four-minute video posted to Instagram, Jenkins expressed his hurt and disappointment in Brees, saying that he is part of the problem.\n\"When I step off the field and I take my helmet off, I'm a black man walking around in America and I'm telling you I'm dealing with these things, I'm telling you my communities are dealing with these things, and your response to me is don't talk about that here ... where is the place, Drew?\"\n\"When the world tells you that you're not worthy, that your life doesn't matter, the last place you want to hear it from are the guys that you go to war with and the guys you consider to be your allies and your friends,\" Jenkins said. \"Even though we're teammates, I cant let this slide.\"\nGreen Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers also spoke up -- though he didn't reference Brees or his comments specifically.\n\"A few years ago we were criticized for locking arms in solidarity before the game,\" Rodgers said in an Instagram post. \"It has NEVER been about an anthem or a flag. Not then. Not now. Listen with an open heart, let's educate ourselves, and then turn word and thought into action.\"\nBlack players make up about 70% of the NFL. In 2018, the NFL passed a policy to fine players for kneeling during the anthem, which was done to protest police brutality and racial injustice in the US. The punishment associated with the policy was later nixed, though the policy itself still remained."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/09/us/bubba-wallace-confederate-flag-trnd/index.html", "headline": "NASCAR's Bubba Wallace will have Black Lives Matter paint scheme on car at Martinsville Speedway race", "published_date": "2020-06-09", "text": "(CNN)In a week where Bubba Wallace wore an \"I Can't Breathe\" T-shirt before an event and said racetracks shouldn't allow Confederate flags, the NASCAR driver will make another bold move Wednesday by racing a car with a Black Lives Matter paint scheme.\n\"I think by running this branding on our car, putting the hashtag out there, bringing more awareness to it, it lines up with the videos that we had put out as NASCAR,\" Wallace, the first full-time African American driver in the Cup Series since 1971, said. \"Listening and learning.

He was working hard to become the best provider, caretaker, community builder, father, husband, son, brother and relationship agent he could possibly be,\" she said. \"The justice system and systemic racism that exists made it fairly impossible for him to try to live a prosperous life well after he had paid his debt.\"\nIn one instance, a coworker's car broke down and Brooks got off his bike and walked alongside the coworker for two hours.\n\"That's the type of man Ray was. He looked out for everyone,\" she said.\nThe funeral comes more than a week after the 27-year-old father was shot and killed by an Atlanta police officer after he fought with police and tried to flee during an attempted drunken driving arrest. The shooting, amid nationwide protests against systemic racism and police brutality, has led to the resignation of the police chief and criminal charges against the officer who killed him and another officer on scene.\nKing's daughter, the Rev. Bernice A. King, said that one of the things that touched her during the service was the power of love, and how we need love in this time.\n\"We are wrestling with a past of violence, we were founded in violence,\" she told CNN after the funeral.\n\"We are in a moment, a reckoning on whether we are going to disassociate ourselves from that kind of past and create what my father called the beloved community, where you recognize the humanity of people and you respect the dignity and worth of an individual and you ensure that there is equity and justice for all people.\"\nPallbearers bring Rayshard Brooks to the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta for his funeral on Monday.\nThe Rev. Raphael G. Warnock, the senior pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church and a Democratic candidate for US Senate, noted Brooks was killed while running away and George Floyd was killed by police while complying.\n\"If your skin is the weapon and your complexion is the crime, what do you do to stay alive? Comply like George Floyd? Or run like Rayshard Brooks? I'm not asking for a friend, I'm asking for myself and my nieces and my nephews and my children,\" he said.\n\"This country has become too accustomed and comfortable with black people dying.

This happened in the city whose grounds are known for America and the world warrior of peace, my daddy, Martin Luther King, Jr., who taught us that true peace is not merely the absence of tension but it is the presence of justice. Therefore, there can be no peace in Atlanta nor anywhere in our nation where there is no justice.\"\nKing then raised her fist in the air while saying, \"No justice, no peace.\"\nAtlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and Stacey Abrams, the former top Democrat in the Georgia House, were also in attendance, and gospel singers Smokie Norful, Tamela Mann and Kurt Carr performed at the service.\nMedia mogul Tyler Perry has offered to pay for the funeral arrangements, according to Brooks' family attorney Chris Stewart and a news release.\nStruggle to overcome imprisonment and probation\nBrooks leaves behind his widow, Tomika Miller, three young daughters and a 13-year-old stepson.\nIn an interview in February with Reconnect, a company that focuses on fighting incarceration, Brooks spoke openly about his time spent in prison and his struggle to care for his family while on probation.\n\"I just feel like some of the system could, you know, look at us as individuals,\" he said. \"We do have lives, you know, was just a mistake we made, you know, and, you know, not, not just do us, as if we are animals. You know, lock us away.\"\nRayshard Brooks opened up about the struggles of life after incarceration in an interview before his death\nBrooks told the interviewer he was arrested for false imprisonment and financial credit card fraud. He said his public defender told him he could get 10 years, so he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to a year in prison.\n\"I'm like, 'oh my God, I have kids out here' ... so I'm trying to do the best option I can to be back to society,\" he said.\nNationwide, 4.5 million people are on probation or parole, and African-Americans make up 30 percent of those on community supervision.\nAs part of a plea deal, Brooks pleaded guilty in 2014 to charges of false imprisonment, simple battery/family, simple battery and felony cruelty/cruelty to children, and he was sentenced to one year in prison and six years on probation, according to court records. Two years later, he was sent back to prison for 12 months for violating his probation.\nThe Rev. Warnock said that the video of Brooks' comments was heartbreaking.\n\"He talks about how hard it is to come back, to recover when you return. He was trying. He had been digging his way back. And he knew that night that he could very well lose his liberty,\" Warnock said. \"Afraid of losing his liberty, he lost his life, running from a system that too often makes slaves out of people.\n\"This is much bigger than the police. This is about a whole system that cries out for renewal and reform.\"\nOther speakers spoke about his personality and love of music and dancing. Rochelle Gooden, his mother-in-law, said Brooks had a wide smile and fondly recalled his love for old-school music like Al Green.\nHis cousin, Jymaco Brooks, said Rayshard Brooks was the type of person who would always make you laugh.\n\"All he wanted to do was smile, crack jokes, dance a little bit and live,\" he said.\nThe fatal shooting\nBodycam video shows moments leading up to fatal shooting 02:48\nBrooks died after he was shot in the back on June 12 by Atlanta police officer Garrett Rolfe.\nThe incident began when officer Devin Brosnan responded to a Wendy's restaurant to find Brooks asleep in his car in the drive-through lane.\nAtlanta is once again at the center of the nation's struggle with race and civil rights\nAfter a calm, lengthy interaction, Brooks failed a sobriety test, and when police moved to handcuff him, he resisted and tried to fight off the officers. During the fight, Brooks took one of the officers' Tasers, according to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.\nVideo of the incident shows him running away, and he appears to turn and point the Taser in the direction of one of the officers. The officer, Rolfe, then fired his handgun three times, striking Brooks twice in the back and also hitting a nearby occupied vehicle.\nRolfe was fired and Brosnan was placed on administrative duty\nFulton County District Attorney Paul Howard charged Rolfe with felony murder and 10 other accounts and charged Brosnan with aggravated assault for allegedly standing on Brooks' shoulders as he lay dying.\nRolfe's attorneys said that he fired the fatal shots \"fearing for his safety and the safety of the civilians around him.\" Brosnan said that he suffered a concussion during the fight and that he stepped on Brooks for a short period of time in the immediate, disorienting aftermath of the shooting.\nCNN's Lindsay Benson, Chuck Johnston, Randi Kaye, Pamela Kirkland, Jamiel Lynch, Laura Robinson, Devon Sayers and Nick Valencia contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/14/us/atlanta-protests-rayshard-brooks-sunday/index.html", "headline": "Autopsy report says Rayshard Brooks was shot twice in the back, lists manner of death as homicide", "published_date": "2020-06-14", "text": "Atlanta (CNN)Rayshard Brooks was shot twice in the back, according to a release by the Fulton County, Georgia, Medical Examiner's Office.\nBrooks died from organ damage and blood loss from the two gunshot wounds, according to the office.\nThe autopsy, performed on Sunday, lists Brooks' cause of death as gunshot wounds to the back.

The videos show that Brooks took an officer's Taser during the attempted arrest and then fired the Taser at the officers as he ran away.\nOne officer then fatally shot Brooks three times with his service weapon, authorities said.\nThe killing has had rapid repercussions in Atlanta, one of many cities where protesters have called for an end to police violence and racism in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Or the alternative is whether or not he fired the shot simply to capture him or some other reason,\" Howard said. \"If that shot was fired for some reason other than to save that officer's life or to prevent injury to him or others, then that shooting is not justified under the law.\"\nAn attorney for Brooks' family, L.

He would be doing a life sentence.

Footage from both officers' body cameras and from their vehicles shows them speaking with Brooks for nearly 30 minutes outside the Wendy's.\nBrooks says he does not have any weapons on him and the officers pat him down to confirm as much, the videos show. Howard said their interaction was \"cordial\" and noted that Brooks answered the officers' questions.\nRayshard Brooks was killed a day before he planned to celebrate his daughter's birthday\nAfter Brooks takes a breathalyzer test, one officer tells him to put his hands behind his back and they move to handcuff him, the videos show.\nBrooks then resists the arrest and begins struggling with the officers as they tussle on the ground for about 30 seconds, according to videos from the scene.\n\"Stop fighting! Stop fighting!\" an officer says, according to audio from the body camera.\nDuring the struggle, Brooks grabs an officer's Taser, escapes their grasp and starts running away from the two, the videos show.\n\"He's got my f---ing Taser,\" an officer says, according to the body camera footage.\nAtlanta officer Garrett Rolfe, left, and officer Devin Brosnan.\nSurveillance video provided by the GBI shows Brooks running from the officers, and he appears to point the stun gun in their direction before falling to the ground.

An officer was treated for an injury and released.\nThe GBI kicked off an investigation into the incident at the request of the Atlanta Police Department, officials said Saturday. Once that investigation is completed, the case will be turned over to prosecutors.\nHoward said Brooks' autopsy was performed on Sunday, and investigators are still working to speak with other witnesses and obtain a preliminary report from the Medical Examiner before coming to a decision. In addition, Howard said his office is \"still experiencing some difficulty\" getting all of the body-camera and dashcam footage from Atlanta Police.\nWendy's set ablaze\nA person holds a sign as a Wendy's restaurant burns Saturday in Atlanta\nThe shooting reignited the anger and frustration undergirding the mass protests over the past few weeks. The Wendy's where the shooting took place was set aflame on Saturday night, and in another part of the city, a major interstate was shut down after protesters marched onto a connector and were met by lined up police vehicles.\n\"I just want to make enough noise that they investigate the situation,\" one protester told WSB. A large crowd remained on the streets of southwest Atlanta into early Sunday morning, the news station said, facing off with police.\nAt least 36 people were arrested during the protests, an Atlanta police spokesman told CNN.\n\"I was very disturbed with what happened,\" protester Marquavian Odom told CNN. \"This is something that keeps happening over and over again.

Just nine out of 100 White people were pulled over in the city, according to the project.\nBut bias becomes more obvious after the stop, researchers said.

Here's why", "published_date": "2020-06-08", "text": "(CNN)The use of tear gas to disperse crowds has come under criticism again as demonstrators nationwide continue protesting systematic racism and police brutality following the death of George Floyd.\nTop health experts have warned that using the chemical agent could help the coronavirus spread because it irritates the lungs and makes people cough. And organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union have pointed out that the chemical agent is banned in war.\nIf tear gas is banned on the battlefield, why then can law enforcement use tear gas on civilians at home? Here's what to know.\nWhat tear gas is\nFirst off, it's important to understand what exactly tear gas is.\nTear gas, also referred to as a riot control agent, is a chemical compound that can render people temporarily unable to function by irritating the eyes, nose, mouth, lungs and skin, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThe two most common riot control agents are chloroacetophenone (CN) and chlorobenzylidenemalononitrile (CS), the CDC says.\nTear gas: Prepare for what to do if you're exposed\nDespite its name, tear gas actually comes in a powdery solid form. The agents CN and CS are deployed as tear gas when the pressurized powder is mixed into a liquid formulation that is then released into the air as droplets or particles.\nTear gas can cause excessive tearing, burning or blurred vision, as well as a runny nose or a burning sensation inside the nose, according to the CDC. It can also cause difficulty swallowing, chest tightness, coughing, shortness of breath and a feeling of choking.\nSomeone who has been exposed to tear gas will usually experience its effects for about 15 to 30 minutes after they have been removed from the source and cleaned off, the CDC says. Those who are exposed to riot control agents at close proximity or in a closed space can experience long-term effects, such as blindness, glaucoma or respiratory failure.\nHow its use is legal\nA few years after the end of World War I, world leaders convened in Switzerland and agreed to prohibit \"the use in war of asphyxiating, poisonous or other gases, and of all analogous liquids, materials or devices\" as well as \"the use of bacteriological methods of warfare,\" according to the Geneva Protocol of 1925.\nThe agreement banned the use of chemical and biological weapons in warfare, though it did not specify what gases exactly were outlawed.\nThe US didn't ratify the agreement until 1975, under President Gerald Ford. When it did, it reserved the right to use riot control agents to control \"rioting prisoners of war,\" among other exceptions.\nPortland is the latest city to suspend the use of tear gas on protesters\nIn 1993, the United Nations General Assembly finalized the Chemical Weapons Convention, which banned the development, production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons and required countries to destroy the chemical weapons and production facilities it possessed.\nIncluded in the agreement was also a ban on riot control agents in warfare. Such agents were defined as \"any chemical not listed in a Schedule, which can produce rapidly in humans sensory irritation or disabling physical effects which disappear within a short time following termination of exposure.\"\nThe Chemical Weapons Convention went into effect in 1997. But notably, the agreement included an exception allowing law enforcement to use riot control agents for \"domestic riot control purposes.\"\nIn recent years, tear gas has been used to quell civil unrest, not just in US cities, but in Hong Kong, Cairo and Rio de Janeiro.\nPortland, Denver and Seattle are among cities that have suspended the use of tear gas to disperse crowds, at least temporarily.\nCNN's Ryan Prior contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/20/us/portland-protests-fifty-days/index.html", "headline": "Protests in Portland have carried on for more than 50 days.

While many have been peaceful, those demonstrations have also been marked by violence, vandalism, arson, arrests and allegations of police brutality.\nLast week, the state's US Attorney called for an investigation into why some protesters were being taken by federal agents without badges and put into unmarked vehicles.\nOver the weekend, protesters pulled down barricades, moved them into streets, and attempted to light a building on fire. Sunday's demonstrations ended with protesters being dispersed with gas by federal law enforcement, the Portland Police said in a tweet.\nWhile the protests are now getting national attention, allegations of racism and calls for reform have long been a part of the city.\nWhy did the protests start?\nThe death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police officers in May was the spark that lit demonstrations nationwide, with tens of thousands demanding police reform, accountability and, above all, re-establishing that Black Lives Matter.\nIn Portland, like so many cities across the country, demonstrations are calling for justice in the deaths of Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Elijah McClain and countless other Black lives that have ended in violence.\nA Navy veteran says he was beaten and pepper sprayed by authorities while attending his first protest in Portland\nBut what began as a call for justice and accountability has given way to a melting pot of demonstrations.\nProtests have ranged from peaceful Black Lives Matter marches during the day to unidentified protesters taking part in violent demonstrations that devolve into arson and vandalism. President Trump and other federal officials have characterized some of these events as the actions of \"anarchists and agitators.\"\nNow weeks have gone by with officers and protesters clashing, resulting in injuries on both sides, vandalism, arson, and allegations of brutality.\nIn the last week alone, at least 40 protesters were arrested on charges varying from resisting arrest to disorderly conduct, according press releases from the PPB.\nA history of racism\nPortland has long been a place where tensions between opposing demonstrators have been a source for conflict.\nIn recent years, some protests have become a target for hate groups seeking to antagonize other people who come out to defend the rights of marginalized communities such as immigrants, people of color and members of the LGBTQ community.\n\"History will tell you that it's a racist city, which it is and has been,\" said Sam Sachs, a community member who spoke during a press conference held by the Portland Police Association Sunday. \"Oregon was created as White utopia.\"\nOregon's complicated racial tensions start in the 1800's, with laws put in place to keep people of color out of the state. The 14th Amendment was not passed there until 1868, which given citizenship to Black people.\nIn the early 1900's, the city's Board of Realty passed a \"code of ethics,\" which prohibited realtors from selling homes in White neighborhoods to Black people.\nDemonstrations have been filling the streets nightly.\nThis hasn't been lost on the community. Sachs, whose family has been in the area since the 1940's, founded the No Hate Zone, -- an organization which is focused on ending hate and racism through education, engagement and advocacy.\nWhile he said that right now Portland is known as a \"hotbed for violence,\" it is also \"a city of opportunity.\"\n\"(It's) a city of love. A city of growth. A city that cares about its police. A city that cares about its Black and indigenous community members, gay, lesbian, transgender, cares about everyone. Portland is a city of love and hope.\"\nMany other community members who spoke echoed his sentiments and decried the violence that has come with the calls for justice.\nPastor J.W. Matt Hennessee, who was also present during the press conference, said while he understands that citizens are tired of the brutality they see at the hands of police, he's tired of the violence, division and continued racism he and his community have faced.\n\"You want to know what tired looks like, ask us what tired looks like. Because we are the ones who couldn't purchase a house or rent a place anywhere near a certain place because nobody wanted people like us to be in it. We couldn't go to this school or that school or we couldn't do a number of different,\" the pastor said.\n\"It's very important that we come together, and I'm not as concerned about what we are tired of, I'm very concerned about the world that we can make together.\"\nFight over federal agents arresting protesters\nAs protests have ramped up over the last few weeks, the Trump administration has sent in federal agents from the Department of Homeland Security to respond to the city.\nUS Customs and Border Protection (CBP) admitted to being one of the agencies involved in arresting protesters and said in a statement that they were called in because \"violent anarchists have organized events in Portland over the last several weeks with willful intent to damage and destroy federal property, as well as, injure federal officers and agents.\"\nFederal law enforcement officers have been deployed under the Trump administration's new executive order to protect federal monuments and buildings.\n\"These criminal actions will not be tolerated,\" the statement said.\nThey have not been well received, with the mayor, governor and several other state and local officials calling for the federal involvement to end, saying it's only throwing gas on the flames.\n\"People are being literally scooped off the street into unmarked vans, rental cars,\" Mayor Ted Wheeler told CNN on Sunday. \"Apparently, they are being denied probable cause, and they're denied due process. They don't even know who's pulling them into the vans.\"\nThere are \"dozens if not hundreds of federal troops descending upon our city, and what they're doing is they are sharply escalating the situation,\" the mayor added. \"Their presence here is actually leading to more violence and more vandalism.\"\nAfter people were seen being taken by federal officers without badges and put into unmarked vans, US Attorney Billy J.

Here is why", "published_date": "2020-06-28", "text": "(CNN)Soon after George Floyd died at the hands of police in Minneapolis, the city's public school district voted to push police out of its schools.\nThe move has inspired many other districts across the US to make a similar decision -- or at least consider it.\n5 students tell you why they want police-free schools\nSchool officials in Denver, Milwaukee and Portland, Oregon, have all announced they are severing ties with police.\nAnd in California, the state's Department of Education is pushing for a reevaluation of police on school campuses, specifically as it relates to racial justice, Superintendent Tony Thurmond said last week. Hours later, the school board in Oakland, California, unanimously voted to disband the school district's police department as part of what they called the George Floyd Resolution.\nSchool resource officers have been a common fixture in American public schools for decades. They are meant to keep campuses safe, and even mentor students. But activists say these officers have been criminalizing Black and Latino students.\nFloyd's death ignited calls to defund and abolish police departments and is revitalizing the movement against school policing. Here's why many advocates say police brutality doesn't just happen in the streets -- and why they believe removing officers from schools is critical to racial equality.\nWhy are cops in schools?\nSchool resource officers, or SROs, have been part of K-12 public schools in America since the 1950s, according to the US Department of Justice.\nThe day's biggest stories in 10 minutes or less.\nSign up and get access to videos and weekly student quizzes.\nSign Me Up\nNo, Thanks\nBy subscribing you agree to our\nprivacy policy.\nSRO programs were initially a way to build relationships between police and young people in some cities, but the practice spread widely and with a greater emphasis in security following the 1999 Columbine shooting.\nThese officers have the same training, the same capabilities and the same resources as other members of the police or sheriff's department -- but their roles are more multifaceted. They settle disputes, monitor bus traffic and simply provide security, all while serving as counselors, mentors and sometimes teachers.\nDenver's school board votes to end its relationship with the city's police department\nBut some SROs have been accused of using excessive force toward students and contributing to the school-to-prison pipeline, according to an ACLU report published in 2017.\nWhile there's not an official nationwide database of SROs, the National Center for Education Statistics estimates there were at least 52,100 officers working in US public schools in 2016. That includes full-time and part-time officers.\nThe Department of Justice has granted millions of dollars to fund SROs for decades through different initiatives, but there's no national standard training requirements for officers deployed in schools.\nOnly 24 states and the District of Columbia have passed laws addressing SRO training and those statues are not uniform, according to a report by Strategies for Youth, a non-profit aiming to improve interactions between police and young people.\nViolent confrontations can scar students\nMany confrontations between police officers and students in schools have become violent, mirroring some interactions between law enforcement and people on city streets.\nLast year, officers in North Carolina were accused of body slamming boys and girls, holding them in a chokehold, and officers in Orlando, Florida, arrested 6-year-old girls for reportedly having a tantrum.\nThose interactions have scarred students like Amir Lumumba, 12, who watched a SRO at his elementary school in Dayton, Ohio, place one of his classmates in handcuffs after a fight broke out.\nBody camera videos show 6-year-old sobbing and pleading with officers during arrest\n\"I was in disbelief,\" Amir told CNN. \"There's more than one way to get a kid out of a classroom. You don't have to put them on the ground, handcuff them to get them to go to the office.\"\nAmir, who is now an 8th grader in Montgomery County, Maryland, has been advocating for months against expanding the Montgomery Public Schools' SRO program to middle schools.\nStudents of color and those with disabilities are often disproportionately punished, advocates and students say.\nDuring the 2015-2016 school year, over 290,600 students were referred to law enforcement agencies or arrested, according to the US Department of Education Office for Civil Rights.\nBlack students represented 15% of the student body, and 31% of the referral or arrests. Sixty-five percent of the arrests were students of color or mixed races.\nStudents and community members gathered outside the Los Angeles Unified School District urging officials to defund its school police.\n\"I don't think SROs should be in school because I feel like young black boys, like myself, we are more often targeted than other people,\" Amir said.\nWhat would police-free schools look like?\nIt's unclear how schools districts would redirect the funding previously allocated for on-campus sworn officers.\nSome advocates, like Keri Smith, deputy director for Padres & J\u00f3venes Unidos in Denver, are concerned those funds will be used to reinforce other infrastructures or systems that still criminalize the youth.\nWhat the US would look like without police, as imagined in 3 scenarios\n\"We want police out of schools and not just bodies,\" Smith said. \"We don't want to take police out and add more cameras and more metal detectors.\"\nInstead, school officials should look into funding art and music programs and increasing the number of counselors, Smith said.\nIn American public schools, the average ratio is 430 students per counselor, according to the American School Counselor Association. The ASCA recommends an average ratio of 250 students.\nJasmin Benas, 18, started a petition calling for the removal of SROs from Wake County Public Schools, the largest school district in North Carolina. She believes the money can and should be allocated elsewhere.\n\"It's extremely unnecessary and a bad allocation of money (SRO program) considering the fact that we only have one social workers in a school with 2,000 students or we have one nurse, one day a week for 2,000 students,\" Benas told CNN.\nBenas said after Floyd's death and clashes between police and protesters in Raleigh, she and her classmates began questioning the ways they have been traditionally disciplined and how school resources are being distributed.\nThe petition has now amassed more than 4,000 signatures.\nSome say SROs are still the best community-based policing\nFor Mo Canady, the executive director of the National Association School Resource Officers, it's disappointing to see communities moving to remove SROs from schools without first considering more additional training or other changes to the way the officers operate.\n\"If school districts have good, sound SRO programs, then they are eliminating what could be the best community based policing program any community could have,\" Canady told CNN.\nSROs play a role in preventing school shootings, and have stopped them in the past. But they also serve as a deterrent to other types of crime, he said.\nA school resource officer is keeping up his tradition of congratulating graduates by going to all 317 seniors' houses\n\"There are going to be assaults, there are going to be drug issues on campus, there are going to be trespassers,\" Canady said. \"There are are going to be dangers that come from the outside in that are not just in the active shooter category.\"\nSome school officials agree that SROs can have a positive impact on campuses.\n\"We've seen less violence, less suspensions.

Shea said that the city may not need 1 million or 10,000 people in jail, but \"these goddamn 20 people need to go jail.\"\nThe speech mirrored what a number NYPD officials have espoused since the height of the George Floyd demonstrations in New York City: Police officers are now confronted with anti-police rhetoric that has gained support from city lawmakers and that has emboldened some to commit crimes, contributing in part to the spike in violence.\n\"You are going to be incredibly tested -- incredibly tested, probably in the months to come this is not a short term problem. They have screwed this city up so much in a short period of time, it's going to take us a time to get it -- our arms around it,\" Shea said. \"It's already started I believe. Cops are incredibly challenged in how they can police today. There's no question.\"\nNYPD sees 'troubling' surge of retirement filings, official says\nThe speech comes after de Blasio's recent signing of a package of police reform bills, which include a law that bans the use of a chokehold, but also police officers sitting on someone's back or using a knee during an arrest.\nNYPD officials say the new laws have made officers more hesitant to make arrests because it takes away a key crime tool in subduing a suspect during a tense arrest. Officials have said the changes contribute to not only the rise in violence, but low morale.\n\"I don't know that there's ever been a period exactly like this where so many systems of government are literally cowards that won't stand up for what's right,\" Shea said. \"They're failing at every possible measure to be leaders.

The cemetery was closed to the public during the excavation, and forensic archaeologists were on hand to search for clues.\nIn a news conference Wednesday, State Archeologist Kary Stacklebeck described the test excavation as an \"intermediate phase\" meant to confirm whether there was a mass grave present before recommending a more complicated, full-scale recovery effort.\nWhile no mass graves were discovered, the effort uncovered some artifacts dating to the 1920s, the news release said, most notably a bullet, two pairs of shoes and a buried road.\n\"At this point, we believe we have fully investigated this anomaly, and unfortunately we have not discovered the evidence of Race Massacre victims we were hoping to find,\" Stacklebeck said in the city's news release. \"But we have learned a great deal about the cemetery itself, and this is information we can carry forward as we investigate future sites.\"\nThe city said there were still multiples sites of interest and potential candidates for mass graves.\nAs many as 300 people were killed in the massacre\nFor decades, the massacre -- often referred to as the Tulsa race riots -- were largely unacknowledged.\nThe massacre has gotten more attention in recent years, particularly on its 99th anniversary last month, which occurred amid nationwide protests over racial injustice following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.\nAccording to historic accounts, the riots were sparked by a confrontation between a Black resident and a White man among a group of angry White people demanding the lynching of a young Black man.

But in other developed countries, such incidents are rare.\nStatistical comparisons show that police in the US typically shoot, arrest and imprison more people than similarly developed nations.\nEach nation listed below either accompanies the US in the G7 group of the world's most advanced economies, or is ranked similarly on global wealth, freedom and democracy indexes. But when it comes to policing and criminal justice, the US is a noticeable outlier, and black Americans are disproportionately affected.\nData on arrests, deaths and prison populations do not exist uniformly across developed countries, so it can be difficult to pinpoint exactly how the US fares in comparison to every nation. For instance, it is impossible to know exactly how many people die at the hands of police officers in the US each year: no single, nationwide database that contains such information exists.\n\"We can't have an informed discussion, because we don't have data,\" former FBI Director James Comey told the House Judiciary Committee in 2015. \"People have data about who went to a movie last weekend ... and I cannot tell you how many people were shot by police in the United States last month, last year, or anything about the demographics. And that's a very bad place to be.\"\nWe are therefore forced to rely on estimates -- but even they paint a stark picture.\nA media review by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) found a total of 1,348 potential arrest-related deaths in the ten months from June 2015 through March 2016 -- an average of 135 deaths per month, or just over 4 per day. (The review excludes deaths under the jurisdiction of federal and tribal law enforcement, and the BJS acknowledged it does not provide a complete picture.)\nBy comparison, only 13 people in the UK died in or following police custody in the closest time period, according to the country's police watchdog. In Australia, 21 deaths occurred in police custody or custody-related operations in 2015/16. Those measures are the most accurate comparison to the US's figure of arrest-related deaths, according to the UK Home Office. The UK's figure does not include every death that occurred following police contact.\nAmerican police also shoot more people than forces in similarly developed countries.\nThe FBI recorded that 407 people were shot in an act of \"justifiable homicide\" by a police officer in 2018, a decline on previous years. But homicides ruled justifiable do not capture every police killing, and the FBI's numbers are derided by many human rights groups and news organizations which have collected far higher figures. The Washington Post counted 1,004 people fatally shot by police in 2019, for instance, while the group Mapping Police Violence tallied 1,099.\nComey's comments to the House Judiciary Committee illustrate the FBI's own acceptance that their number does not tell the full story. Nonetheless, even the FBI's figure dramatically dwarfs that of many other countries, where police shootings are highly isolated incidents.

If every US state were counted as a country, the 31 countries with the highest incarceration rates in the world would all be US states, according to the Prison Policy Initiative.

Paxson said the university would reverse the decision for the school's track, field and cross country teams after the Brown community expressed serious concerns about the rank change's \"implications to build and sustain diverse and inclusive communities for students at Brown, and particularly for black students and alumni.\"\nThese are the schools reporting coronavirus cases within their athletic programs\nWhile Ingram is pleased with the reversal, he told CNN, he's frustrated that it happened in the first place.\n\"Our students, alumni and parents took the time to share their deeply personal stories of the transformative impact that participation in track, field and cross country has had on their lives,\" Paxson wrote Wednesday in a letter to the Brown community. \"Many noted that, through Brown's history, these sports have been a point of entry to higher education for academically talented students who otherwise would not have had the opportunity, many of them students of color.\"\nSports are an entryway to the Ivy League\nFormer Princeton track athlete Russell Dinkins joined in the fight to get Brown to reverse its decision because he saw himself in those athletes.\n\"Sports is the greatest entryway to the Ivy League,\" he said. \"It provides the biggest admissions advantage, more than legacy admissions.\"\nSenate passes bill to permanently fund historically black colleges and universities\nVarsity teams are allotted a certain amount of spots for recruiting purposes, according to Dinkins, whereas club sports don't have recruited spots. And while Brown, as a member of the Ivy League, doesn't award academic or athletic scholarships, varsity athletic coaches are able to recommend to admissions officers students they think will be a welcome addition to campus, according to the school's website.\nBrown's decision to drop track, field and cross country from its varsity ranks could have had life altering consequences, Dinkins said.\nHe took issue with Brown's initial decision to close off access for deserving students because had it not been for track he too would have missed out on an Ivy League education at Princeton.\nEven though Dinkins is a Princeton alum, he said it's not about where he went to school. He wanted to help fight for one of the few access points available for students coming from diverse backgrounds and disadvantaged socioeconomic statuses.\nA decision two years in the making\nIn Paxson's initial letter to students in May, she said the school conducted an internal review during the 2018-19 academic year and consultants concluded there were too many varsity sports at Brown which \"was a barrier to competitiveness.\"\n\"In the decade ending in 2018, Brown earned 2.8% of Ivy titles, the lowest in the Ivy League,\" Paxson said. \"This outcome is inconsistent with the Ivy League principle of competitive balance across schools, and with Brown's commitment to excellence in all we do.\"\nIn January she asked a committee of alumni with \"deep ties to Brown athletics\" to come up with ways to improve the student athletics program.\nSome colleges and universities plan to have limited in-person classes and cancel fall break to combat coronavirus\nThe committee recommended the following changes: revise rosters by reducing the amount of varsity sports teams from 38 to 29, and \"continue to focus on admission and recruitment of outstanding student-athletes, as well maintaining roster sizes that build competitiveness, enhance our focus on coaching, training and conditioning, including professional development for athletics staff, and advance facilities improvements that will make a difference in recruiting talented coaches and student-athletes, and improve competitiveness in varsity athletics.\"\nThe 11 teams affected in the initial advisory were men and women's fencing, men and women's golf, women's skiing, men and women's squash, women's equestrian and men's track, field and cross country, which are considered three individual varsity sports under federal Title IX rules.\nIn light of the reversal of track, field and cross country, eight of the other teams will maintain their new club status and Brown's varsity program will now include a total of 32 teams, according to the online statement.\nAdditionally, club coed sailing and club women's sailing will transition to varsity status, the school said.\nAlumni and student athletes mobilize for change\nWithin two hours of the announcement from Brown in May, Ingram said alumni quickly mobilized on Facebook. The group consisted of former Brown student athletes, current Brown student athletes, former Brown coaches, parents, and former Olympians -- anyone who shared a common goal of wanting Brown to reverse its decision, according to Ingram. That's when Dinkins got involved.\nWhite people are already experts on racism\nIn response to Brown's decision, athletes from the sports teams who were stripped of their rank coordinated efforts and created six online petitions championing for their sport to hold onto its classification, according to the student publication at Brown, The Brown Daily Herald.\nAdditionally, captains from each of the demoted teams authored an open letter to Brown administrators, The Herald said.\nBrown addresses the timing of its announcement\nIn a second letter on June 6, Paxson said she was met with feedback from the community about the timing of Brown's decision to demote these varsity teams, shortly after the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who died at the hands of police while being arrested in Minneapolis.\nPaxson said there's never a right time to make a change like this without affecting some group of current student-athletes, new recruits and coaches.\n\"But I never could have imagined the release of the initiative would come on the heels of one of the most heart-wrenching moments in our nation's history \u2014 the death of George Floyd and the illumination of the longstanding problem in this country of anti-black racism \u2014 and I am truly sorry for the impact the collision of these circumstances have had on so many in our community,\" she said.\nNFL stars call on Clemson University to sever all ties with John C.

In the letter, the school said they don't condone acts of racism, discrimination or violence.\n\"This cannot be accepted as 'normal,'\" the letter said. \"We must continue to demand equity and justice for all people, inclusive of all identities. And we must continue to care for and support each other, especially in this time when we are apart.\"\nThere's more work to be done\nEven though Brown's track, field and cross country teams were reinstated, Ingram said there's a lot of advocacy work still to do.\nAfter seeing the success at Brown, student athletes of color from other Ivy League schools have reached out to Ingram for support in being a catalyst for change on issues like racially tone deaf staff, trainers and directors and by cosigning letters to administrators for change at their own schools.\n\"We're not just going to stop making our voices heard because we got what we wanted at Brown,\" Ingram said. \"There's a lot more work that needs to be done in diversity in athletics across the board so we're going to do more work as a group to fix that.\""}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/22/us/nascar-race-bubba-wallace-talladega/index.html", "headline": "NASCAR drivers offer Bubba Wallace show of support after noose found in his garage", "published_date": "2020-06-22", "text": "(CNN)NASCAR drivers, pit crew members and others walked alongside Bubba Wallace and escorted his Number 43 car in a show of support at the Talladega Superspeedway on Monday a day after a noose was found in his garage.\nIn a video tweeted by NASCAR Executive Vice President Steve O'Donnell, Wallace's car is being followed and pushed down pit row by a large procession of people.

My goodness, there's systemic racism within pretty much everything in this country.\"\nAnd studies suggest discrepancies in how different races are treated by police:\nYou don't have to be the target of racism to be harmed by it\n-- African-Americans are at greater risk of being killed by police, even though they are less likely to pose an objective threat to law enforcement, according to research by Northeastern University Professor Matt Miller. The research found Hispanics are also more likely to be victims of police shootings.\n-- Researchers from Northeastern and Harvard University analyzed fatal shootings by police in 27 states from 2014-15. Among those who were \"unarmed and appeared to show no objective threat to police, nearly two-thirds of the victims were Hispanic or Black,\" the researchers found.\n-- When it comes to misdemeanors, \"there is profound racial disparity in the misdemeanor arrest rate for most -- but not all -- offense types,\" according to a 2018 report from researchers from George Mason University and the University of Georgia.\n-- The NAACP Legal Defense Fund analyzed complaints against police in North Charleston, South Carolina. (That's where former officer Michael Slager shot an unarmed black man, Walter Scott, five times in the back as Scott was running away from a traffic stop.) The 2017 study found that black residents were more likely to file complaints than white residents -- but \"NCPD sustained complaints filed by Black residents only 31 percent of the time compared to sustaining complaints filed by White residents 50 percent of the time,\" the study says. \"NCPD defines 'sustained' as 'the allegation is supported by sufficient evidence to justify a reasonable conclusion that the allegation is factual.\"\n-- Latino youth are 65% more likely to be detained or committed than their white peers, according to a 2017 report from The Sentencing Project.\n-- In the 2015 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, about 17 million white respondents and 4 million black respondents reported having used an illicit drug within the last month. African Americans and whites use drugs at similar rates, but the imprisonment rate of African Americans for drug charges is almost 6 times that of whites, the NAACP said.\nHow to not raise a racist white kid\n-- Researchers analyzed traffic safety stops in Kansas City and found no major racial disparities in ticketing for speeding. But they found that \"blacks were 2.7 times more likely to be pulled over in an investigatory stop,\" NPR station KCUR reported. \"Blacks were also subject to searches five times more often than white drivers.\"\n-- That same study, by three University of Kansas professors, found stark differences in how white and black drivers were treated when they were pulled over. Many white drivers who were surveyed described brief interactions with police. But black drivers who had an infraction like a burnt out light were more often \"questioned about what they were doing in a particular neighborhood, where they were heading, and whether they were carrying drugs,\" the report said. \"Many were subject to vehicle searches.\"\nTim Wise, author of the book \"White Like Me,\" took issue with O'Brien's belief that systemic racism doesn't exist in police forces.\n\"When you have the national security adviser saying he doesn't see systemic racism, well you know what? White folks also didn't see systemic racism even in the 1960s,\" Wise said.\nOfficers join protesters to denounce excessive use of force\nHe said polls prior to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 showed two-thirds of white respondents said they believed black people were already being treated fairly in America.\n\"White folks looked around and basically said 'Eh, what's the problem?'\" Wise said.\n\"If white America didn't get it even when it was obvious in retrospect to everyone, what in the world would make the national security adviser believe that he or anyone else knows what they're talking about now? I think it probably stands to reason that black and brown folks know their reality better than we do.\"\nOfficers also want to see change.

Back in 2011, James Craig Anderson was, too, when he was dragged to his death in Mississippi, just 13 years after James Byrd of Texas met his fate in the same fashion.\nDemonstrators march against police brutality on Tuesday in New York.\nThese lynchings aren't the depraved, grandiose exhibitions of the late 1800s and early 1900s, when black men were skinned or castrated and pregnant women were burned alive before throngs who took pictures and collected body parts as souvenirs.\nYet the killings continue. In 2020. More than a half century after the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Lynching or not, it has to stop, they say. Here are their thoughts:\nThe niece\nIn addition to losing her Uncle Tim in 1983, Heather Coggins lost another uncle, Eugene Coggins, who died in police custody in 2001, she said. Their deaths remind her of Arbery's and Floyd's.\nTimothy Coggins was always dancing, especially if Frankie Beverly was playing, his family says.\n\"Our family has endured both of these cases. I see Ahmaud Arbery as a modern-day lynching,\" she said. \"I can go hunt this human down because I have white privilege ... I can kill this black man, the country doesn't care about him, his life isn't worth as much as mine and we can get away with it. That's what we saw in our case.\"\nBill Moore Sr. and brother-in-law Frankie Gebhardt killed Timothy Coggins for socializing with Gebhardt's \"old lady,\" a white woman, according to testimony in Gebhardt's trial.\nIn 2018, Gebhardt was found guilty of murder and sentenced to life in prison plus 30 years. Moore pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and concealing a death, and got 20.\nThough justice arrived, the Coggins family spent 35 years wondering what happened to Timothy, said Heather Coggins, who was six years old at the time. The local paper barely covered it in 1983.\nFear and mistrust dictated many of her life decisions. She learned to \"maneuver as uneventfully as possible,\" she said, avoiding police and white communities.\nWhen she first met a CNN reporter about her uncle's case in 2017, she waited to enter a cafe because a circling truck drew her suspicions. She went inside after she was satisfied it posed no threat.\n\"Why wouldn't we fear the media or the law enforcement in terms of nobody is protecting us? Nobody wants to hear our story,\" she said.\nThe philosopher\nYancy is comfortable with the term, lynching, for hate-driven killings, he said. He doesn't appreciate being told otherwise.\n\"Whose reality is this? It's the reality of black people in America,\" he said. \"The freedom of naming our reality is a form of empowerment. Who gets to define our reality? We do.\"\nThe country is founded on white supremacy, beginning with native American genocide and black enslavement, he said. Lynchings weren't popular during slavery. Slaves were property. You didn't destroy property, the professor said.\nRodney King: The viral video that set a city on fire 03:00\nOnce slavery was abolished, whites sought to control a liberated workforce. Lynchings discouraged social mobility, served as surveillance and instilled fear, forcing blacks to \"internalize the ever-present possibility that this could happen for minor infractions,\" he said.\n\"Lynching functioned as a form of control and as a form of intimidation,\" he said.\nMost of the victims were accused, often wrongly, of major crimes such as rape or murder, leaning on tropes that blacks were hypersexual and vicious.\nCriminalizing black men and deeming them subhuman, more akin to beasts in the field than white men, served to justify the brutality they were dealt, Yancy said. Even Friedrich Nietzsche, widely admired on American campuses, wrote blacks had superior tolerances for pain.\nToday, the \"white gaze\" regards African Americans similarly, Yancy said. He likens it to Procrustes, the bandit of Greek mythology who compelled travelers to lie in his iron bed. If they were too short, he'd rack and stretch them. Too tall, he'd lop off their limbs.\n\"The white gaze is Procrustean,\" Yancy said. \"It makes the black body conform to its expectations.\"\nArbery must've been a thief. Trayvon Martin was up to no good. Michael Brown struck terror. Tamir Rice looked much older than 12. Toy guns and cell phones, \"seen through the white gaze,\" become weapons, he said.\n2014: Trayvon's mom: Brown's burial will hurt 04:04\n\"The black body is oversaturated with violence. The wallet phantasmatically becomes a gun,\" said Yancy, who doesn't jog in white neighborhoods or walk with his cell phone out.\nLike many killings, Floyd's fits the mold of a lynching, he said. A white man, acting on fear, impulsively and extrajudicially exacted gratuitous violence on a man he deemed a criminal, he said.\n\"Why did George Floyd deserve to have a knee on his neck for that amount of time?\" Yancy asked. \"You don't have to do anything to be found guilty. It's just enough that you're black. ... Lynching as a form of anti-black violence continues, but all of the multiple ways in which the lynching takes place have shifted.\"\nThe disrupter\nMorris Dees, co-founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center, represented the mother of Michael Donald against the United Klans of America, members of which beat and hanged her teen son in 1981.\nThe $7 million verdict in the civil case was credited with bankrupting the Klan, transforming it from an organized nationwide outfit into a coalition of loose cells.\nSome have dubbed Donald's the last lynching in America. While Donald's killing was \"the last (lynching) where they threw a rope around someone's neck and hung him from a tree,\" Dees said, he's torn on whether the term can be applied to the killings America's seen of late.\nIn Arbery's case, \"that's certainly a vicious, racist killing. There's no question about it,\" he said, and Floyd's death and Breonna Taylor's death in Louisville, Kentucky, are examples of police excessive force.\n\"All these are extrajudicial actions cops took and had no basis in doing it,\" Dees said.\nThe morning Michael Donald's body was found 01:07\n(One officer has been charged with murder, and three others with aiding and abetting, in Floyd's death. The FBI is investigating Taylor's and Arbery's deaths. Lawyers for the men accused of killing Arbery say the video of his killing doesn't tell the whole story.)\nPeople can make cases they're lynchings -- and they bear similar hallmarks -- but it \"wouldn't fit the true definition,\" he said. He prefers a more traditional definition, involving mobs taking the law into their own hands or targeting someone based on race.\nHe concedes defining the word can get fuzzy. Some might not consider the 1988 murder of Mulugeta Seraw in Portland, Oregon, a lynching, but white supremacists picked the Ethiopian student at random and beat him to death with a baseball bat.\nIt's \"about as (terrible) a lynching as you'd ever want to see,\" he said.\nIn 1990, Dees and the SPLC went after the White Aryan Resistance, of which Seraw's killers were members, and won a $12.5 million civil verdict.\n\"We put them out of business,\" Dees said.\nThe mother and son\nSo, lynch mobs may be considered relics, but Dameon Shepard feels sure he encountered one last month in Pender County, North Carolina.\n\"The whole lynching thing, it's not as brutal now as it was back in the day, but I don't think it's something that's gone away. It's still here,\" he said.\nThe 18-year-old answered his door May 3 to about 15 people, including a uniformed deputy from the next county over. Three men, including the officer, were armed. They were looking for an African American teen they mistakenly thought was with a missing girl.\n\"I had to remember I'm a black male. People look at me a certain way,\" Dameon Shepard says.\nDameon told them they had the wrong house. They wouldn't believe him, and the officer wedged his foot in the door, he said. The commotion woke his mother.\n\"They were convinced that they had the right person, and basically that we were lying,\" Monica Shepard recalled.\nAfter a frightening spell, she convinced them they were in the wrong place, and neighbors called police. No one was hurt, but it reminded her of what she's read about the 1923 Rosewood massacre in Florida, where white men hunted down blacks to avenge a supposed assault on a white woman.\nThe group was \"basically a lynch mob,\" she said, but the term's not entirely accurate. Lynchings are hangings, she said. Dameon, though, prefers lynch mob.\n\"That's a pretty accurate name for the group,\" he said. \"It wasn't that far from having a whip back in the old days. They had intentions. They were looking for an African American for a crime against a white female.\n\"If I was that person at the door, I don't know what they would've done to him, to me.\"\nFortunately, Dameon and his mother had had \"the talk\" -- the black boys' rite where parents explain they will be treated differently for their skin -- and he knew not to escalate the situation, he said.\nMonica Shepard says she finds herself checking on Dameon more often since the incident.\n\"Being a black man in America, you can't do and say things that others get away with, and I've instilled that in him since he was 8 years old,\" his mother said. She's never had the conversation with her two daughters.\nMonica Shepard is still on edge. Despite an outpouring of support from her mostly white neighbors and graduation cards arriving from strangers all over the country, she still worries. She's been hugging Dameon and asking his whereabouts more frequently, she said.\n\"I don't want to make him feel nervous and anxious, but I do find myself checking on him more.\"\nThe sociologist\nStewart Tolnay has spent significant effort quantifying America's lynchings. He and his fellow academics have identified thousands. Still, the University of Washington sociology professor knows all his noble efforts won't yield a real tally.\n\"Ultimately, we will never know the full and exact extent of lynching in the United States, as many lynchings are undoubtedly lost entirely to the historical record,\" said Tolnay, whose books include \"A Festival of Violence: An Analysis of Southern Lynchings, 1882-1930.\"\nWhile he considers Arbery's death a lynching, he's more restrained when it comes to other recent cases. He believes Floyd and Taylor would be alive if they were white, he said, but he cautions against calling all racial homicides lynchings.\n\"To the extent the term has a cache that's important to us, it loses its meaning,\" he said.\nWords matter, especially when it comes to this hurtful history, he said.\nMalik Muhammad marches during an Ahmaud Arbery protest in Brunswick, Georgia, last month.\n\"It does give greater impact and meaning to a modern-day incident to call it a lynching,\" he said.\nLynchings were a form of social control, designed to foster racial divisions and discourage blacks from aspiring, he said, and there are myriad studies looking at links between lynchings and crime today.\nThe growing body of research examines whether areas that embraced lynchings decades ago have more white-on-black homicides, more corporal punishment in school, less hate crime legislation (or zeal to enforce it) and more death penalty cases, he said. University of New Mexico researchers are exploring \"potential pathways that lynching violence in the past might connect with contemporary police violence.\"\n\"There seems to be some historical legacy that connects the present to the past,\" Tolnay said. \"To say historical lynchings have no bearing on today overlooks all of that evidence.\"\nThe granddaughter\nAtanya Hayes was not yet born when a mob dragged her grandfather, Roger Malcom, 24, and three sharecroppers down a wagon trail to the Apalachee River in Walton County, Georgia, beat them and shot them repeatedly.\nYet she still feels pain. She still craves justice. She also sees links between today's violence and the sharecroppers' 1946 deaths known as the Moore's Ford lynchings.\nArbery? Floyd? Taylor? All lynchings, she said. Americans too often grant benefits of the doubt when police kill, the 50-year-old added.\n\"Things are different about today, but there are so many similarities,\" she said. \"Calling it a lynching elevates it so people can understand why it's so hurtful to us. ... When we use lynching in today's society, that's the wound that's opened.\"\nCoroner W.T. Brown places a sheet over the body of one of four Moore's Ford lynching victims in 1946.\nShe fights for justice in the 74-year-old Moore's Ford killings because the laws that prohibited her grandfather's killing also prohibited Arbery's, Floyd's and Taylor's, in her mind.\n\"At the time they did this, it was illegal. It was illegal then. It's illegal now,\" she said. \"With my grandfather, it was kind of expected. It shouldn't be happening now.\"\nIt bothers her that her granddad's killers died with their reputations intact, especially when racism permeated the investigation, she said. Gov. Eugene Talmadge was an avowed racist, and his head of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, Samuel Roper, later became an imperial wizard of the Ku Klux Klan.\nIn her latest battle, Hayes wants 16 days of grand jury testimony -- yielding no murder charges -- unsealed, which the US Justice Department is fighting, citing the importance of grand jury secrecy. She resents her government fighting her. To her, it's the same as holding the Nazis accountable for the Holocaust, she said.\n\"You feel helpless to the extent you feel hopeless,\" she said. \"We might not have shackles that ring and clatter, but we have shackles, and there's nothing you can do about it.\"\nThe lawyer\nHayes' hopes rest with New Jersey attorney Joseph Bell, who worked with historian Anthony Pitch to unseal the grand jury transcripts after Pitch discovered them in the National Archives a few years ago.\nPitch, who died last year, wrote a book on Moore's Ford called \"The Last Lynching.\" The title was the publisher's idea, Bell said, and Pitch was troubled by it.\nBell realizes most, if not all, of the Moore's Ford killers are dead, but the case -- which a former SPLC president once called \"one of the unfinished chapters of the civil rights movement\" -- was too important not to pursue till the end, he said.\nThe FBI was dispatched to Monroe for its maiden civil rights investigation. President Harry Truman established a committee on civil rights after Southern Democrats blocked his anti-lynching bill. Also, Bell said, George Dorsey, 28, one of the sharecroppers, was a World War II veteran who fought for a country that loathed him.\n\"This man had the courage to wear the uniform of this country and spent five years on the Pacific and North African fronts,\" Bell said. \"These men put their lives on the line and to come back here and be treated as less than a man, as a servant -- he was a sharecropper -- it's a complete disregard for people.\"\nA Monroe, Georgia, church hosts the 1946 funerals of George Dorsey and Dorothy Malcom.\nWalton County locals have told him he's just stirring up trouble, and one black resident warned him, \"They'll make history out of you in 30 seconds,\" he recalled. (In 2007, an elderly white woman in Walton County told a CNN journalist reporting on Moore's Ford to leave those \"poor people\" alone. She was referring to the killers.)\n\"The fear and terror continues to stalk the land near where the four bodies were found near the Moore's Ford bridge,\" Bell said.\nHe's incredulous the FBI interviewed 2,790 people without a single arrest, though Georgia State Patrol Maj. William Spence famously told media at the time, \"The best people in town won't talk.\"\n\"This was a complete injustice. This was the assassination of four African Americans and one distinguished World War II veteran, who died like roadkill,\" he said. \"We look to courts to be the bastion of truth and justice. Why was there no one who was prosecuted for these heinous acts?\"\nHe will take his records request to the US Supreme Court in August, when he asks the high court to reconsider a lower federal court's decision not to release them.\n\"The truth is always important,\" he said, \"to find out if there was complicity.\""}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/07/us/iyw-university-rebuild-minneapolis-trnd/index.html", "headline": "Minneapolis theater community uses stagecraft skills to support businesses of color in the aftermath of protests", "published_date": "2020-06-07", "text": "(CNN)As Minneapolis recovers from nights of unrest following the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who died under the knee of a white police officer, damaged local businesses are finding help from a community with a unique skillset -- theater production.\nMembers of the Minneapolis theater community are leveraging their love of set design, carpentry and their city to help local businesses secure their properties by patching up broken windows and doors.

But it's a great time to be an American", "published_date": "2020-07-04", "text": "(CNN)On July 9, 1776, a rowdy group of American colonists banded together at a political rally in New York City and did something that today would be called \"badass.\"\nThey had just been treated to a public reading of the Declaration of Independence, which Congress had officially adopted less than a week earlier. After hearing calls to \"dissolve the political bands\" of tyranny, they marched to a public park that featured a statue of King George III, Britain's ruler, and knocked the 4,000-pound statue off its 15-foot pedestal.\nThe head of the statue was then decapitated and perched on top of a spike, and much of the rest was melted down to make 42,000 musket balls for American soldiers.\nThe historian Erika Doss thought of that scene recently while watching protesters toppling statues of Confederate heroes. Doss, who recounts the 1776 episode in her book, \"Memorial Mania,\" sees a parallel between the colonists who fought against Great Britain and protesters who rail against Confederate monuments today.\nA man holds a Black Lives Matter sign during a protest against racial inequality on June 23, 2020, in Boston.\n\"They're patriots,\" says Doss, an American studies professor at the University of Notre Dame, of today's protesters. \"They're looking at the symbols and these visual and martial emblems and icons in their midst and they're saying this doesn't stand for who we are today.\"\nIt's easy to be cynical this Fourth of July weekend as the US celebrates its birth. The country seems like a mess. Racial protests have rocked every major city. Unemployment has soared. And Americans can't even agree if they should wear face masks in the middle of a pandemic.\nBut what some see as chaos, others see as an explosion of patriotism. They see it in the armies of Americans that took to the streets to protest racism. They see it in the companies that are taking unprecedented stands against racial and social injustice.\nEven the Americans who are wearing masks for the health of their neighbors -- they, too, are reasons to wave the flag.\nA group of Bostonians dressed as Native Americans dump crates of imported British tea into Boston Harbor as a protest against the British Tea Act in 1773.\nAll of these different groups have declared their independence from symbols and ideas that they've decided no longer represent them, Doss and others say.\nThey are doing what their ancestors did in 1776, Doss says: \"They are reimagining themselves and the nation.\"\nAmerica is bending toward justice\nThe evidence of this reimagining is reflected in the headlines.\nSomething has shifted in America when the Mississippi state flag, which bears the cross of the Confederate battle flag, is taken down while the popularity of the Black Lives Matter movement soars to an all-time high.

She wants a different legacy for her son\nTrump is doing what Obama couldn't\nBlack Lives Matter has been described as everything from a hashtag to a \"symbol of hate.\" But the movement has rarely been described as something else: one of the finest examples of patriotism in modern America.\nThe protesters who flooded the streets this spring to protest racism exemplify the revolutionary spirit of America just as much as the white colonists in powdered wigs, says Melanye Price, a professor at Prairie View A&M University in Texas who specializes in African-American politics.\nA protester carries a US flag upside down, a sign of distress, next to a burning building on May 28, 2020, in Minneapolis.\n\"The people who are out yelling in the streets today are no different than Paul Revere yelling 'The British are coming!''' says Price. \"It's the American way to voice criticism of the government and to rebel against oppressive forces.\"\nIn some ways, the protesters who took to the streets this year did a better job of honoring the words of the Declaration of Independence than the Founding Fathers, she says.\nMany of our nation's founders were slave owners who treated Black Americans as tools for economic profit. When they said, \"all men are created equal,\" that didn't include Black people, who were not considered fully human. They didn't consider women equal, either.\nBut Black people extracted concepts from the Declaration of Independence, like the right to protest, and \"turned them into tools for American citizenship,\" Price says. \"They took the words of the founders and rammed them up their damn throats.\"\nWe've expanded the definition of an American hero\nIt's easy to forget, but the person who became the catalyst the American Revolution was not a White man. He was half Black and half Native American. His name was Crispus Attucks, and he was killed during the 1770 Boston Massacre, an event that sparked the Revolutionary War.\nThe person who sparked the unprecedented wave of racial protests this year was also a Black man. George Floyd, who died while being arrested in May by Minneapolis police, is in some ways a modern-day Attucks, says Jerald Podair, a historian at Lawrence University in Wisconsin.\n\"Attucks died not knowing what his impact and significance would be, as did George Floyd,\" says Podair.\nHistory textbooks tell us that American heroes are almost always White men carrying guns. A reader has to dig to learn about people like Sacagawea, the Native American woman whose language skills and bravery saved the vaunted Lewis & Clark expedition of the early 19th century.\nAn image based on an iconic painting, \"Spirit of '76,\" that depicts American patriots of the colonial era.\nThis year's protests, though, have enlarged the definition of a what an American hero looks like. Some of the leaders and participants in Black Lives Matter protests are LGBTQ. The movement is multiracial and multiethnic.\nAnd in some ways these protesters are just as tough as their colonial forebears.\nThe history books love to tell stories of the Minutemen, the elite band of Revolutionary War soldiers who were ready at a minute's notice to rush into battle. The Black Lives Matter protesters and others who recently took to the streets to demonstrate were not that different. They risked their lives, often on short notice via a text or social media alert, to demonstrate against racism in the middle of a pandemic.\nAge made no difference. Many of those demonstrators were young -- some even too young to vote. They took rubber bullets to the face and swallowed tear gas. And then they came back the next day, like soldiers.\nIf you think that characterization is hyperbolic, listen to the words of another American hero who praised millennials -- people born between 1981 and 1996 -- in a recent speech. He said the country's youth make him optimistic about the future.\n\"They're not a lot like my generation -- in many ways, they are better,\" he said. \"They care so much about their friends, they care about the issues, they question things in a way that I'm not sure we baby boomers questioned.

William McRaven, the Navy SEAL who oversaw the Osama bin Laden raid.\nA man waves an American flag with the words \"Not Free\" on it at a Juneteenth rally in Washington on June 19, 2020.\nThe coronavirus pandemic has also enlarged the definition of an American hero. We've learned that courage isn't just manifested in a SEAL team raid. It also can be summoned in mundane places like a health clinic, a grocery store or a meatpacking plant.\nThe pandemic has led many Americans to realize how dependent they are on these service workers, who risk their lives to keep the country running.\nThe colonists often invoked the term \"liberty\" to celebrate a form of rugged individualism where government and rules left them alone so they could live their version of freedom. So do many modern-day Americans. But democracy also depends on a sense of shared community, says Podair, the Lawrence University historian.\n\"Our life and health depends on the behavior of other people,\" he says. \"We depend on our neighbor, sometimes to get us food or just to remain healthy -- and they on us. Because of the pandemic, America is a more democratic nation today than it was in February.\"\nOur country is finally facing one of its original sins\nThe Black Lives Matter protesters may exceed the Founding Fathers in another way -- they're forcing the nation to face its racism.\nWhen Thomas Jefferson drafted the Declaration of Independence, he added language that described the slave trade as a perverse plot by an evil English king to contaminate the colonies, Joseph J. Ellis recounts in \"Founding Brothers,\" his Pulitzer Prize-winning book.\nThat passage, though was deleted by the Continental Congress in the final draft. The issue was so contentious and ingrained in colonial society that many founders thought abolishing slavery would kill the young nation in its infancy, Ellis wrote.\nBut a new generation of Americans are determined to do what the Founding Fathers refused to do.\nThe Rev. William Barber, president of Repairers of the Breach, speaks in Washington on June 12, 2019.\nAmericans are devouring books on racism and corporate America is taking a stand against racial injustice. Ordinary people are talking about racism with a new depth that's remarkable, says Doss, the historian.\n\"It has been so interesting to see how words like white supremacy and imperialism are part of daily American vocabulary in ways now that were not a couple of years ago,\" she says.\nThis change didn't just happen. It took years of planning and activism.\n\"A multiracial fusion coalition has shifted public opinion in this country, and we've seen a tipping point in the past month,\" says the Rev. William Barber II, a 2018 MacArthur Foundation \"genius\" grant winner and president of Repairers of the Breach, a nonpartisan group that seeks to build a moral agenda around issues of poverty and racism.\n\"Many of us have been building this coalition for years, taking up the work of those who came before us,\" he says. \"We never knew when the tipping point would come, but we are now in a moment where there is a public consensus that America must address the legacy of her original sin in systemic racism.\"\nAt the same time, there appears to be flagging interest in white grievance. It's not just Confederate monuments that are coming down. A core political tactic that relied on coded racist appeals may also be starting to topple.\nA statue of Confederate Commander Richard W. Dowling is removed in Houston, Texas, on June 17, 2020.\nIn the 1960s the Republican Party quietly began its \"Southern Strategy\" of using terms like \"forced busing\" and \"state's rights\" to play on racial fears and win elections. Democrats have also used such appeals, but not to the extent Republicans have.\nBut racial dog whistles just don't hunt like they used to. President Trump is offering proof. He's opposing any effort by the US military to rename bases that bear the name of Confederate commanders. He also called Black Lives Matter a \"symbol of hate.\"\nAnd as of now he's losing badly to Democratic challenger Joe Biden in the polls.\n\"When we look back, we may well realize that there was indeed one last presidential election that could be won on white racial resentment \u2014 but that election happened in 2016,\" Paul Waldman said in a recent Washington Post column.\nWillie Townsend, an employee of the Mississippi State Capitol, on June 30, 2020, hours before Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves signed a bill into law replacing the current state flag.\nProtesters in 2020, though, want more than an end to racist speech. Barber, for example, has helped launch a Poor People's Campaign and his group plans an array of activities around the Fourth of July this weekend.\n\"We can't get sidelined into little reforms around the edges,\" Barber says. \"This isn't just about bringing down a flag or banning chokeholds. We are in a moment that demands a Third Reconstruction to guarantee freedom and equal justice. We must push to become the America that has never yet been.\"\nThat kind of America may seem far off right now.

He used to write magazine articles and ran a YouTube channel dedicated to the sport. He loves the energy at the races, the camaraderie of the campgrounds and the sound of cars roaring by. Everyone, he said, should go to a race at least once.\nNASCAR bans Confederate flags at all races, events\nIn recent years, however, he pulled away from NASCAR because he felt it had inadequately addressed social issues like police brutality and racial injustice.\n\"It didn't feel like I belonged there anymore,\" Wiley said, \"or at least that my voice wasn't heard there anymore.\"\nThat changed this week when NASCAR announced it would ban the Confederate flag from races, just days after the only full-time African American driver in NASCAR's Cup Series, Bubba Wallace, donned a shirt emblazoned \"I can't breathe\" and unveiled a Black Lives Matter paint scheme in the wake of protests sparked by the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.\n\"That was huge,\" Wiley said.\nFor African American NASCAR fans who spoke to CNN, the Confederate flag ban and Wallace's decision to be more outspoken about race are welcome but overdue changes in a sport they felt had failed to be inclusive in the past. For them, being a black fan has meant years of feeling overlooked, of ignoring hurtful remarks by their favorite drivers, and steering clear of fans and campsites who they feared would be unwelcoming.\nBut now, they're hoping to see more people who look like them at the racetrack.\n\"I'm really excited about the direction the sport's headed in, and I haven't been able to say that for a couple years now,\" Wiley said.\nBubba Wallace, the only full-time African American driver in NASCAR's Cup Series, wears a T-shirt that says \"I Can't Breathe\" and \"Black Lives Matter\" during the National Anthem before the NASCAR Cup Series Folds of Honor QuikTrip 500 at Atlanta Motor Speedway on June 7, 2020.\n'It meant the world'\nNASCAR announced the Confederate flag ban Wednesday, writing in a statement that the flag's presence at NASCAR events \"runs contrary to our commitment to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all fans, our competitors and our industry.\"\n\"Bringing people together around a love for racing and the community that it creates is what makes our fans and sport special,\" the statement said.\nMany in and outside NASCAR's fan base praised the stock car racing league. Among those supporters was Mark Mosley, who told CNN his kids joke that he's the only black man on the south side of Chicago who likes NASCAR.\nMosley admitted he's struggled with his love of the sport. Over the years, Mosley said he's probably taken 10 friends to Chicagoland Speedway, hoping to convince them they could like NASCAR, too.\n\"None of them wanted to return because of the environment,\" he said. \"Half of them left halfway through the race.\"\nStatue removals show change is coming \u2014 even in the capital of the Confederacy\nWhen former driver Richard Petty \u2014 Mosley's \"idol\" growing up \u2014 came out against kneeling during the National Anthem, Mosley said it was like a dagger to the heart. He decided to stop watching altogether after driver Kyle Larson used the n-word in a virtual racing event in April. \"I gave up on NASCAR, to be honest.\"\nBut he changed his mind this week.\n\"I was elated, excited, happy, any positive adjective or adverb you can think of,\" he said of the flag ban. \"It meant the world to me as an African American NASCAR fan.\"\nAnother fan, Alex Burns, said he felt alienated from the rest of the fan base at times.\nWalking around a track or in the campgrounds, Burns said he kept his \"head on the swivel,\" avoiding campsites where people were drinking and flying the Confederate flag.\nWhile that feeling never deterred Burns from enjoying the sport, he said he's \"very proud of NASCAR\" for banning the flag.\n\"I'm even more of a fan of NASCAR,\" he said, adding later, \"I just hope people understand that, you know, it's time for change.\"\n'There aren't a lot of people who look like me'\nBrehanna Daniels \u2014 the first black woman to pit in a NASCAR national series race \u2014 also supports the flag ban.\n\"I'm very proud of NASCAR right now,\" Daniels told CNN in an interview. \"We're moving on up the ladder.

I'm behind NASCAR all the way, but I felt that was dividing us.\"\nBurns told CNN that while the flag may be part of history, it represents \"a bad time in history where we as black people were enslaved.\"\n\"In terms of history, \" Mosley said, \"history has proven that blacks have always been mistreated. So historically speaking, to me, (the Confederate flag) represents hate.\"\n'We're being listened to'\nA big part of the NASCAR experience is hanging out at campsites within the track's infield leading up to a race, Wiley said. But whenever he saw the Confederate flag flying at a campsite, \"it was an indication to me of like, I don't know what these people are about.\"\nBubba Wallace says there's more good than bad in fan reaction to NASCAR's Confederate flag ban\n\"You want to be part of this whole big family atmosphere,\" he said. \"But at the same time it's like, I don't know if I'm welcome here.\"\nOver the years, as he became more aware of social issues like police brutality, Wiley felt NASCAR failed to reach out to black fans. Even as the Black Lives Matter movement grew, Wiley said, \"NASCAR was still very much on the side of, 'Blue Lives Matter, we support our law enforcement, we support the military,' everything else.\"\n\"I didn't mind them saying we support law enforcement,\" he said. \"But at the same time, to completely ignore the other side of the argument was kind of insulting to me.\"\nIn 2015, after nine black churchgoers were massacred at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, NASCAR issued a statement saying it would continue \"to disallow use of the Confederate Flag symbol in any officials NASCAR capacity.\" But it stopped short of an outright ban, and Wiley wondered if it would ever happen.\nBut he felt NASCAR had no choice. In recent years, NASCAR has dealt with a narrative of declining viewership and attendance. Without efforts to be more inclusive, Wiley felt \"they're not going to make it.\"\n\"There aren't enough people who still believe in this to sustain it.\"\nBubba Wallace with his Black Lives Matter car before the start of a NASCAR Cup Series race in Martinsville, Virginia, on June 10, 2020.\nThat's why black NASCAR fans are excited. They hope this change will help attract more black and brown fans to the sport.\nFor Wiley, the ban and Wallace's Black Lives Matter paint scheme were \"one of the most uplifting things\" for a fan who's felt disconnected from NASCAR for a long time.\n\"We're accepted and we're being listened to \u2014 in this space,\" he said. \"Finally.\"\n\"NASCAR needs more diversity,\" Daniels said. \"And with the recent things that have happened, a lot of minorities are saying, 'Hey, when's the next race? I'm trying to come.'\"\n\"With more of that,\" she said, \"NASCAR will have a bigger audience, a bigger crowd.\"\nOne day, Daniels hopes she'll look up from the pit road and see a sea of diverse faces looking back at her.\n\"That would be a sight to see, wouldn't it?\"\nCNN's Steve Almasy, Katherine Jennings, Allen Kim, Keith O'Shea and Amir Vera contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/14/us/george-floyd-national-police-reforms/index.html", "headline": "Police reforms quickly take hold across America.

Trump was widely criticized after peaceful protesters were forcefully dispersed outside the White House this month with chemical irritants before a presidential photo opportunity.\n\"This administration not only retreated from law enforcement reforms but you see the president and the attorney general act in ways that are hostile to the community and encouraging bad conduct by police,\" said Smith, executive director of the Washington Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs in Washington.\n\"That's why communities are so angry and demanding such profound change right now.\"\nFrom coastal cities to mid America, the protests continue to grow.\nFederal legislation focuses on de-escalation and training\nDemocrats propose legislation to reform police force 02:09\nOne response to the demands of protesters was legislation aimed at police brutality and racial injustice introduced this week by Democrats.\nThe legislation is the most expansive effort in recent years to address national policing practices at a federal level. But it faces resistance from Republicans, police unions and some local officials.\nHere's how Washington is trying to reform the police\nThe sweeping bill includes a ban on chokeholds and the creation of a National Police Misconduct Registry \"to prevent problem officers from changing jurisdictions to avoid accountability,\" according to a summary document.\n\"Banning chokeholds will help save lives and reduce harm starting now,\" Lopez said. \"It seems to me that is a no-brainer.\"\nAt least 20 US cities and municipalities are starting to ban or have banned the use of choke holds, according to tally by CNN.\nThose cities include Philadelphia, Phoenix, Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Diego, Miami, Chicago, Washington, D.C., Minneapolis, New York City, Denver and Houston.\n\"Most departments have not allowed chokeholds for decades,\" said Joe Gamaldi, national vice president of the Fraternal Order of Police, which represents more than 350,000 US law enforcement officers.\nBlack former US ambassadors call for reforms to address police brutality and systemic racism\n\"We're supportive of de-escalation training. Most departments are already doing that. But if there needs to be a standard training and policy from the federal government on de-escalation we can be supportive of that.\"\nThe House Democrats' bill sets certain restrictions on the transfer of military-grade equipment to state and local law enforcement and requires federal uniformed police offers to wear body cameras. It also mandates racial bias training and teaching officers about their \"duty to intervene.\"\n\"The answer typically for a police scandal is, 'We'll just do more training,'\" Futterman said. \"It's the easy thing to do... Without a doubt police officers need to be better trained and taught to de-escalate. There need to be stricter policies that ... prevent collusion after an incident of accused misconduct, that officers are separated like witnesses are separated and not allowed to speak with one another.\"\nLawmakers target 'qualified immunity'\nThe federal legislation would take aim at the legal doctrine known as \"qualified immunity,\" which shields law enforcement from lawsuits alleging they violated the constitutional rights of people.\nThe 40-year-old doctrine shields officers and government officials from accountability, according to critics. Supporters argue that it protects an officer's ability to make a snap decision during potentially dangerous situations.\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said ending qualified immunity is a top priority for Democrats in any bipartisan talks that could occur.\nA&E cancels 'Live PD' police series as protests against police brutality continue\nTrump considers ending qualified immunity \"a nonstarter,\" said White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany.\n\"One of the ways in which officers have regularly escaped accountability, even when they've been found to have violated people's civil and constitutional rights, is by that doctrine of qualified immunity that protects all but the most malicious and plainly incompetent acts of policing,\" Futterman said.\nAdditionally, police union contracts often make it tougher to remove officers flagged for misconduct, according to government and former police officials and labor experts. Some union agreements outline how long police must wait to investigate an incident, how they can question officers and what they can ask, and how quickly investigations must be completed.\nMinneapolis police are rarely disciplined for complaints, records show\nJim Pasco, executive director of the national Fraternal Order of Police, the country's largest and most powerful law enforcement union, said his organization will sit down with \"anybody, anytime who wants to have a fact-based discussion\" on public and police safety, and that these discussions were ongoing.\n\"I think it's hard to see a silver lining at the moment but, long term, situations like this provide an opportunity for growth,\" Gamaldi said. \"Make no mistake: Nobody hates a bad cop more than a good cop.\"\nMinneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo said this week he was withdrawing from contract negotiations with the police union, which he accused of constraining reform.\nThe Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis urged the chief and the city to return to contract negotiations.

Andrew Cuomo: Police reform is long overdue 02:18\nOn Friday in New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed what he called the \"most aggressive\" police reform legislative package in the nation in a move intended to make officers more accountable.\nA key measure in the legislation -- vehemently opposed by a coalition of law enforcement unions -- will shatter the veil of secrecy that a 1976 law provided police personnel and disciplinary records.\nThe controversial law prevents the release of disciplinary records for police officers, firefighters or corrections officers without their written consent. The statute is known as Section 50-a of the New York State Civil Rights Law, which was enacted to exempt police officers from being cross-examined during criminal prosecutions, according to the bill.\nThe unions expressed concerns that all complaints -- including those not fully investigated or substantiated -- will be released. The coalition said judges already have discretion on releasing such records and that it worried officers would not have a chance to be heard.\n7 Los Angeles officers removed from their field duties after using excessive force during protests, police say\nChauvin, the ex-Minneapolis cop charged with killing Floyd, had 18 prior internal affairs complaints filed against him. He received reprimands for two of them. The nature of the complaints is unclear.\n\"We've been too willing to give police a pass on oversight,\" Lopez said.\nOfficers who engage in egregious abuse have usually amassed numerous complaints over many years, according to Futterman.\n\"No department in the United States has regularly been using that information ... to investigate the obvious patterns of abuse and then seeking to get rid off and fire officers or groups of officers who have no business with a badge or a gun,\" he said.\nThe New York state legislation will designate the attorney general as an independent prosecutor in cases involving civilian deaths.\n\"It's the age old question of who polices the police, and what we've seen is that police have proven incapable of policing themselves,\" Futterman said. \"This is one of the things that police departments across the nation do the worst.\"\nThere are calls to defund police agencies\nBlack police officer: I feel torn between my race and my badge 02:40\nThe uproar for change has led to drastic calls for action in some places.\nIn Minneapolis, a veto-proof supermajority of the city council is considering a dismantling of the police department.\nNew York and Los Angeles are vowing millions of dollars in police funding cuts.\nLopez called the proposals to slash police funding \"the most intentionally transformative moves\" of the moment.\n\"But they concern me a little because they happened so quickly and I don't think it's a good idea ... to just pick a number and say slash the budget by that much or get rid of this number of officers without doing the work to figure out what's going to replace that and what you actually want your law enforcement to do,\" she said.\n10 SWAT members in South Florida resign from unit, saying they feel unsafely restrained by politics\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a shift of police department funding to youth and social services.\nA group of city council members proposes to cut $1 billion from the NYPD's nearly $6 billion budget. Freddi Goldstein, the mayor's press secretary, told CNN on Saturday that de Blasio is \"committed to reprioritizing funding and looking for savings, but he does not believe a $1 billion cut is the way to maintain safety.\"\nIn Los Angeles, Mayor Eric Garcetti agreed to slash between $100 million and $150 million in proposed LAPD funding after Californians decried a proposal to increase its budget to $1.86 billion.\nThe People's Budget LA Coalition called Garcetti's pledge \"a start\" but said a $150 million cut would \"still leave LAPD with 51% of the city's unrestricted revenues.\"\n\"That's astonishing,\" Lopez said of the amount remaining after the proposed cut. \"To think what that money could be spent for and the good that it can do for communities. It strikes me as probably a good first step in LA and other communities should be looking at similar approaches.\"\nIn New York, Cuomo signed an executive order Friday making state funding to police contingent on law enforcement agencies developing a plan by April 1 to \"reinvent and modernize police strategies,\" including use of force guidelines. Those plans would be enacted into law after consultation with the community.\nMinneapolis police officers pen open letter condemning former officer Derek Chauvin\nGamaldi, the Fraternal Order of Police national vice president, dismissed calls to defund or disband police departments as \"a knee jerk reaction.\"\n\"It's very, very dangerous and all it's going to do is hurt our low income communities because they rely on us a great deal, and higher income communities are simply going to hire their own private security or police officers,\" he said.\nAcevedo, Houston's police chief, called the disbanding of a police department \"an invitation to chaos.\"\nBut defunding can shift policing money to badly needed mental health, domestic violence, homeless and educational services.\nSan Francisco Mayor London Breed, for instance, is proposing city police officers stop responding to issues like disputes between neighbors, reports about homeless people and school discipline interventions.\nThere's a growing call to defund the police. Here's what it means\n\"Police officers would be the first people to tell you, 'We're being asked to solve all the nation's problems and we're not equipped to do so,\" Futterman said.\nSmith, the executive director of the Washington Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs, said police reform efforts in America have been down this path many times.\n\"The movement for racial justice in our criminal system is not going to happen with new, changing legislation,\" he said. \"It's a big project and it's going to take time and effort.\"\nIn 2016, Philando Castile was fatally shot by police during a traffic stop in Minnesota.

Andrew Cuomo signs package of sweeping police reform bills", "published_date": "2020-06-12", "text": "(CNN)New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Friday signed what he called the \"most aggressive\" police reform legislative package in the nation in a move that makes officers more accountable and criminalizes chokeholds and other controversial restraints.\nThe bills -- vehemently opposed by a coalition of law enforcement unions -- ffollows weeks of protests nationwide. Legislative efforts targeting police violence have taken hold nationally after the deaths of several African Americans at the hands of the police, including George Floyd, who died in Minneapolis last month after a white police officer knelt on his neck for more than eight minutes.\n\"The truth is this police reform is long overdue and Mr. Floyd's murder is just the most recent murder,\" Cuomo said Friday. \"It's not just about Mr. Floyd's murder. It's about being here before, many, many times before.\"\nAdditionally, Cuomo signed an executive order making state funding to police contingent on New York agencies developing a plan by April 1 -- to be enacted into law after consultation with the community -- to \"reinvent and modernize police strategies,\" including use of force guidelines.\nRihanna, Ariana Grande and more artists sign open letter calling for police reform in New York\n\"We're not going to fund police agencies in this state that do not look at what has been happening, come to terms with it, and reform themselves,\" he said.\nA key measure signed on Friday involves shattering the veil of secrecy that a 1976 law provided police personnel and disciplinary records.\n\"Today is about enough is enough,\" he said.\nThe governor was joined by the mothers of two victims of police violence, activist the Rev. Al Sharpton and others at the bill signing in Manhattan.\nSharpton said Cuomo's executive action on police funding \"raised the bar\" and called on other states to follow suit.\nCuomo and state lawmakers agreed to advance a package of significant policing policy changes that had stalled for years because of opposition from law enforcement circles. The state Senate and Assembly by Wednesday passed 10 policing bills.\nOn Friday Cuomo signed four out of the 10 bills into law. The other six bills await his signature.\nGeorge Floyd protests have made police reform the consensus position\n\"We are at a moment of reckoning there's no question about it,\" Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins said Friday. \"We know this isn't a cure ... We know this is the beginning but it's a move to bring justice to a system that has long been unjust.\"\nA coalition of law enforcement unions and associations consider the legislation \"anti-police.\"\nOne measure outlaws the use of police chokeholds. It is named after Eric Garner, an African American man who died as a result of a police chokehold during a 2014 arrest.\nChokeholds were already prohibited by the NYPD at the time of Garner's death but the new law makes the use of \"a chokehold or similar restraint\" that causes injury or death a class C felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison.\nThe bill amending the controversial law preventing disciplinary records for police officers, firefighters or corrections officers to be released without their written consent dates to 1976. The statute is known as Section 50-a of the New York State Civil Rights Law, which was enacted to exempt police officers from being cross-examined during criminal prosecutions, according to the bill.\nThese groups are fighting police reform 02:33\nNew York Police Department officials have acknowledged the need for more transparency.\nPowerful police unions, including the Police Benevolent Association, said the legislation reflected will result in unfair policies.\nThe coalition said in a statement that it worried all police complaints -- including those not fully investigated or substantiated -- will be released. It says a judge already has discretion on releasing such records and there are concerns officers would not have a chance to be heard.\nCuomo also signed a bill that designates the attorney general as an independent prosecutor for matters relating to the deaths of unarmed civilians caused by law enforcement. The measure is technically codifying an executive order Cuomo mandated in 2014 in the wake of Garner's death.\nLegislators also took aim at incidents like the recent viral video of Amy Cooper calling 911 on a black man at Central Park.

But some city lawmakers -- and the protesters calling for change -- think the cuts weren't sweeping enough.\nThe City Council approved the $88.9 billion 2021 budget late Tuesday night while hundreds of protesters, many of whom have camped outside City Hall for a week, waited to hear the results.\nThe New York Police Department is the largest force in the US and employs over 55,000. The department budget was almost $6 billion for the 2020 fiscal year.\nThe approved budget includes nearly $484 million in cuts and will reallocate $354 million to other agencies \"best positioned to carry out the duties that have been previously assigned to the New York Police Department, like the Department of Education, the Department of Health & Mental Hygiene and the Department of Homeless Services. Another $162 million was slashed through \"associated costs,\" the council said in a statement.\nThe approved budget also moves about $500 million of the department's capital budget to other \"badly needed infrastructure,\" the City Council said, and reduces overtime spending by $352 million.\nThe NYPD will also transfer control of the city's school safety program to the Department of Education, the council said.

Among other incidents, city officials are investigating the department after a police cruiser was filmed driving into a crowd of protesters, and an officer accused of shoving a protester to the ground and concussing her was arrested.\nCalls to defund or abolish the police have becoming a familiar demand at police brutality protests across the country. So far, just Minneapolis has pledged to look at ways to dismantle its existing police department after four officers were charged with the killing of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man whose death spurred the protests.\nCity officials aren't satisfied\nThe budget cuts and reallocations don't constitute a complete victory, officials said. City Council speaker Corey Johnson told reporters Tuesday that he wanted the cuts to go deeper.\n\"This isn't a billion dollars. And I'm not going to pretend that it is,\" Johnson said. \"To everyone who is disappointed that we did not go farther I want to let you know -- I am disappointed as well ... But this budget process involves the mayor who was not budging.\"\nThere's a growing call to defund the police. Here's what it means\nJohnson said he wanted a full hiring freeze, but this budget will still allow for two new police classes to be added. He said he also wanted a bigger headcount reduction, but this budget cuts about 1,163 officers through attribution and by eliminating two police cadet classes. The NYPD employs around 36,000 officers.\nComptroller Scott Stringer called the announced NYPD budget cuts a \"bait and switch and a paper thin excuse for reform.\"\nStringer said the \"excuses\" include proposals to slash uniformed police overtime by 60% with \"no plan on how to get there.\"\n\"Meaningful change in this moment won't come by shifting police from one agency to another, and budget tricks won't bring an end to the status quo,\" he said in a statement. \"The movement in the streets won't be suppressed by manipulated math.\"\nStringer, who certifies the budget but does not have veto power, proposed his own plan to cut $265 million from the budget, which he said was a baseline suggestion.\nNew York Public Advocate Jumaane Williams said he'd block the budget during the final tax warrant process if it didn't include a full hiring freeze for the police department. Part of the city budget did include a hiring freeze on Department of Education employees, officials said Tuesday.\nSome lawmakers believed the budget's cuts went too far.\nCouncilman Robert Holden, who voted against the budget, said he did so because of the cuts being made to the number of police officers.\n\"We've become a body politic that crafts policies from signs at protests,\" Holden said. \"Today's budget may be the final nail in the coffin for this city and its safety.\"\nPatrick Lynch, president of the New York City Police Benevolent Association, the largest NYPD police union, condemned de Blasio and City Council members for the cuts.\n\"Mayor de Blasio's message to New Yorkers today was clear: you will have fewer cops on your streets,\" Lynch said in a statement.\n\"Shootings more than doubled again last week.

Wallace drives the No. 43 car.\n\"The evidence is very clear that the noose that was in that garage had been in the garage previously,\" Phelps continued. \"The last race we had had there in October, that noose was present, and it was -- the fact that it was not found until a member of the 43 team came there is something that is a fact. We had not been back to the garage. It was a quick one-day show. The crew member went back in there. He looked and saw the noose, brought it to the attention of his crew chief, who then went to the NASCAR series director Jay Fabian, and we launched this investigation.\n\"To be clear, we would do this again. Of the evidence that we had, it was clear that we needed to look into this.\"\nPhelps did not take questions from the media on the call.\nWhy the noose is such a potent symbol of hate\nA NASCAR spokesman said on the call that while the federal investigation is finished, NASCAR's investigation continues.\nWallace wore an \"I Can't Breathe\" shirt before one event, repainted his car with the \"Black Lives Matter\" phrase and called on NASCAR to ban the Confederate flag, which the organization agreed to do June 10.\nWallace tweeted Sunday that the \"despicable act\" left him \"incredibly saddened and serves as a painful reminder of how much further we have to go as a society and how persistent we must be in the fight against racism.\"\n\"This will not break me, I will not give in nor will I back down. I will continue to proudly stand for what I believe in,\" Wallace said.\nMonday, NASCAR drivers, pit crew members and others walked alongside Wallace and escorted the No. 43 car in a show of support ahead of the race.\nCNN's Dianne Gallagher and Kevin Dotson contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/04/us/nypd-officers-attack/index.html", "headline": "Attack on NYPD officers being investigated as possible act of terrorism, source says", "published_date": "2020-06-04", "text": "(CNN)An unprovoked stabbing attack of a New York Police Department officer that ended with two other officers with gunshot wounds and a suspect in critical condition is being investigated as a possible act of terrorism, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.\nInvestigators do not believe the alleged acts are affiliated with any protests or looting seen across the city, the source said.\nThe incident began around 11:45 p.m. Wednesday, when a man \"casually\" walked up to two officers at an anti-looting post in Brooklyn, took out a knife and stabbed an officer in the neck, Shea said during a press conference, citing video surveillance of the incident.\n\"That officer was stabbed in the left side of his neck, thank God, missing an artery, and is recovering here in stable condition at the hospital,\" he told reporters early Thursday morning.\nSpat over NYC protests reignites long running feud between Cuomo and de Blasio\nAt around the same time, a uniformed sergeant and a police officer who were \"a block or two away\" heard shots fired and responded to the scene near the post at the intersection of Church and Flatbush Avenue, Shea explained.\n\"We believe that when they got there, they saw the perpetrator with a gun in his hand, which we believe belonged to one of the officers.

When it didn't happen, Austin police reformers clamored for stronger oversight of the police, and rejoiced when the city unveiled a beefed-up independent watchdog office in 2018.\nWe offer several ways to reach our journalists securely.\nCalled the Office of Police Oversight, the new city department operates independently of the police department and aims to not only hold individual officers accountable, but also make policy recommendations that focus on systemic issues, such as racial profiling. Even so, it hasn't been enough to eliminate the types of incidents that result in allegations of police brutality and racial bias.\nSince the city began revamping its oversight arm in January of 2018, Austin police have tased a Black man on his knees with his hands in the air; fatally shot an unarmed Black man in his car in a parking lot; and fired \"less-lethal\" bean-bag projectiles into the crowd at rallies honoring George Floyd -- sending a 16-year-old Latino boy and a 20-year-old Black college student to the hospital with head injuries, the latter a skull fracture.\n\"There is so much work left to do,\" said Austin City Council member Greg Casar, who is a vocal advocate of stronger police reforms. \"Policy change alone isn't going to solely do the trick. We need a culture change within policing.\"\nA protester in Austin, Texas, is detained during a rally against the death in Minneapolis police custody of George Floyd.\nIn addition to touching off a worldwide movement, the police killing of Floyd in Minneapolis has provoked a flurry of interest in police accountability, which often takes the form of police oversight agencies.\nThe day's biggest stories in 10 minutes or less.\nSign up and get access to videos and weekly student quizzes.\nSign Me Up\nNo, Thanks\nBy subscribing you agree to our\nprivacy policy.\nIn recent weeks, at least a dozen cities have reached out to the National Association for Civilian Oversight of Law Enforcement (NACOLE) to either launch some form of new oversight agency or expand on existing ones, said its director of operations, Liana Perez.\nBut at a time when \"defund the police\" has become a rallying cry for some activists, the notion of an oversight agency holds little appeal for those who want fundamental change.\nDisciplinary record of ex-officer who held Eric Garner in chokehold is finally released\nEven the strongest proponents of the civilian oversight model say it, alone, isn't enough to reform policing in America.\n\"This whole discussion is about policy and culture,\" said Robin Kniech, a City Council member in Denver, whose system of oversight has been praised as a model by experts. \"You can have a great use-of-force policy, but if you have a culture of impunity, it doesn't work.\"\nCraig Futterman, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School, said civilian police watchdogs can -- in theory -- be effective. However, he said, most of them are hamstrung by a lack or shortage of four things: independence from police departments or city hall, transparency, funding and authority.\n\"The answer to me isn't that there is something fundamentally wrong with the premise of civilian oversight,\" he said. \"The problem is, in America we still have not really tried.\"\nWatchdogs are few and their authority runs the gamut\nAbout 165 of the nation's 18,000 police departments are subject to some form of police oversight -- meaning the vast majority of law enforcement agencies across America are left to police themselves, said Perez of NACOLE.\nThey come in a dizzying constellation of formats with varying levels of authority, but in general consist of either appointed volunteers or paid non-law enforcement professionals who are tapped to police the police.\nUsually, the bodies lack the power to impose discipline directly, acting instead as advisory panels for police chiefs, internal police department investigators or city managers. Some of the bigger agencies possess the authority to conduct their own investigations.\nTheir effectiveness -- and power -- runs the gamut.\nIn Los Angeles County, it was the FBI -- not its civilian watchdog -- that was investigating allegations of abuse of jail inmates at the hands of deputies that led to a coverup and criminal convictions of the former sheriff and some of his top officials.\nWant to reform the police? Hire more women\nIn Inglewood -- a city in Los Angeles County with a high rate of violent crime -- the citizen oversight panel's meetings have been canceled each month since June 2018, according to the city website. Emails from CNN asking the committee members about this dynamic were not returned, but a 2016 story in the Los Angeles Times quotes a city official saying the commission has \"no authority\" to \"discuss or oversee or even hear any cases of [or] related to officer involved shootings.\"\nBy contrast, one of the nation's strongest civilian oversight boards is located in the northern half of California -- the Oakland Police Commission.\nThis February, in an extremely rare move, the panel of civilian appointees voted unanimously to fire without cause Oakland's police chief, who had clashed with the commission over police shootings and diversity on the force, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. Their action required mayoral approval, which was granted.\nNYPD officer suspended without pay following 'disturbing apparent chokehold incident'\nBut the commission -- which says it was founded to oversee policies in the wake of \"a sex scandal involving multiple officers with a minor\" in May 2016 -- was dinged in an audit earlier this month for failing to review the department's budget, comply with the state's open meetings law and hire an inspector general, among other things.\nIn response, police commission Chair Regina Jackson said the \"auditor's criticisms fail to account for the full span of the commission's work or the full scope of the commission's authority.\"\nTom Nolan, an associate professor at Emmanuel College in Boston, said Oakland is an outlier.\n\"It's the only city that I'm aware of where it has a police review agency that actually has the authority to terminate the chief for cause, or to recommend to the mayor that the chief be terminated without cause,\" he told CNN.\nProtesters hold banners in support of Eric Garner at Union Square on December 3, 2014, in New York City. Garner died after being put in a chokehold during an alteration with NYPD officers.\nOn the opposite coast, it was New York City's Civilian Complaint Review Board -- not the criminal courts -- that brought discipline to the officer who placed a chokehold on Eric Garner, who died after uttering the words \"I can't breathe,\" wrote the chair of the panel in a 2019 op-ed.\nAlthough no criminal charges were filed against police officer Daniel Pantaleo, the review board -- which has the power to investigate claims of wrongdoing, rather than merely review the investigations of internal affairs -- acted as the prosecutor. Its findings were presented to an administrative judge, who made the recommendation that prompted the NYPD to terminate Pantaleo without pension.\nThe watchdog agency last week released all the prior complaints made against Pantaleo after the New York legislature -- prompted by public outrage over George Floyd's death -- repealed a law that had shielded the disciplinary files of police officers from public disclosure.\nOversight not 'the panacea many expected it to be'\nResearch reveals many police watchdogs remain largely toothless.\nNACOLE recently completed a survey of civilian oversight agencies, including 54 that oversee municipal police departments, and provided the unpublished results to CNN.\nTwenty-four said they didn't have the power to issue subpoenas; for five others, their subpoena power excluded sworn officers.\nOnly two agencies, in Detroit and Chicago, said they had \"the authority to implement or impose\" new or revised police policies.\nTwenty-one agencies said the departments they oversee weren't even required to formally respond to the recommendations they made -- let alone actually make any changes.\nThere's no playbook for the battle between mayors and police right now\nAll but four of the agencies said that their access to information like use of force records, stop or search reports, body camera footage or personnel files \"depends on the cooperation\" of the police department they oversee.\n\"Civilian oversight has not proven to be 'the panacea many expected it to be,'\" wrote Stephen Rushin, a police accountability expert at Loyola University, in a 2017 report for Duke Law School.\nCivilian oversight agencies have also been weakened by police unions.\nIn New Jersey last year, the Newark Fraternal Order of Police won a lawsuit that pulled the fangs out of a civilian review board, stripping it of its subpoena power to investigate complaints against police. The board won an appeal and the matter now is before the state Supreme Court, according to a recent report in the Center for Public Integrity.\nAlso in 2018, in Tennessee, the Nashville Fraternal Order of Police spent $500,000 on TV ads and other campaign activities calling on voters to oppose a charter amendment to form an oversight panel -- a proposal prompted in part by the police killing of two Black men by White officers, according to the Tennessean. Despite the union's efforts, the initiative prevailed.\nWhat could make oversight more effective?\nIn recent years, the civilian board model has been losing ground to an emerging model of oversight that now makes up about a quarter of the nation's oversight agencies, Perez said.\nThese are often referred to as \"auditing\" or \"monitoring\" agencies, and they are composed of paid staff -- not appointed volunteers, Perez said. Many of the staffers are \"monitors\" who are lawyers by trade and report to the city manager.\nThe idea is to set expectations for officers on the front end, to better avoid disasters on the back end.\n\"Back ends don't work without good front ends,\" said Barry Friedman, a law professor and director of the Policing Project at New York University School of Law. \"Policing desperately needs a front end.\"\nTo that point, Denver has emerged as a model for effective police oversight.\nDenver Police advance after firing tear gas canisters during a protest outside the State Capitol over the death of George Floyd, on May 30.\nDenver's Office of the Independent Monitor is a city department with 15 employees -- led by mayoral appointee Nicholas Mitchell -- who weigh in on \"back end\" discipline cases and \"front end\" matters of policy. In late 2013, Mitchell, who like many of his employees is an attorney, uncovered a large backlog of civilian complaints in the sheriff's department that included accusations by jail inmates that they'd been physically, sexually or verbally abused by deputies.\nKniech, the Denver City Council member, said this led to a series of reviews that culminated with a major structural change: removing the sheriff's internal review arm and reestablishing it as an independent entity.\n\"Internal affairs are no longer internal,\" said Kniech.\nColorado governor signs bill mandating police body cameras and banning chokeholds\nThe union representing sheriff's deputies told the Denver Post they believed the new division would just add unnecessary layers of bureaucracy.\n\"We're just very disappointed in how this is going,\" Mike Jackson, president of the union, told the newspaper.\nDenver's robust watchdog apparatus hasn't been enough to change some of the more deeply rooted problems.\n\"We have not overcome the institutionalized racism that lives in individual officers and in the system,\" Kniech said.\nPolice unions stand in the way of lasting reform\nKniech cited the 2015 case of Jessica \"Jessie\" Hernandez, age 17, who was sleeping in a car that was suspected stolen with four other teens. When police arrived and got out of their cars to talk to the teens, Hernandez, who was behind the wheel, started driving away. Officers fired four shots into the driver's side window of the car, killing Hernandez.\n\"Rather than jumping out of the way of the car, the officer shot into the car\" and killed Hernandez, she said.\nThe officers involved with the incident were cleared of criminal wrongdoing by the DA; the officer who shot into the car said he feared for his safety.\nHernandez's parents later sued the city, which paid the family $1 million in a settlement.\nDespite improvements, there's still more work to do in Austin\nAustin city officials boast that their new office of oversight is the strongest in Texas. But while it, like Denver, uses the monitoring and auditing approach, unlike Denver, Austin's office lacks subpoena power.\nIt has, however, been credited for its transparency.\nWhy some police officers rally around their colleagues -- even when they're accused of committing crimes\nNew rules enable citizens to file complaints anonymously and easily -- by a phone call, for instance. Each complaint is prominently posted online, with the accused officer's name redacted.\nComplaints have skyrocketed. The George Floyd protest alone, in which Austin police fired \"less-lethal\" beanbag rounds into the crowd, generated more than 200, according to Farah Muscadin, head of Austin's police oversight agency.\nAustin Police Chief Brian Manley said in a Twitter post that officers on one occasion fired into the crowd after a demonstrator hurled a water bottle and bag at the police. He acknowledged that police accidentally hit another man, Justin Howell, a 20-year-old college student who suffered a skull fracture when a beanbag projectile hit the back of his head.\nChas Moore, a local activist who spearheaded the drive for revamping the oversight office, said the resulting reform, to date, has been \"very, very, very incremental.\"\n\"The APD has a very long way of going before they begin to regain trust in the communities that they harm the most, which is Black and other communities of color,\" he said.\nIn December, Austin City Council voted unanimously to conduct an audit of the department for racism and bigotry.\nCalls are growing to defund police in the US. Here are some lessons from overseas\nChief Manley, who did not respond to a CNN request for comment, has defended the department against such accusations.\nEarlier this month, the City Council grilled him about whether the police response to the Floyd protest is a sign the department is in need of \"institutional reform,\" with one member pointing out that the police didn't fire \"less lethal\" munitions on people protesting the coronavirus shutdown.\n\"I don't believe that the occurrences of this weekend should lead people to believe automatically that there's a culture problem,\" he said, according to the local NPR affiliate.\nTo date, few of the complaints involving excessive use-of-force allegations have resulted in disciplinary action since the oversight office's official launch in late 2018, said Muscadin, adding that she and the policing community typically don't see eye-to-eye on use-of-force matters.\nSenate Democrats block GOP police reform bill, throwing overhaul effort into flux\n\"We will watch the same video and see two different things,\" said Muscadin, an attorney who, prior to relocating to Austin from Chicago for the position, worked as an assistant public defender for the Cook County Public Defender's Office.\nThe office also released a racial profiling report showing that Austin police disproportionately pull over black motorists, who make up 8% of the population but constitute 15% of the stops. Muscadin has recommended a racial-profiling policy for the department, as well as a mandatory class on the history of race and policing.\nAustin's most high-profile open case involves the fatal police shooting in April of Michael Ramos, an unarmed Black man.\nThe oversight office and the police department are squabbling over how to release the body-cam footage, which shows Ramos getting back into his car in a parking lot of his apartment complex after being shot with a beanbag round. When he pulls the car forward, an officer fires live rounds into it, killing Ramos. The officer believed the vehicle at that point was a weapon, police said.\nIn late May -- a few days after Floyd's death -- the district attorney announced that she would present the Ramos case to a grand jury.\nLast summer, the same officer who killed Ramos -- Christopher Taylor -- was one of the officers involved in the fatal shooting of 46-year-old Mauris DeSilva, who had reportedly been holding a knife to his own throat in his apartment building. Police said DeSilva was experiencing a mental health crisis, and that he walked toward officers while still clutching the knife.\nThe case touched off an internal investigation, but nearly one year after the incident, all the evidence -- including the body-cam footage -- remains sealed from the public amid a civil lawsuit pitting DeSilva's family against the city. (A police spokesperson told CNN the state attorney general has ordered the city to withhold the evidence pending the outcome of the district attorney's review of the case.)\nKen Casaday, president of the Austin Police Association, said Taylor and the other officer \"followed their training\" with respect to the DeSilva case.\n\"That's all we expect,\" he told CNN, saying he is withholding judgment in Ramos case because the investigation is ongoing.\nMeanwhile, Ramos's mother, Brenda Ramos, who has demanded that the officer who killed her son be held accountable, continues to wait.\n\"I just miss him so much,\" she said in a phone interview. \"I'm hurting more and more, because that officer is working on the street after what he's done.\""}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/19/us/breonna-taylor-shooting-officer-firing/index.html", "headline": "Louisville seeks to fire police officer in shooting of Breonna Taylor", "published_date": "2020-06-19", "text": "(CNN)The city of Louisville, Kentucky, and its police department are taking the first steps toward firing an officer involved in the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor last March.\nMayor Greg Fischer has initiated termination proceedings against Louisville Metro Police Det.

Police body-cam footage and eyewitness cell phone video show some of the interaction between the officers and the teens.\nIn a video shot by a bystander, one of the officers is seen leaning into his police car where he had placed one of the handcuffed teens. After a few seconds, the officer is seen kicking into the car. Moments later, that officer throws the handcuffed teen out of the car and onto the sidewalk.\nIn police dash camera video released by the Tulsa Police Department, an officer can be seen searching the pocket of the teen who had been put in the front seat of the police car. A few minutes later, the officer can be seen kicking his legs as the teen struggles.\nAlthough the boys were eventually released, and the Tulsa Police Department announced an investigation, the lasting emotional trauma of incidents like this one often runs deeper than some realize, Robinson says.\nThese Tulsa natives are following in the footsteps of the Black Panther movement\n\"A white boy wakes up and says, 'What do I want to do today?'

agents or projectiles against peaceful protesters without supervisor approval", "published_date": "2020-06-06", "text": "(CNN)Calling the Denver Police Department's efforts to \"police its own\" a failure, a US District Court Judge granted a temporary restraining order late Friday evening prohibiting the use of \"chemical weapons or projectiles of any kind against persons engaging in peaceful protests or demonstrations.\"\nThe temporary restraining order (TRO) granted by Judge R. Brooke Jackson applies to the City and County of Denver, and specifically the Denver Police Department and those assisting the department.\nThe ruling came after four Denver residents who participated in demonstrations following the death of George Floyd, filed a complaint Thursday challenging the Denver Police Department's use of chemical agents and rubber projectiles during protests.\nThe plaintiff's allege in some cases the Denver Police Department \"violated their First Amendment right to free speech and their Fourth Amendment right against excessive force by using pepper spray, pepper balls, rubber bullets, flashbang grenades, and tear gas to punish plaintiffs for demonstrating against police brutality.\"\n\"In issuing this relief I do not seek to prevent officers from protecting themselves or their community,\" Jackson said in the ruling. \"I seek to balance citizens' constitutional rights against officers' ability to do their job. However, the time is past to rely solely on the good faith and discretion of the Denver Police Department and its colleagues from other jurisdictions.\"\nRestrictions on use of projectiles and chemicals\nUnder the temporary restraining order, only on-scene supervisors holding the rank of Captain or above are allowed to authorize the use of non-lethal projectiles and chemical agents such as tear gas and pepper spray after personally witnessing \"specific acts of violence or destruction of property.\"\nJackson also included additional stipulations for the use of the non-lethal projectiles and the chemical agents by officers. They include:\n\u2022 Kinetic Impact Projectiles (\"KIPs\") and all other non- or less-lethal projectiles may never be discharged to target the head, pelvis, or back.\n\u2022 KIPs and all other non- or less-lethal projectiles shall not be shot indiscriminately into a crowd.\n\u2022 Non-Denver officers can not use any demonstration of force or weapon beyond what Denver itself authorizes for its own officers. Any non-Denver officer permitted to or directed to be deployed to the demonstrations shall be considered an agent of Denver and the city can ensure the officer is limiting their use of force to that which is authorized.\n\u2022 All officers deployed to demonstrations must have their body-worn cameras recording at all times, and they may not intentionally obstruct the camera or recording.\n\u2022 Chemical agents or irritants (including pepper spray and tear gas) may only be used after an order to disperse is issued.\n\u2022 Any and all orders to disperse must be followed with adequate time for the intended audience to comply, and officers must leave room for safe egress. If it appears that the intended audience was unable to hear the order, the order must be repeated prior to the use of chemical agents or irritants.\nRequest for modifications\nFollowing the ruling, the Denver Police Department said in posts on Twitter that it would comply with the order, but is asking the judge for some modifications.\n\"A federal judge issued a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) clarifying #DPD use of non-lethal dispersant devices. In the meantime, we will comply with the judge's directions, many of which are already in line with our community-consulted Use of Force Policy,\" the post said. \"We are asking for modifications to the Order that would account for limitations on staffing and body-worn cameras so the directions can be operationalized.\"\nOn Friday night, the city and county of Denver filed an emergency motion for modification of the temporary restraining order.\nThe motion asked the court to allow officers at the rank of lieutenant to authorize the deployment of chemical agents or projectiles in response to specific acts of violence or destruction of property because of limitations in staffing.\n\"This is not feasible under the command structure of the Denver Police Department because currently there are only four police officers with the rank of Captain and one Commander responsible for the downtown area,\" the motion said.\nThe motion also requested to eliminate the requirement regarding the body cameras, claiming the order would prevent the department from receiving assistance from other agencies that do not have body cameras. The city also cited technical limitations of the body cameras as another reason for eliminating the requirement."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/27/us/us-blm-protests/index.html", "headline": "Peaceful protests and violent clashes erupted this weekend.

Some demonstrators allegedly threw water bottles at police. Charges include assault and disorderly conduct, Chavous said.\nOn Saturday, a Black group calling itself the Not F**king Around Coalition gathered in Louisville to call for justice in Taylor's case, according to CNN affiliate WAVE.

Coronavirus\nWhile other countries like the UK, India, France, the Czech Republic, Cuba, Pakistan and Iran have some form of federal mask mandate in place, that debate is still raging in the US. Sen. Elizabeth Warren has asked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to use its authority to implement and expand mask requirements, and possibly intervene in situations like the one unfolding in Georgia, where Gov. Brian Kemp has banned local mask mandates. US case numbers are creeping toward the 4 million mark, and hospitalization rates are nearing April's peak. California has also surpassed New York as the state with the most confirmed coronavirus cases. Around the world, Argentina saw new record numbers of cases and deaths, and Mexico has now reported more than 40,000 fatalities due to the disease.

Stimulus\nAfter a full day of negotiations, the White House and Senate Republicans are no closer to an agreement on the next stimulus bill. During a closed-door lunch, some Republicans railed against President Donald Trump's desire for a payroll tax cut, and it seems other party members are against the idea of another stimulus bill altogether. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says Republicans will still release their proposal this week, and it will likely include $105 billion in funding to help reopen schools across the country, as well as another round of direct payments to Americans. But he'll have opposition in his own ranks. Sen. Ted Cruz was clear on where he stands on it: \"As it's written right now, I'm not only a no, I'm a hell no.\" A reminder: There's less than three weeks to get a deal done before the August recess, and before current unemployment enhancements run out.\nCruz on GOP proposal: I'm not only a no, I'm a hell no 01:03\n3. Protests\nNearly two months after the death of George Floyd sparked worldwide protests, unrest continues to simmer in parts of the country, leading to even more efforts to regulate police and federal use of force. In Portland, Oregon, where ongoing unrest has taken over parts of the city, there have been 43 federal arrests since July 4. The federal presence there has come under increased scrutiny by local officials and lawmakers who have urged the Trump administration to pull back. The state's two Democratic senators are even pushing legislation that aims to scale back the use of federal law enforcement agents against protesters and prevent agents from making arrests without displaying clear identification. Meanwhile, the Senate has voted overwhelmingly to put some limits on the transfer of military equipment from the Defense Department to state and local police departments under the National Defense Authorization Act.\nMoms try to protect protestors in Portland 00:47\n4. China\nThe US has charged two alleged Chinese hackers over a \"sweeping global computer intrusion campaign\" aimed at coronavirus treatment and vaccine research. And, US prosecutors say, the effort was backed by the Chinese government. These are the first criminal charges against foreign hackers going after coronavirus research, but the hackers' efforts didn't stop there: They have also allegedly targeted dissidents and human rights activists in the US, China and Hong Kong, as well as hundreds of international businesses. The pair are also accused of stealing information about US military satellite programs and high-powered systems from defense contractors, among other defense technology.\n5. Social media\nTwitter has taken down more than 7,000 accounts related to QAnon, a group that pushes several baseless conspiracy theories and is known to spread disinformation online. The social media titan says there's more action to come that will limit the influence of the roughly 150,000 accounts worldwide that are tied to the QAnon movement. Meanwhile, Facebook has started enacting a new policy of labeling posts from President Donald Trump and presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden about the November election. However, critics note that the labels don't actually fact check or provide information about the posts themselves. They simply link to a government website about how to vote, which some say could be seen as a tacit endorsement of whatever the post promotes.\nWhat is QAnon?

If we go back to the Goya example, it's Latinos, who are pushing back against a CEO's flattery of a President who's spent his time in office disparaging Latino communities in a racist manner. With Rowling, it's transgender communities and their allies, who are rebuking someone who's trafficking in harmful, essentialist notions of gender.\nL: Exactly! This idea of canceling someone is so vague. Like, remember when Shane Gillis, who was almost on \"Saturday Night Live,\" was fired for his racist jokes? So many people were all \"cancel culture strikes again,\" rather than actually grappling with the fact that Gillis was merely being held accountable for his actions. These situations always get labeled as \"angry internet mobs go after a celebrity,\" as if the celebrity did nothing wrong.\nB: A friend put it to me like this: \"Tell me your views on cancel culture, and I'll tell you who you are.\"\nIn short: power\nThe mass reckoning playing out across the country -- on university campuses, in newsrooms, on streets -- is about one thing: power. That makes sense, given that America was founded on extending control to a few while withholding it from the rest.\nOr in short: \"everything unsettling that is happening right now, in this moment -- perhaps, in yet another letter you've read -- is about power. who has it, who wants it, how its wielded, and what it means to challenge and upend that,\" as New York Times Magazine writer Jenna Wortham recently tweeted.\nThe historical context\nEartha Kitt and the Johnson administration\nCancel culture: What a hazy term!\nIts critics often conflate First Amendment-enshrined free speech with immunity from disagreement, including on social media. There's a dizzying amount of irony here: The people with healthy platforms -- columns at magazines, lucrative book deals, the White House -- are the ones who often believe that free speech is under siege. Meanwhile, the supposed cancelers are people who, until recently, had very little opportunity to meaningfully shape national conversations.\nHistory offers us an example of what being suppressed actually looks like -- and it's far worse than the sting of Twitter rage. In January 1968, the singer, actor, and activist Eartha Kitt attended a White House luncheon on juvenile crime. (She went reluctantly, according to her autobiography, because she \"felt a con coming on.\") When it was her turn to speak, she excoriated Lyndon B. Johnson's administration and America's involvement in the Vietnam War.\n\"You send the best of this country off to be shot and maimed. They rebel in the street. They will take pot ... and they will get high. They don't want to go to school because they're going to be snatched off from their mothers to be shot in Vietnam,\" Kitt said. \"Because there is a war on and I pray that there will be a just and honest peace -- that still doesn't give us a free ticket not to try to work for better things such as against crime in the streets, for better education and better health for our people.\"\nAfter that event, Kitt's career cratered. According to a 1978 New York Times article, \"the Central Intelligence Agency, asked by the Secret Service in 1968 about Eartha Kitt, produced an extensive report containing secondhand gossip about the entertainer but no evidence of any foreign intelligence connections.\"\nUnable to find employment in America, she worked for several years in Europe.\nIn all that is a lesson about proportion. Cancel culture's detractors may not like suddenly having to engage with historically marginalized groups -- but true, government-sanctioned suppression of free speech and diverging opinions is happening all around them, and has been for a long time.\nRecommended for your eyes and ears\nIs there anything that wouldn't benefit from Viola Davis' presence?\nVanity Fair's latest edition is yet more proof that the answer is no. The photos are stunning: commanding, incandescent.\nBut also fascinating is the history behind the photos: This was the first time a Black photographer, Dario Calmese, shot the cover of the magazine.\nThe photos highlight the importance of telling your own history: Calmese said that his goal was to subvert \"the White gaze on Black bodies, and (transmute) that into something of elegance and beauty and power.\"\nHis work is a world apart from Annie Leibovitz's photos of Simone Biles for Vogue. This difference illustrates that there's still a long way to go in terms of addressing the racial bias of photography.\n\"The Old Guard\" takes the traditional superhero film and turns it on its head. In a genre steeped in both Whiteness and the male gaze (hello, \"Catwoman\"), this Netflix blockbuster, directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood, a Black woman, feels like an action film for everyone else.\nShe takes the backgrounds of Black and gay characters and elevates them in a way that's sweet and focused but not contrived.\nIt just goes to show you how much power White people have had for so long, and it illuminates what other stories we can tell when other people are behind the camera.\nAs many in America begin to have difficult conversations on race, similar questions are being raised in other countries in light of the protests here.\nJust look at France, a country that prides itself on its assimilation narrative.\nThe New York Times explored the cultural shift happening there among first- and second-generation immigrants -- and how this shift could shake up the very essence of French society.\nAround the office\nWhy Black Christians are bracing for a 'whitelash'\nDaniel Burke, CNN's religion reporter, wrote about how Black Christians are bracing for \"whitelash\" -- the moment when White Christians tire of continuing the conversation on race after the death of George Floyd, and once again begin to bristle at such topics.\nHe writes: \"White Christian leaders have prayed at vigils and marched in protests, damned the officers accused of killing Floyd and recited the slogan Black Lives Matter, often while distancing themselves from the organization of the same name. One evangelical magazine, Christianity Today, called for a church-led reparations project. But even as they appreciate the scales falling from some White Christians' eyes, some Black Christians remain wary.\""}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/06/us/police-reports-lying-videos-misconduct-trnd/index.html", "headline": "Videos often contradict what police say in reports. Here's why some officers continue to lie", "published_date": "2020-06-06", "text": "(CNN)A video showed officers in Buffalo, New York, pushing a 75-year-old man. Police initially said he had tripped and fell.\nBuffalo officers quit special team after 2 officers suspended for allegedly shoving 75-year-old to ground\nNews cameras showed officers in Atlanta breaking the windows of a vehicle, pulling a woman out of the car and tasing a man. In his report, an officer wrote he wasn't sure the pair was armed.

But videos from several recent incidents, and countless others from over the years, have shown what many black Americans have long maintained: that police officers lie.\nHere's why experts say some police officers falsify reports and statements, and why the problem persists.\nWhat prompts it\nIt's fairly common for officers to lie in police reports, said Philip Stinson, a criminologist and professor of criminal justice at Bowling Green State University.\nThe day's biggest stories in 10 minutes or less.\nSign up and get access to videos and weekly student quizzes.\nSign Me Up\nNo, Thanks\nBy subscribing you agree to our\nprivacy policy.\nStinson has tracked arrest cases of nonfederal sworn law enforcement officers who have been charged with at least one crime from 2005 to 2014. His research shows that out of more than 10,000 officer arrest cases, about 6.3% involved false reports or statements. About a quarter of those cases involving false reports or statements also involved alleged acts of police violence -- and he said the problem is probably more common than the data suggests.\nVideo captures Buffalo police push elderly man to the ground 01:46\nSo why do officers lie in police statements?\n\nSelf-preservation: One of the reasons is simple: to avoid the consequences.\nThat's according to David Thomas, a professor of forensic studies and criminal justice at Florida Gulf Coast University and a retired police officer.\nWhen officers misrepresent incidents in police reports, it is often to justify the use of excessive force or an unlawful arrest, he said. The officer knows that they have made a mistake and are trying to avoid losing their job, criminal charges or other disciplinary actions.\n\"Your motivation to lie, really, is to keep your job and hope that nobody finds out,\" Thomas said.\nTo justify an action: Another reason is what's known as \"noble cause corruption,\" said Philip Stinson, a criminologist and professor of criminal justice at Bowling Green State University.\nOfficers might lie in police reports to justify an action they took, whether the use of force or a questionable arrest. Police are often operating under the mindset that they are keeping communities safe or getting criminals off the streets. So when they lie, the idea is that the ends justify the means -- that their actions were ultimately for a good cause.\nHow we can start systemically reforming the police\n\"It's an ingrained part of the police subculture in many communities across the country,\" Stinson said.\nEven if there is video of the incident showing otherwise, many officers believe that their word will mean more than the tape, Thomas said.\nA common argument that officers make when a video shows them acting in questionable ways is that the public often doesn't see what happened at the beginning, he said. So some officers will tell a story that justifies what viewers saw in the recording.\nWhat perpetuates it\nTime and time again, videos have surfaced that have contradicted what police said in their initial statements.\nIn the case of 15-year-old Jordan Edwards, who was shot by officer Roy Oliver as he was leaving a party, the Balch Springs police initially said that the car Edwards was in was moving aggressively toward officers before Oliver fired into it.\nThe body camera told a different story, showing that the car was moving in the opposite direction.\nThey are often not held accountable: Roy Oliver was ultimately convicted of murder and sentenced to 15 years in prison -- but such convictions are rare.\nAtlanta police officer body slamming woman caught on camera 03:13\nThat's one of the reasons that some police officers lie in reports, despite the possibility of video counteracting their claims, says Rachel Moran, an assistant professor at the University of St. Thomas School of Law.\nSometimes, the video is never made public. And even when it is, officers are often not held accountable.\n\"There's so many lies being caught on video or this behavior that the police then tell a totally different story about,\" Moran said. \"There's a lot of police officers lying who we're just not going to find out about. And then the ones who are, it doesn't mean just because there's brief political outrage that they're going to get held accountable.\"\nThe investigative process tends to favor officers: Moran, whose research focuses on police accountability, said that the complaint process for someone who feels they have been mistreated by an officer can be highly bureaucratic. It also tends to favor the officer, she said.\nThree videos piece together the final moments of George Floyd's life\nMost police departments around the country handle officer misconduct complaints through an internal affairs unit within the department. That means police are generally investigating their own colleagues, and deciding what punishment, if any, to impose.\n\"There's a strong culture of protecting each other,\" Moran said. \"Sometimes there's also strong bias often against people making the complaints. Class and race bias come heavily into play there. So here's often a presumption, whether intentional or not, that the people making the complaints are probably at fault.\"\nDiscipline is often minimal: Even when discipline is imposed, Moran says, it often isn't meaningful.\nDerek Chauvin, the Minneapolis police officer who pressed his knee into George Floyd's neck, was the subject of at least 18 prior complaints, according to a department internal affairs public summary. Only two were \"closed with discipline.\"\nBut it's not just an accountability issue, says Stephen Rushin, an associate professor of law at Loyola University Chicago.\nA police officer wearing a body cam is seen during a demonstration in Atlanta on May 31.\nOfficers are often protected from repercussions: In some jurisdictions, there are systems in place that protect officers from repercussions, Rushin said.\nIn an article for The George Washington Law Review, Rushin and Atticus DeProspo analyzed 657 police union contracts and 20 law enforcement officer bills of rights, which govern internal disciplinary procedures for many police officers in the US.\nThey found that \"while many of these jurisdictions have reasonable regulations in place to prevent coercive or abusive tactics, a significant number of departments provide officers with interrogation protections that may frustrate accountability efforts.\"\nAs rage over killings of black Americans sweeps nation, DOJ has all but abandoned broad police investigations\nAbout 20% of the agencies they analyzed stipulated a waiting period for officers before they are interrogated about suspected misconduct. And about 28% of agencies required internal investigators to turn over potentially incriminating evidence to officers before they may be questioned.\n\"In agencies that provide rigid waiting periods and agencies that provide officers access to video evidence and other incriminating evidence against them in internal investigations, officers know they're going to have a period of time to get their story straight, to come up with a story that's consistent with the evidence against them to avoid accountability,\" Rushin said.\nWhat might prevent it\nPreventing officers from lying in police reports and statements is an extremely complex issue.\nVideo evidence: The use of surveillance cameras, smartphones and body cameras to generate evidence in incidents of potential police misconduct has become much more widespread in recent years. And in many incidents, it was the video footage that led to criminal charges -- and sometimes convictions.\nEx-police chief: What's the plan now, America?\nBut rules often vary on whether officers are required to turn on body cameras, whether the videos must be reviewed before writing incident reports and whether are released publicly. And studies on their effectiveness have yielded mixed results.\nChanging the culture: Another piece of it is changing systemic police culture, said Thomas. Police chiefs need to set standards and better train officers around use of force, deescalation and report falsification, and hold officers accountable when they violate those standards.\n\"Systematically, the culture has to change or we will continue to have these problems,\" he said.\nEnding in-house investigations: One particular reform that's often proposed around police accountability is removing internal affairs units from review processes, and empowering civilian review agencies, which are generally composed by members of the public, Moran said. But even when cities have civilian review boards, they tend to be weak, she said.\nThomas also pointed to the power of police unions, who play a significant role in protecting officers from accountability and often block efforts by departments to reform agencies.\nThere are no easy answers, the experts said.\nBut, they say, with so many instances of video evidence discrediting the initial police account, demanding them is long overdue."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/23/us/atlanta-spotlight-brooks-funeral/index.html", "headline": "Atlanta is once again at the center of the nation's struggle with race and civil rights", "published_date": "2020-06-23", "text": "Atlanta (CNN)The home of Martin Luther King Jr., capital of the New South and \"the city too busy to hate\" is again in the spotlight of protest and change related to the country's race relations, from Black Lives Matter to the presidential election.\nRecent violence will lead to grieving in a historic location Tuesday in Atlanta.

Less than three months later, she passed.\n\"Being in the hospital and not being able to be herself and not being able to fight, that's crazy,\" Ashley Carr said. \"It's a lot of emotions that come back up, but through all of these emotions, we all have to still get up and go do jobs.

She has no choice but to persevere.\n\"People ask all the time, 'How do you do it? How do you smile through it all?' It's life, you know? You have to keep living,\" she said. \"I have my moments where I might not sleep for days or I might be in the car and I just start crying. You just have your moments.\"\nLike anyone, there are times when the siblings want to block out the world and forget their woes, but it isn't realistic. They must fight for justice. They must keep their sister's name alive, to ensure people understand she lived for something and died for nothing.\n\"Some days, you do want to just crawl up under a rock and pray that this all goes away. You think you're living in a nightmare, but this is life. This is our new normal, as they call it.

He left home about 12 years ago and now serves as a boatswain's mate in the US Navy. Military obligations prevent him from being as involved as his sisters in activism.\nOne of the family initiatives of which he's proudest is the Atatiana Project, which serves to bridge police and urban communities, and promotes STEM careers -- with an emphasis on coding and gaming -- for children. Jefferson, a biology graduate from Xavier University of Louisiana, worked in pharmaceutical equipment sales and wanted to become a doctor.\nThe Atatiana Project launched on Juneteenth.\nVictim's brother: I'm speechless about this 02:05\nAdarius, 32, loved playing video games with his little sister. Role-playing, fighting games -- nothing was off limits. As kids, they'd play all night and be bushed when it came time to go to school, he said. The memory brings a bright smile to his face.\nThe last time the Navy chief petty officer came home from deployment, he and Jefferson played Warframe for four days -- \"all night giggling, laughing, telling jokes. She's always a class act, always had me in stitches.\"\nToday, he keeps his sister's pillow in his gaming room in San Diego, where he's stationed. He catches himself asking her questions about the games he's playing.\n\"Giving back is a big thing for us in general,\" he said of the Atatiana Project. \"When you're hurting, it is sometimes better to just get people around you that understand the hurt, or you can help them with their hurt. We've been through a lot, and we want to see if we can help the next person.\"\nAmber and Ashley Carr have found solace in another initiative, Sisters of the Movement, an organization founded by women who lost siblings to police violence, including Sandra Bland's, Terence Crutcher's and Shantel Davis'.\nAnother founder, Allisa Charles-Findley, the sister of Botham Jean -- who, too, was killed in his own home by a Texas police officer -- helped Ashley Carr navigate losing a sibling and \"the different things that go on with family dynamics,\" Carr said.\nBotham Jean and Atatiana Jefferson were both killed by police in their homes.\n\"We end up realizing we are part of a movement and we need to be heard and that we do matter -- and that the people, they needed a voice and we want to be the voice,\" Ashley Carr said. \"That helped me show that I'm OK. ... These are valid feelings to be feeling angry, to be feeling upset, to be feeling like, How in the world could this happen to somebody who was just literally at home?\"\nAmber Carr texts with Botham Jean's mother, Allison, periodically. She's hilarious and \"a breath of fresh air,\" Carr said. Taking Zion and Zayden to visit her in St. Lucia is on Amber Carr's \"vision board\" for the future, she said.\n\"Those women, they're relatable,\" she said. \"That part helps me, to know I'm not by myself.\"\nWaiting for justice\nAs the A-Team grapples with grief and justice, former Fort Worth police officer Aaron Dean awaits trial on a murder charge.\nYolanda Carr sobbed from her hospital bed upon learning Dean was indicted in December, but she died weeks later.\nVictim's brother gets emotional, demands cop's arrest 02:10\nDean had tendered his resignation and has been free on $200,000 bail. The state police union will help pay for his defense. Dean's attorney, Jim Lane, declined to comment, citing the court's gag order, but told CNN last year, \"My client is sorry and his family is in shock.\"\nJefferson's siblings don't know much about the case. No one has given them a timeline. When Amber Carr last spoke to prosecutors, she said, she was told there are other cases ahead of theirs.\n\"We just have to wait our turn,\" Carr said. Because of Covid-19, the state has placed trials on hold until at least September 1, and no information on Dean's trial or next hearing is available, said Sam Jordan, spokeswoman for the Tarrant County district attorney's office.\nThe question the siblings keep asking: Why is this dragging out? It's so clear-cut, so egregious in their minds, it should be open-and-shut, they say. Where's the accountability?\nOfficer charged with murder after killing woman in her home 01:54\nAshley Carr, a former educator, is a budget analyst for Houston schools. If she were to hurt or upset a child, there'd be questions to answer. Amber Carr is a cosmetologist. If she were accused of cutting a client or being unsanitary, Texas might pull her license. Adarius Carr is a sailor. Every time he pulls the trigger, he has to answer to someone. They feel they're held to stiffer standards than police, they say.\n\"Rules of engagement is big in the military, and I don't see how my rules of engagement are a lot stricter than theirs,\" Adarius Carr said. \"They defend us, so it baffles me.\"\nMemories buoy siblings\nUntil they get answers, they'll keep championing Jefferson's legacy. They find warmth in the memories of their beautiful, smiling sister who would do anything for them.\nAshley and Amber will remember when they flew out to San Diego to see Adarius and saw The O'Jays at the 2018 county fair. Video from the concert shows them laughing and dancing and having a ball.\nJefferson loved her tunes -- all genres, from gospel to metal -- and was a talented musician, earning first chair for clarinets at every school she attended, the siblings said.\nAtatiana, Adarius and Amber Carr pose with \"sister-cousin\" Cerese Fortson In San Diego in 2018.\nAshley Carr will always think fondly of the last show they saw together: Beyonce and Jay-Z during the 2018 On the Run II Tour -- in Beyonce's and Ashley's hometown of Houston, no less. Jefferson had never been to a concert of that scale, her sister said, and Ashley didn't realize Jefferson was such an enthusiastic member of the Beyhive until that day. They had such fun, Ashley looked forward to more shows with her sister.\n\"I was like, 'Man, we're doing this all the time.' In my head, I was like, 'This is going to be my new concert buddy,'\" she said. \"When I listen to Beyonce, I always think of her. I always say, 'We had our moment.' We did have our moment, and I'm going to cherish that moment.\""}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/28/us/portland-protests-wall-of-moms-lawsuit/index.html", "headline": "'Wall of Moms' sues federal agencies over Portland protest violence", "published_date": "2020-07-28", "text": "(CNN)Two protest groups are suing federal law enforcement agencies over their response to demonstrations in support of Black Lives Matter in downtown Portland.\nThe suit, filed Monday by Wall of Moms, Don't Shoot Portland and a number of individuals, alleges that federal agents have used violence to \"stamp out peaceful and constitutionally protected protests\" and that their mere presence as a federal domestic security force is unconstitutional.\nThis month, President Donald Trump sent federal agents to Portland as protests continue after the death of George Floyd in police custody.\nThe suit alleges that federal agents -- some of whom \"are not trained to police mass protests protected by the first amendment\" -- have been used to quell demonstrations and \"betray a foundational principle of American Democracy.\"\nPeaceful protests and violent clashes erupted this weekend.

The city's history of protest takes an exceptional turn\nIn a Monday night tweet, Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler called for an immediate meeting with DHS leadership \"to discuss a cease-fire and the removal of heightened federal forces.\"\nLast week, a unanimous Portland City Council voted to end cooperation between the Portland Police Bureau and federal agencies.\nWheeler has come under intense scrutiny by Trump and acting DHS secretary Chad Wolf after weeks of protests in his city.\nAhead of the July Fourth weekend, the Trump administration dispatched teams of federal agents to the city -- the President said the effort was to protect federal property but protesters say the action itself has fueled the public's outrage.\nFor several nights, largely peaceful protests demanding racial justice and an end to an influx in federal resources in the city, have turned violent as a small subset of rioters have set fires and launched fireworks at the city's downtown federal courthouse. The issue has led Portland city officials and members of the Trump administration to engage in a public war of words over who is to blame for the actions of rioters.\nWheeler was asked whether he is in contact with the acting DHS secretary Wednesday.\n\"I have no reason to reach him,\" Wheeler said at the time. \"My demands are clear. I want them to leave.\"\nBut Acting Secretary for Homeland Security Chad Wolf told Fox News that he blames city leadership for fostering an environment that allows criminals to be untouched.\n\"They're coming armed with rocks, bottles, baseball bats, power tools, commercial grade fireworks, eliciting that violence and targeting their violence on federal courthouses and federal law enforcement officers,\" Wolf said of Portland.\n\"I offered DHS support to help locally address the situation that's going on in Portland, and their only response was: please pack up and go home,\" Wolf said in an interview with Fox News. \"That's just not going to happen on my watch.\"\nFederal officers make 22 arrests since Thursday\nThe US Attorney's Office says officers protecting the federal courthouse in Portland \"have been subjected to nightly threats and assaults from demonstrators while performing their duties.\"\n18 people face federal charges after arrests at courthouse protests in Portland\nCrowds of several hundred people gathered outside the federal courthouse Sunday and \"spent hours yelling, chanting, banging on the fence and throwing objects over it,\" according to a statement released by the Portland Police Bureau early Monday morning.\nFederal officers have arrested 22 people in Portland since Thursday night, according to a press release for the Department of Justice.\nMost of the people arrested have been charged with assaulting a federal officer, but one suspect is accused of illegal operation of a drone. Another is accused of \"stalking federal employees\" by allegedly doxing members of the Federal Protective Service, which involves researching and publicly broadcasting private information of an individual.\nMany protesters and local leaders have said that the presence of federal forces in the city have heightened tensions between protesters and law enforcement.\nCNN's Andy Rose and Jon Passantino contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/07/us/professor-controversy-tweet-university-north-carolina-wilmington-adams/index.html", "headline": "University of North Carolina Wilmington calls professor's tweets 'vile and inexcusable' following growing backlash online", "published_date": "2020-06-07", "text": "(CNN)A professor at the University of North Carolina Wilmington has come under fire for tweets he posted which the school has called \"vile and inexcusable,\" according to a statement the school provided to CNN Saturday.\nAt the center of this controversy is Mike Adams, a professor of criminology at the university, according to the school's website.

The answer is to counter the speech and confront the speech. This could be the subject of campus-wide discussions,\" Gutterman said.\nThis is not the first time Adams has courted controversy online.\nIn 2016, another change.org petition called for his removal after Adams had published an article titled \"A 'Queer Muslim' Jihad?\" on right-wing news site The Daily Wire. In the article, Adams wrote about a Muslim refugee and LGBT student-activist at the University of North Carolina Wilmington.\nIn 2006, Adams was denied a promotion at the University of North Carolina Wilmington due to his conservative views, according to the Wilmington Star News.\nAdams sued the university and won in 2014 after a jury determined that Adams' speech was a factor in the decision to not promote him, according to court documents. The federal court also ordered the university to pay Adams roughly $50,000 in back pay and over $600,000 for attorney's fees and other costs, the Star News reported.\nOne person unhappy with how Adams has conducted himself on social media is Kaela Bedics, a first-year graduate student pursuing a master's in conflict management and resolution at the school. Bedics first became aware of Adams after the Daily Wire article published.\n\"Though I acknowledge that Mr. Adams has a first amendment right to the freedom of speech, I find his tweets contemptuous and unbecoming of a university professor,\" Bedics told CNN through Twitter.\n\"I can appreciate the desire to focus on more right-wing work and expose students to these ideas in the university setting, but his methods of exposing students to these ideas are, in my opinion, unethical, a means to encourage harassment and violence, and targeted at minorities, women, and members of the LGBTQIA+ community.\""}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/08/us/nyag-calls-for-nypd-overhaul/index.html", "headline": "NY attorney general report calls for NYPD overhaul in response to protests", "published_date": "2020-07-09", "text": "New York (CNN)The New York state attorney general called for an overhaul of the New York Police Department -- including an independent commission to manage the department, more oversight and a uniform use-of-force policy -- as part of her investigation into clashes between police and protesters during demonstrations in response to police killing of George Floyd.\nThe 57-page preliminary report released by Letitia James on Wednesday is one of three probes underway in response to clashes between police officers and protesters across New York City that resulted in more than 2,000 arrests. The full report will be released at later date.\nGov. Andrew Cuomo ordered James to review actions and procedures used by the NYPD. The two other probes include an internal review of officer actions and tactics by the NYPD, and another by the city's corporate counsel and Officer of the Inspector General for the NYPD, an independent city agency.\nJames' report was a summary of findings related to a three-day event in June where she heard testimony from demonstrators and community organizers who described violent clashes with police officers, some of which were caught on video.\n\"It is impossible to deny that many New Yorkers have lost faith in law enforcement,\" said James at a news conference announcing her findings.\nJames said that since May 30 her office has received more than 1,300 submissions online and over the phone, some of which include video for the office to review.\nIn the report, James lays out several sweeping reforms to the structure of the NYPD that include creating a commission that would hire the policing commissioner, who is currently appointed by the mayor; more community oversight by civilian agencies and allowing community groups to have a say in high-ranking promotions as well as the ability to fire the police commissioner, among other recommendations.\n\"Progress cannot and should not wait,\" James said. \"We must begin the hard role of re-evaluating the role of police in society.\"\nThe determinations made in the report are not mandates from the attorney general's office and would need the NYPD, along with city and state lawmakers, to enact the recommendations. The report says James, who is the top law enforcement officer in the state, \"will fight for these reforms to be adopted.\"\nIn a statement a spokeswoman for Mayor Bill de Blasio said that while the mayor looks forward to reading the report, \"we do not believe creating a commission to oversee the NYPD does that.\"\n\"Change comes from accountability, something a commission lacks,\" said spokeswoman Freddi Goldstein. \"If we want to continue moving forward, more bureaucracy is not the answer.\"\nIn response, the NYPD said the report was a \"political and not investigative document.\"\n\"Rather than rehash rhetoric we should come together -- state and local law enforcement and electeds -- and confront and solve the crisis at hand,\" spokesman Richard Esposito said in a statement.\nCuomo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nNYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea testifies before New York Attorney General Letitia James.\nIn her report, James suggested several other reforms to the NYPD.\nShe called for new oversight by a newly formed commission that has the power to hire and fire NYPD leadership, has access to all records and approves the NYPD's budget. The report also recommends the NYPD seek public comment for any rule changes it wants to implement.\nThe report also noted that minor offenses must be decriminalized and the NYPD must be taken out of schools, mental health situations and traffic enforcement, measures that are largely being applied as part of $1 billion shift in funds away from the NYPD in the budget that passed last week.\nAdditionally, the report calls for the Civilian Complaint Review Board, the independent agency charged with oversight of the NYPD, to be strengthened and have final disciplinary authority over the NYPD, the report said. Currently that authority falls to the police commissioner.\nOther policies laid out by James include a call for body camera footage to be made available online and for all officers to go through a certification process that would allow for \"decertifying,\" or taking a badge away from an officer in a case of misconduct.\nIn testimony last month, NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea was asked by James about officers' use of batons and pepper spray -- and responses to viral videos that included an NYPD vehicle accelerating through a crowd of protesters and another in which an officer, who was later charged by the Brooklyn district attorney, was seen shoving a young woman so hard her head smacked into the pavement.\n\"Some used these public demonstrations, protests and marches as opportunities to engage in acts of vandalism, arson, property destruction, looting and most notably targeted attacks against my police officers,\" Shea said at the start of his testimony in June. \"As police officers were trying to do their job they were attacked with bricks, knives, trash cans, glass bottles and other projectiles and other incendiary devices.\"\nThe Police Benevolent Association, the largest police union in the city, said in a statement that \"the report tells only one side of the story and delivers reheated proposals that have been part of the anti-police agenda for decades.\"\nSaid PBA President Patrick Lynch, \"If the goal is to heal the rift between police officers and the public ... that won't be achieved without giving meaningful consideration to the perspective of police officers on the street.\"\nCNN's Sonia Moghe contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/23/us/atlanta-police-officer-brosnan-ajc-interview/index.html", "headline": "Charged officer says he would not have done anything differently on the night Rayshard Brooks was killed", "published_date": "2020-06-23", "text": "(CNN)One of the Atlanta police officers charged in the death of Rayshard Brooks would not have done anything differently that night, he said in an interview with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\nAtlanta police officer Devin Brosnan also called Brooks' death a \"tragedy,\" according to his interview published by the newspaper Tuesday, just hours before the 27-year-old father was to be laid to rest.\n\"At the end of the day, someone lost their life.

I think that's the takeaway,\" Brosnan said. \"I'll tell the truth to anybody who needs to hear it.\"\nBrosnan has not made such an agreement, his lawyer, Don Samuel, who the AJC said sat in on the interview with co-counsel Amanda Clark Palmer, has said. Brosnan did sit down with Fulton County prosecutors for three hours and answered all their questions the day before he was charged, Samuel told the newspaper.\nBrosnan cannot speak to why Howard said what he said, he told the AJC.\n\"I just looked at it like, he could have just said I'm doing the right thing -- I'm talking,\" Brosnan said. \"But it just seemed like it was more important to make it political than it was to get to the truth of the matter and get to the real facts of it. ...

It's not something to make political.\"\nBrosnan will be interviewed Tuesday by the GBI for its investigation of the shooting, the newspaper reported.\nFirst officer to arrive at scene\nBrosnan was the first officer to arrive June 12 after being called to the parking lot of a Wendy's restaurant in south Atlanta. Police were called after Brooks had fallen asleep in his car in the drive-thru lane.\nA second officer, Garrett Rolfe, arrived and conducted a field sobriety test and Breathalyzer test on Brooks. When he failed those tests, the officers tried to handcuff Brooks.\nBrooks struggled with the officers and grabbed Brosnan's Taser, according to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said. In the scuffle, Brosnan was knocked backward and his head struck the pavement. Brosnan suffered a concussion from the blow, his attorney has said.\nAtlanta police officer Devin Brosnan is surrounded by journalists following his release June 18 from the Fulton County Jail in Atlanta.\nThe concussion left Brosnan feeling disoriented and terrified, and it was at this time when Brooks got control of his Taser, he told the AJC. Brosnan did not know all that had happened because of his concussion, he said.\n\"I hear gunfire,\" Brosnan told the AJC. \"I know he still has my Taser. I know there's a crowd. I got up to him and I'm trying to figure out what's going on. You need to make sure you're safe before you can help or do anything else.\"\nIn a video of the incident, Brooks runs and appears to point the Taser in the direction of Rolfe, who shoots him. Two of the shots hit Brooks in the back and a third one hit a nearby vehicle. Brooks later died of his wounds.\nAfter Brooks was shot, Brosnan put his foot on the man, then removed it when he determined Brooks couldn't reach his Taser again, Brosnan told the AJC.\n\"It's totally just an instinctual thing for my own safety,\" he said. \"When I realized I was safe that's when I take it off.

It's only just getting started\nOn August 24, 2019, McClain was stopped by three White officers as he walked home from a convenience store, after a 911 caller described a \"suspicious person,\" according to a police overview of the incident. McClain resisted officer contact, the report says, and a struggle ensued. On one of the officers' body cameras, McClain is heard saying, \"I'm an introvert, please respect the boundaries that I am speaking.\"\nBody cam video shows McClain telling officers that he was trying to stop his music to listen to them, then they begin to arrest him.

According to a letter from the district attorney, McClain suffered a heart attack while in the ambulance, and he was declared brain dead three days later.\nAn autopsy did not determine a cause of death but listed intense physical exertion and a narrow left coronary artery as contributing factors, according to the police overview. The coroner found the amount of ketamine in his system to be a therapeutic amount.\n'He was an angel among humans'\nThe Adams County district attorney, Dave Young, declined to file criminal charges in the case at the time. In February this year, a police review board declared, \"[t]he force applied during the altercation to include the carotid control hold and the force applied during the altercation was within policy and consistent with training.\"\nThe officers in the case were placed on administrative leave following McClain's death, but were later reinstated after prosecutors declined to file charges against them.\nAsked about the social media petition and if it would sway him to take new action in the case, Young told CNN, \"we've got to have the evidence ... so the petitions, the emails, the voicemails and Facebook attacks to me, my family, everyone else expressing their opinions ... is not evidence.\" Young added that he doesn't \"condone the actions of the officers. I think they could've done things differently.\"\nColorado governor signs bill mandating police body cameras and banning chokeholds\nSeparately, the city of Aurora is planning an independent investigation, telling CNN in an email: \"The mayor, City Council and city manager are working to initiate a new independent, external review of the actions of police, firefighters and paramedics in the Elijah McClain case.

Neither will Arizona Diamondbacks right-handed pitcher Mike Leake, according to a statement from his agent. Zimmerman and Leake both said family factored into their decisions.\nRead Desmond's statement in full:\n\"A few weeks ago, I told the social media world a little bit about me that I never talk about. I started it by saying why that was: I don't like sadness and anger. I'd found an even keel allowed me to move through my days with more ease than emotion did. So, I kept it inside. But that comes at an internal cost, and I could no longer keep a lid on what I was feeling. The image of officer Derek Chauvin's knee on the neck of George Floyd, the gruesome murder of a Black man in the street at the hands of a police officer, broke my coping mechanism. Suppressing my emotions became impossible.\nIn the days since I began sharing my thoughts and experiences as a biracial man in America, I've received many requests to elaborate. But, it's hard to know where to begin. And, in truth, there's a lot on my mind. Here's some of it.\nRecently, I took a drive to the Little League fields I was basically raised on here in Sarasota.\nThey're not in great shape. They look run down. Neglected. When I saw a Cal Ripken Little League schedule tacked on a bulletin board, I walked over to check it out, and it was from 2015. The only thing shiny and new, to my eye, was a USSSA banner. Travel ball. Showcases. So, not so much baseball for all anymore... as much as baseball for all who can afford it.\nUniversity of Cincinnati buildings will no longer bear the name of a Reds owner who used racist, anti-Semitic and homophobic slurs\nI walked around those fields, deserted at the time, and my mind raced. I stopped at a memorial for a man named Dick Lee; Coast Federal Head Coach and manager, Sarasota Little League, 1973-1985. There was a quote from him on the plaque:\n'Many men have cherished some of their greatest moments in life while stopping and taking time to reflect back on the young men they have helped develop, from childhood into manhood, with the ability to carry on in life. In no other activity has man been able to see this growth better than he has in the heart and character of this nation.\n'To see our youth grow and develop in the knowledge and skills to play baseball is a reward that only one who has been involved with would know. Baseball not only develops the physical skills of our youth, but develops a person with a knowledge of fair play while always stressing a desire to win.\n'That great moment comes when you look at the final product and realize the job done. There's nothing more satisfying when watching these young men than hearing that familiar voice call out \"Hi, coach!\" transcending that special spirit of pride.'\nI know it sounds simple to say, as a Major League Baseball player, that these fields were important in shaping my life. But I don't mean my career.\nI read Dick Lee's words, and I stood there and I thought about when I was 10, and my stepfather dropped me off for a baseball tryout. He never came back to get me. Later, as I sobbed alone at the top of the bleachers, a kind stranger offered me a chance to make a phone call to alert my mom.\nI thought about the moment, not too long after that, when my coach, John Howard, seeing I was upset about an out or something, wrapped me in an embrace so strong that I can still remember how his arms felt around me. How it felt to be hugged like that; embraced by a man who cared about the way I was feeling.\nThen, another memory hit me: my high school teammates chanting 'White Power!' before games. We would say the Lord's prayer and put our hands in the middle so all the white kids could yell it. Two Black kids on the whole team sitting in a stunned silence the white players didn't seem to notice. I started to walk the fields a bit, and that's when I thought of Antwuan.\n5 things to know for June 30: Coronavirus, SCOTUS, White House, China, social media\nThese fields are where I learned a game that I've played 1,478 times at the Major League level. It started when I was 10, 11, 12 years old -- exactly how old Antwuan was (12) when I met him at the Nationals Youth Baseball Academy in D.C.\nHe couldn't read. He could barely say his ABCs. One morning, when his mom was shuffling Antwuan and his siblings off to their aunt's house at 4 a.m. so she could get to work, they opened their door to a man stabbed to death on the ground. So, no sleep, traumatized by murder literally outside their door, eating who knows what for lunch, they head off to school. And they're expected to perform in a classroom?\nMeanwhile, my kids fly all over the country watching their dad play. They attend private schools, and get extra curriculum from learning centers. They have safe places to learn, grow, develop. But... the only thing dividing us from Antwuan is money.\nIt just doesn't make any sense. Why isn't society's No. 1 priority giving all kids the best education possible? If we seriously want to see change, isn't education where it all starts? Give all kids a safe place to go for eight hours a day. Where their teachers or coaches are happy to see them. Where they feel supported and loved.\nI went back to those Little League fields because I wanted to figure out why they were thriving the way I remembered. What I came away with was more confusion.\nI had the most heartbreak and the most fulfillment right there on those fields -- in the same exact place. I felt the hurt of racism, the loneliness of abandonment, and so many other emotions. But I also felt the triumph of success. The love of others. The support of a group of men pulling for each other and picking one another up as a team.\nTulsa Athletic soccer team ditches the National Anthem before matches to play 'This Land Is Your Land' instead\nI got to experience that because it was a place where baseball could be played by any kid who wanted. It was there, it was affordable, and it was staffed by people who cared.\nBut if we don't have these parks, academies, teachers, coaches, religious institutions -- if we don't have communities investing in people's lives -- what happens to the kids who are just heartbroken and never get that moment of fulfillment?\nIf what Dick Lee knew to be true remains so -- that baseball is about passing on what we've learned to those who come after us in hopes of bettering the future for others -- then it seems to me that America's pastime is failing to do what it could, just like the country it entertains.\nThink about it: right now in baseball we've got a labor war. We've got rampant individualism on the field. In clubhouses we've got racist, sexist, homophobic jokes or flat-out problems. We've got cheating. We've got a minority issue from the top down. One African American GM. Two African American managers. Less than 8% Black players. No Black majority team owners.\nPerhaps most disheartening of all is a puzzling lack of focus on understanding how to change those numbers. A lack of focus on making baseball accessible and possible for all kids, not just those who are privileged enough to afford it.\nIf baseball is America's pastime, maybe it's never been a more fitting one than now.\nAntwuan was 12 years old when he started going to the Nationals Youth Baseball Academy -- because that's when it started existing in his universe as a resource. We got him a tutor, he got into other programs, and he learned to read. He was on the right track.\nHe died when he was 18, shot 31 times in D.C. A 16-year-old kid was just arrested for his murder.\nIt's almost safe to say that the best years of his life came from that Academy... and yet the staff running it have to beg people to invest money and time.\nHow can that be? Why isn't there an academy like that in every single community? Why does Major League Baseball have to have a specific youth baseball affiliate with RBI? Why can't we support teaching the game to all kids -- but especially those in underprivileged communities? Why aren't accessible, affordable youth sports viewed as an essential opportunity to affect kids' development, as opposed to money-making propositions and recruiting chances? It's hard to wrap your head around it.\nI won't tell you that I look around at the world today -- baseball or otherwise -- and feel like I have the answers. I don't. I'm not a perfect person. I kept my emotions inside for so long because it seemed easier to numb myself than to embrace the why behind my feelings.\nBaseball is back. MLB says 60-game season will start July 23 or 24\nDoesn't it seem easier to just block it out when you walk down the street and see women clutch their purse at the sight of you? To push it behind you when you find out your grade school had to hold a meeting for all the students to let them know you and your sister -- two Black kids -- were about to enroll? To slough it off when someone makes a racist joke, or suggests you must be an athlete because how else could you have such a nice house? It forced me into a box.\nAnd, in a lot of ways, I feel like everything in my life has been about boxes.\nI remember, as a biracial kid, I dreaded filling out paperwork. I feared those boxes: white, Black, other. The biracial seat is a completely unique experience, and there are so many times you feel like you belong everywhere and nowhere at once. I knew I wasn't walking around with the privilege of having white skin, but being raised by a white mother (an incredible mother), I never fully felt immersed in Black culture.\nI almost always checked Black. Because I felt the prejudices. That's what being Black meant to me: do you feel the hurt? Do you experience racism? Do you feel like you're at a slight disadvantage?\nEven in baseball. I'm immensely grateful for my career, and for all people who influenced it. But when I reflect on it, I find myself seeing those same boxes. The golden rules of baseball -- don't have fun, don't pimp home runs, don't play with character. Those are white rules. Don't do anything fancy. Take it down a notch. Keep it all in the box.\nIt's no coincidence that some of my best years came when I played under Davey Johnson, whose No. 1 line to me was: 'Desi, go out there and express yourself.' If, in other years, I'd just allowed myself to be who I was -- to play free and the way I was born to play, would I have been better?\nIf we didn't force Black Americans into white America's box, think of how much we could thrive.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has made this baseball season one that is a risk I am not comfortable taking. But that doesn't mean I'm leaving baseball behind for the year. I'll be right here, at my old Little League, and I'm working with everyone involved to make sure we get Sarasota Youth Baseball back on track. It's what I can do, in the scheme of so much. So, I am.\nWith a pregnant wife and four young children who have lots of questions about what's going on in the world, home is where I need to be right now. Home for my wife, Chelsey. Home to help.

Below is an edited version of their conversation.\nCNN: What do you want people to know about the men in your program?\nSheldon Smith: Our young, fearless men who attend our program have beautiful hearts. What they've had to overcome and how much they just love their kids -- they are volunteering their time so that they can find the tools, skills, knowledge and resources that they need so that they can be better fathers.\nNo one is making them be there. They just want more. Many of us want more. But oftentimes if you can't see it, you can't be it. And the communities that they come from is only what they see. They come from disadvantaged and unfortunate situations, broken families. So, we are that shining light of hope. I tell our young men all the time that they are myth-busters.\nCNN: Normally, your 12-week program also covers felony street law and family law. What does that entail?\nSmith: From the very beginning, we knew that Black and Brown men who joined the program needed to learn how to interact with law enforcement. We wanted to make sure it was done in a friendly way. So, we invited officers into the class, along with attorneys who fight for issues like this. Family law is just as important for them to learn about custody rights, child support and things that can railroad you into the criminal justice system.\nWe know in disadvantaged communities they are overly policed. And that dynamic brought about fathers and the community feeling different with police engagement. We want to practice it and be able to get it out and understand it. And it's not just role-playing amongst each other. It's inviting law enforcement and attorneys in at the same time so we can have this broad perspective together of how it all comes together. It's bringing about more unity.\nThe truth is, as Black and Brown people, we shouldn't be training and teaching our kids and prepping them for how to deal with the police or how to put your hands up or all the windows down or don't reach for your wallet quick. That's not normal. We've reconditioned ourselves to accept that as the norm. And right now, as a nation we have an opportunity to change that.\nCNN: How have recent events brought your work into a new light?\nSmith: When I first seen the incident with George Floyd, I was disappointed and saddened. And the other side of it is it happened during Covid-19, when everyone was at home, looking at TV. When the world could see it. And now it's been a global reaction. And we're talking about injustices in America that need to be changed.\nWe know that it's been a big struggle in Black fatherhood, and now that black or brown issues are coming up to the forefront, we are excited as an organization, because we get a chance to talk about our work in a different way. Black fatherhood is in the forefront of everything that we do because we know that when people say mentoring, they really mean that they need their dads at home. But if we're killing their fathers, if we're overly incarcerating their fathers, and we're doing it with no reason, with no compassion -- what will our children have left?\nWe have to continue to believe and work together, and not make it about when a death occurs that this is a time we need to stand up. Supporting black and brown youth and them going on to do successful things will happen. And the more our next generation of kids see it, the more it's going to continue. So, we just have to continue to be that example. Once you invest, build and believe, you bring about a different solution.\nWant to get involved?

Military doctors said their approach kept the case count to just five among 10,000 recruits at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland in Texas in March and April.\nThe base used techniques including quarantine, social distancing, early trainee screening, rapid isolation and monitored re-entry to slow the transmission, the researchers said in a report published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Tuesday.\nA quarter of US nursing homes report at least one coronavirus infection, first official tally shows\n\"Beginning March 17, all new recruits were segregated upon arrival for a two-week arrival quarantine on an area of the base separated from the main cohort of trainees,\" Dr. Joseph Marcus of the Brooke Army Medical Center and colleagues wrote in their report. \"In addition, all trainees were instructed to maintain a distance of at least 6 feet between one another to ensure social distancing.\"\nIn April, the use of face coverings was made mandatory. The strategies put into place at the base meant that the rate of infection was significantly lower than that of other communal living environments, such as homeless shelters.\nOn the other hand, warmer weather is unlikely to stop the spread of coronavirus, Dr. Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, said in a blog post Tuesday.\n\"Climate only would become an important seasonal factor in controlling COVID-19 once a large proportion of people within a given community are immune or resistant to infection,\" Collins wrote, citing experts in infectious disease transmission and climate modeling.\n\"We'll obviously have to wait a few months to get the data. But for now, many researchers have their doubts that the COVID-19 pandemic will enter a needed summertime lull,\" he added.\nCollins is just the latest expert to throw cold water on the theory, boosted by President Donald Trump, that speculated heat would lessen the spread and possibly kill the virus altogether.\nDr. Fauci optimistic about vaccine\nThe US should have 100 million doses of one candidate Covid-19 vaccine by the end of the year, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and a member of the White House coronavirus task force, said Tuesday.\nUS should have a 'couple hundred million' doses of a Covid-19 vaccine by the start of 2021, Fauci says\n\"Then, by the beginning of 2021, we hope to have a couple hundred million doses,\" Fauci said during a live question and answer session with the Journal of the American Medical Association.\nIt's still not clear whether the vaccine will be effective against the novel coronavirus.

She wrote that she continued to be surprised \"at how little Black lives matter.\"\n\"That's really what Black Lives Matter was for me,\" Garza told MSNBC. \"And that's why I said Black people, I love you. I love us. And that our lives matter. And that we matter. And that Black lives matter.\"\nThe phrase \"Black lives matter\" inspired Garza's friend, Patrisse Cullors, to create a hashtag. Almost instantly, it went viral.\n\"I wanted it to go viral,\" Cullors, who co-founded Black Lives Matter with Garza and Opal Tometi, told CNN.\n\"On July 15th, 2013 I said that Alicia and I had created a thing called #BlackLivesMatter and we hope that it will be bigger than we can ever imagine,\" Cullors said. \"Over the last seven years we've developed more infrastructure and we've become more organized.\"\nMomentum around the movement has grown amid calls for justice following the deaths of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and George Floyd.\nThe phrase \"Black Lives Matter\" is being used now as more than just a hashtag -- it's a rallying cry. At protests, it's what many demonstrators write on their signs or chant as they march. Online, it's what many have used to spread the message against police brutality. And globally, it's being used by many to show solidarity with Black people.\nWhile many believe the movement is more accepted than it once was, others remain skeptical of what it accomplishes and question its impact.\nHere's what you need to know about the evolution of the movement, and why it matters.\nGrowth of a movement\nBlack Lives Matter is one of the most well-known organizations fighting for the well-being of Black people.\nStudies show that segregation persists in many American cities, leaving majority Black communities behind. BLM's goal, according to its website, is to eradicate anti-Blackness and create a society where Black people are able to thrive in the US.\n\"We live in a country built to keep us away from these resources that we need,\" said Kailee Scales, managing director of the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation.\nScales referenced the data. Police officers are almost four times as likely to use force on Black people than White people. Black people are also jailed at a disproportionate rate. Black Americans have lower access to health care and lack the same access to quality education.\n\"Folks in the movement have been consistently fighting to reverse that trend, to raise awareness that this is not the way we're supposed to live,\" Scales told CNN.\nSince the hashtag launched, the organization has become more formalized, taken on specific branding and branched out into nationwide chapters -- all in an attempt to solidify the group and allow them to create national campaigns while engaging the broader community.\nOrganizers put together a website, which led to the development of local chapters of BLM, first in Los Angeles in 2013 and then throughout the country, according to Scales.\nLeft to right, co-founders of BLM, Opal Tometi, Alicia Garza and Patrisse Cullors appear onstage during The New York Women's Foundation Celebrating Women Breakfast in 2015.\nAfter the protests in Ferguson, Missouri, against police brutality in 2014, the organization became more well known. In 2017 it became incorporated as the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, Inc.\nToday the network consists of 13 official chapters in the US, plus three more in Canada, according to the BLM website. Local chapters are semi-autonomous, meaning they \"do the work that makes sense\" for their communities, Scales said.\nThe structure allows the group to have an impact at all levels -- doing work both nationally and locally, she said. Each chapter works a little differently and has different focuses, depending on community needs.\nThe Chicago chapter, for example, focuses more on police accountability, while the Boston chapter does a lot of activity around mutual aid, Scales said.\nProtests in Los Angeles, after the murder of George Floyd.\nIn Los Angeles BLM activists have been at the forefront of the defund police movement, meeting with local politicians about a proposal they call the People's Budget, which would reallocate funding from the Los Angeles Police Department.\nThe group has called for defunding the police for at least five years, Black Lives Matter Los Angeles co-founder Melina Abdullah told CNN. The most recent push began in May, and at the time the chapter had little support from local politicians.\nAfter George Floyd's killing, however, the group gained momentum and received some support from a few members of the Los Angeles City Council.\nIn June, after pressure from BLMLA and massive protests, the council unanimously approved a measure to develop an unarmed model of crisis response that would replace police officers with community-based responders for nonviolent calls.\nFollowing the vote, City Councilmember Herb Wesson Jr., who authored the motion with Council President Nury Martinez, said in a tweet that he looks \"forward to continuing this work alongside\" BLMLA.\nAnd there is more work to be done, Abdullah said.\n\"(We) never thought that that (amount) was anywhere near enough,\" she told CNN. \"But it's a step forward that we forced.\"\nThe different chapters are bound by a set of guiding principles, which work to ground the individual entities.\nBut they also work together. Chapters tend to work across state lines, Abdullah told CNN. When the BLM chapter in South Bend, Indiana, was getting started, Abdullah said the group worked closely with BLMLA -- specifically comparing notes on the terms of mayors Pete Buttigieg and Eric Garcetti.\nThere's a growing call to defund the police. Here's what it means\nIt's worth noting that not every protest or demonstration is part of the Black Lives Matter network, as some may be organized by people simply using the movement's name. And not every person attending a BLM protest is a part of their local BLM chapter.\nThe movement is largely decentralized, with no one besides managing director Scales receiving pay, said Abdullah, who also works as a professor at California State University in Los Angeles.\nChapters tend to have a loose leadership structure, with a focus on on-the-ground organizing -- allowing chapters the autonomy to organize in the way they see fit.\nUntil George Floyd's death, Abdullah said BLMLA had only raised $100,000 in the last seven years, money that it used for \"the basic cost of organizing,\" things like renting rooms, making copies, printing banners and hiring unarmed security. They also try to provide limited support to families who lose members to police brutality, like aiding with funeral costs, which Abdullah said can sometimes run up to $20,000.\nAnd unless money is earmarked specifically for the local chapters, money donated through the main network goes to the larger global network, Abdullah said. Chapters can ask for a little money from the national organization, but it's not always a significant amount, she said.\nBut with donations streaming in after Floyd's death, BLMLA has more money than it has ever had.\n\"We're stepping back to take a minute and process what we should be doing with the newfound money that we've never had before,\" she said.\n'All Lives Matter' and other backlash\nWith more notoriety comes more scrutiny, and the Black Lives Matter movement has experienced its fair share of criticism.\nSome have said while they support the movement's cause, they are not a fan of its approach, contrasting some of the protests today to the peaceful ones of the civil rights movement of the 1960s.\nMany have condemned the more progressive demands of the cause, most notably the call to defund the police, which would instead invest those funds in communities, especially marginalized ones where much of the policing occurs.\nWhy saying 'All lives matter' misses the big picture\nLike Abdullah said, the call to defund the police has been a key priority of the movement for years. But as these calls increase, police unions across the country have dug in to protect their own -- even though the movement has support from organizations like Amnesty International and video evidence of officers using excessive force against protesters.\nAnd the notion still faces pushback from people on both sides of the political aisle. President Donald Trump has defended the police. Meanwhile, politicians like Gov. Tony Evers of Wisconsin, a Democrat, has said defunding goes too far.\nOthers have called the movement too radical.\nIn Arizona, Rep. Walt Blackman, a Black GOP member of the Arizona Legislature, labeled BLM a \"terrorist organization\" in an interview with Fox News Radio affiliate KFYI. He then told the Arizona Republic in a follow up interview that BLM is an \"ideology that goes against the very concepts and precepts of our principles in the United States.\"\nCritics have also responded to the phrase \"Black Lives Matter\" by coining their own slogans, such as \"All Lives Matter,\" which some argue minimizes the current struggle Black people face against systemic racism, and \"Blue Lives Matter,\" referring to the lives of police.\nTrump previously called the words \"Black Lives Matter\" a \"symbol of hate\" in a tweet criticizing New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio for \"denigrating\" Fifth Avenue in Manhattan with a BLM mural.\nStill, Michael Kazin, who studies social movements at Georgetown University, said it's surprising that the movement hasn't received more backlash. He said it's the first time in history that a movement focused on Black equality has seen this kind of support from White people.\n\"Even in the '60s, with the (March on Washington), polls at the time never had more than 15, 20% support among Whites,\" Kazin, who is also the co-editor of the democratic-socialist publication Dissent Magazine, told CNN.\nThere's been an outpouring of support from diverse populations, he said. He used Portland, Oregon, as an example, where federal officers have used tear gas and force against on majority-White protesters.\n\"We're seeing huge crowds in little cities, or even where there's hardly any Black people,\" Kazin said. \"That's new. That didn't happen in the '60s, or even in 2013.\"\nWhy people are rallying behind BLM\nIt's been said that this moment feels different. It's bigger, more mainstream. White people are protesting just as much as people of color.\nEven large corporations and brands, which may have been silent in the past, are getting involved.\nLast month NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said \"Black Lives Matter\" in an apology video, a far cry from the league's stance during the 2016-17 season, when Colin Kaepernick became increasingly vocal about police brutality to the chagrin of the league. Kaepernick has not been with a team since.\nCompanies like Peloton, Disney, Facebook and others have spoken up against racial injustice, while the CEO of Netflix donated $120 million to historically Black colleges and universities.\nTaylor Swift, who previously stayed away from anything remotely controversial, has voiced her support for the BLM movement, and even called for the removal of Confederate monuments in Tennessee. Meanwhile, Seth Rogen, Steve Carrell and others have donated to bail funds for protesters.\nHide Caption\n37 of 37\nPhotos: Protests across the globe after George Floyd's death\nFrench police clash with protesters during a Black Lives Matter protest in Paris on Saturday, June 13.\nHide Caption\n1 of 37\nWith the rise of social media in the 2010s, images showing police brutality against Black people have reached a much wider audience. Now a whole generation has grown up exposed to the issue of systemic racism.\nOr, as Minneapolis community organizer Shanene Herbert put it, the trauma.\n\"They (young people) have experienced trauma,\" she told CNN. \"Seeing your friends, your families and even yourself harassed by the police and killed by the police, it's traumatic. And they don't know what to do with that.\"\nMore people are demanding change. And BLM has been a big motivator in that shift.\nMary Westbrook, who lives in Philadelphia and participated in the city's protests in June, told CNN that she felt it was important for her to support the movement.\nThe three reasons Black Lives Matter marchers refuse to quit\nWestbrook, who is White, was among a group of demonstrators that was sprayed with tear gas. Afterward, she shared an image of herself on Twitter, noting her \"face and eyes are on fire.\"\n\"I've lived in this city for 16 years,\" the 38-year-old told CNN in a Twitter message in June. \"I am a children's librarian at the library right there on the Parkway (which is why I know the area and streets there really well). I see every day what black and other POC are dealing with in this city.\"\nIn the last seven years, BLM activists have made their message mainstream, according to Marcia Chatelain, author of \"Franchise: The Golden Arches in Black America.\"\n\"There's been a shift in the public and a willingness to engage with their ideas,\" Chatelain, an American studies professor at Georgetown University, told CNN.\nFor example, she said, \"people are willing to take a second to understand what defunding the police and prison abolition are all about.\"\nWhat the future holds\nWhen asked what she hopes for BLM's future, co-founder Cullors said she knows the movement will win.\nThe next Greatest Generation\n\"I know this because our work is full of love, healing and dignity,\" she said. \"And we center Black people's humanity and life over our death and decimation.\"\nThe task isn't an easy one. Kazin, the Georgetown professor, pointed out that the BLM movement is about power -- having power to decide how policing will look, or having power to access quality education.\nBLM signs in windows, anti-racist reading lists -- all these things are good, Kazin said. But unless they are coupled with a true shift in power and larger political solidarity efforts, little will change.\nStill, people are listening now. And Scales, like Cullors, is optimistic.\n\"At this point, we don't stop,\" she said. \"We're not able to relax. It's now the opportunity to push for the true transformation that we've been working for.\"\nCNN's Christina Zdanowicz contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/23/us/eric-garner-officer-misconduct-complaints/index.html", "headline": "Disciplinary record of ex-officer who held Eric Garner in chokehold is finally released", "published_date": "2020-06-23", "text": "(CNN)A review of newly obtained disciplinary records of the former police officer who held Eric Garner in a chokehold before he died shows the officer had seven misconduct cases investigated against him in the five years before Garner's 2014 death.\nThe release of the records comes on the heels of the New York State legislature repealing a law known as 50-a, which shielded police disciplinary records from being viewed by the public for years.\n\"I'm so glad for the transparency,\" Garner's mother, Gwen Carr, told CNN Tuesday. \"I just think going forward we shouldn't have to fight and wait five years to get the disciplinary records of the police officers who recklessly kill.\"\nGwen Carr, mother of the late Eric Garner, after meeting with federal prosecutors who announced last year they would not bring charges against NYPD cop Daniel Pantaleo in the death of her son.\nCellphone video shows Daniel Pantaleo, a White New York Police Department officer, maintaining a chokehold as Garner, who is Black, is taken to the ground in Staten Island, crying out, \"I can't breathe.\" Police were trying to arrest Garner, 43, because he was allegedly selling loose cigarettes illegally.\nPantaleo was never criminally charged in Garner's death. The officer was fired in August 2019 after an administrative judge overseeing a police department disciplinary trial found him guilty of using a chokehold on Garner.\nDuring Pantaleo's trial his disciplinary records were not allowed to be released publicly due to the shield law. The decision made by an NYPD judge in his trial was also sealed because of the law.\nSeventeen complaints were filed\nThe history of allegations made against Pantaleo was released Friday by New York City's Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB), an independent oversight agency that reviews complaints against police officers. Seventeen complaints against Pantaleo were filed with the agency from 2009 to 2014, the year Garner was killed. They resulted in eight cases being opened against Pantaleo, which included the case involving Garner's death. Three of those cases had claims that the CCRB deemed were \"substantiated,\" including Garner's.\nWant to reform the police? Hire more women\nOne case that the CCRB substantiated was from an incident in 2011 where Pantaleo allegedly abused his power when conducting a vehicle stop and search. It resulted in Pantaleo receiving \"instructions\" as a penalty, according to the disciplinary record.\nAnother substantiated case against Pantaleo from 2012 alleged that he abused his power when stopping and searching a person. That case resulted in a departmental disciplinary trial where Pantaleo was found guilty and was penalized by having to forfeit two vacation days, according to the disciplinary record.\nCNN has reached out to Pantaleo's attorney for comment on the release of his disciplinary records.\nCCRB Chair Fred Davie in a statement to CNN praised grassroots organizations for fighting to change laws to make records like these accessible to the public.\nThere's no playbook for the battle between mayors and police right now\n\"For too long, New York Civil Rights Law Section 50-a made it virtually impossible for civilians to know anything about NYPD misconduct in their communities,\" Davie said. \"The repeal of 50-a is a major step toward bolstering public confidence in the disciplinary system, allowing for more comprehensive reporting about police misconduct, and ultimately, changing the dynamic between police and civilians for the better.\"\nThe disciplinary history that was released to CNN only shows complaints filed to the CCRB. CNN has also requested Pantaleo's full disciplinary history, as well as the NYPD trial judge's full decision in Pantaleo's disciplinary trial, which The New York Times previously obtained. The department has received \"a significant number\" of requests for disciplinary records, which it now needs to redact as required by the Freedom of Information Law, said NYPD Detective Denise Moroney.\n\"The Department is making every effort to do this as quickly as possible,\" Moroney said in a statement to CNN.\nPantaleo filed a lawsuit against the city of New York in 2019 over his firing. His attorney, Stuart London, told CNN at the time of the filing that all of Pantaleo's contact with Garner \"were appropriate and taught in the academy.\"\nThe city delayed holding a disciplinary trial\nCarr, who sat through Pantaleo's disciplinary trial, has long decried the lack of transparency in not being able to see the disciplinary history of any of the police officers who were involved in her son's death.\n\"Immediately after my son was murdered we knew none of this about the officer,\" Carr said, referring to Pantaleo.\nNYPD commissioner testifies in ongoing investigation into interactions between police and the public\nCarr said through the help of police reform advocacy groups she was able to learn about Pantaleo's history piecemeal, as people who had been allegedly abused by him came forward.\nBecause of what she slowly learned about Pantaleo's history, she pushed for a departmental trial for five years, she said. The city delayed holding a disciplinary trial for Pantaleo while waiting for the Justice Department to make a decision on whether it would charge Pantaleo.\nCarr was further emboldened to continue pushing for justice for her son after Pantaleo's disciplinary records were leaked to the progressive news website Think Progress in 2017.\nNew York City Council passes sweeping police reform bills\nGarner's last words, \"I can't breathe,\" is a phrase that has become a chant protesters use to decry deaths of Black people at the hands of police, including George Floyd, who was seen with a Minneapolis Police officer kneeling on his neck for nearly nine minutes before he died in May. All four former officers involved in Floyd's killing face charges.\nAnd over the weekend, a New York City man appears to have been held in a chokehold by another NYPD officer, who has been suspended without pay. The interaction was caught on video and happened less than two weeks after lawmakers placed chokehold bans at the state and city level.\n\"Even though we change laws we have to heal hearts and change minds in order for this to work,\" Carr said. \"All the law changing is not going to work unless the superiors hold the officers' feet to the fire and really enforce these laws.\""}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/03/us/what-is-national-guard-trnd/index.html", "headline": "The National Guard has a long history of being called out during protests - but not in numbers like this", "published_date": "2020-06-03", "text": "(CNN)The National Guard.\nMaybe you've seen them in your community in recent months in a broad range of responsibilities: from sewing face masks for coronavirus patients to, in recent days, preventing property damage during protests.\nRight now, about 74,000 Guardsmen have been activated across the US. That's more than at any other point in recent history, according to the National Guard Bureau.\n\"This civil unrest mission is an uncomfortable mission,\" Gen. Joseph Lengyel, chief of the National Guard Bureau, said in a statement to CNN. \"Our Guard members are from these communities.\"\nHere's a breakdown of what the National Guard is and what its members do -- including in moments of civil unrest.\nWhat is the National Guard, and what does it do?\nThe National Guard is a group of military members that serve on a part-time basis, usually within the US. It originated as a militia of colonists in the 17th century and evolved into a localized military response.\nNational Guard members usually respond to domestic emergencies like natural disasters, though in the last several months, they've assisted with coronavirus testing and disinfection. In other years, they've done activities as mundane as sorting mail during a postal strike.\nEvery state and territory (plus Washington) has a National Guard. And because they're state-operated, National Guard members who are activated in that state are typically residents of that state.\nRight now, they're mobilizing to respond to \"civil unrest\" in at least 31 states and Washington as a result of protests against police brutality. It's the latest major protest the Guard's been involved with in the last 60 years.\nA protester speaks in front of the California National Guard during a demonstration in Los Angeles.\nWho makes up the National Guard?\nGuard members belong to either the Army or Air National Guards. Though they're military personnel, they typically work civilian jobs, and they undergo training drills one weekend a month and at least two full weeks per year.\nHow many Guard members are there?\nThere are over 450,000 soldiers and airmen currently in the National Guard, the National Guard Bureau told CNN.\nAnd right now, there are around 74,000 members on duty in all 50 states. Many of them were previously activated to assist with Covid-19 relief, which included sewing, disinfecting and testing.\nAbout 30,000 of them have activated in 31 states plus DC to monitor protests, enforce curfews and support police.\nThe previous high was in 2005, when 51,000 members activated to assist New Orleans residents after Hurricane Katrina. And at 74,000, that's almost 4.5 times more than active duty troops in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan.\nNational Guard soldiers patrol near the 5th police precinct in Minneapolis.\nWhat does it mean to 'activate' the National Guard, and who has that power?\nWhen a state's National Guard is \"activated,\" that means that a governor asked them for support for a domestic crisis. \"Support\" can look differently depending on the situation.\nThe Guard is federally funded but state-controlled, though the President has the power to call on them, too. They can also be deployed overseas, if needed.\nIn response to the nationwide protests, President Donald Trump said he recommends every governor deploy the National Guard in \"sufficient numbers that we dominate the streets.\"\nWhat powers does the National Guard have?\nThe National Guard can perform law enforcement actions under state governors' command, unlike active military members, who are forbidden from law enforcement actions unless the President invokes the Insurrection Act, which allows the federal government to deploy active troops in the US.\nIn most cases, National Guard members are under the direction of governors or the President, depending on who requested their service. And in that capacity, they do what the state or federal leaders ask.\nIn some cases, National Guardsmen are armed. Minnesota National Guard members are carrying ammunition now after the FBI informed them of a \"credible lethal threat,\" Army Maj. Gen. Jon Jensen, the Adjutant General of the Minnesota National Guard, told reporters.\nMinnesota National Guard soldiers patrol a burned street in Minneapolis.\nWhy are National Guard members called to protests, and what do they do?\nGovernors (or Presidents) usually call on Guard members during protests to quell \"civil unrest,\" whether that means protecting protesters, assisting law enforcement or ending riots.\nCivil support missions provide the following, according to the National Guard Bureau: Support to law enforcement, protection of US citizens' lives and property and protection of critical infrastructure.\nGen. Joseph Lengyel said this civil unrest mission is \"one of the most difficult and dangerous homeland missions we do.\"\nIn the current nationwide protests, which erupted after George Floyd died in police custody, Guard members will do what governors -- or the President -- asks of them.\n\"The situation remains fluid and the numbers may change rapidly as governors assess their needs,\" the Guard said in a news release.\nIn the protests so far, low-flying National Guard helicopters in DC hovered over crowds who were out past the city's curfew to protest, kicking up strong winds and debris. The Guard said it would investigate.\nAlso in DC, CNN reported that National Guardsmen fired pepper spray at protesters who threw fireworks toward police. Pentagon officials have said that National Guard members have not used tear gas or rubber bullets.\nIn 1970, Ohio National Guard arrived at Kent State University in Ohio after an ROTC building was burned. Guard members later shot and killed four students.\nWhat other protests have National Guard members been called to?\nThe National Guard has been called to several major protests, many of them related to racism.\nNational Guard members were activated in 1962 during violent protests incited by a mob of 3,000 angry white Southerns after the first black student was admitted to the University of Mississippi.\nThen in the 1965 Selma to Montgomery March, the Alabama National Guard activated to protect those marching after local police beat them. When Martin Luther King Jr. died in 1968, they were called to break up riots.\nIn 1970, Ohio National Guardsmen shot and killed four students and injured nine others during a protest against the Vietnam War.\nAnd then in 1992, the California National Guard mobilized when riots erupted after the officers accused of beating Rodney King were acquitted."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/08/us/fredericksburg-slave-auction-block-removal-trnd/index.html", "headline": "A Virginia city finally removed its 800-pound slave auction block after years of deliberation", "published_date": "2020-06-08", "text": "(CNN)The city of Fredericksburg, Virginia, has removed an auction block marking the spot where African Americans were once displayed and sold as slaves.\nThe 800-pound slave auction block was removed from a downtown corner Friday morning after nearly two years of deliberation among City Council, months of legal action that threatened to keep the stone in place, and weeks of postponement due to the state's coronavirus restrictions.\nThe auction block is removed by workers in Fredericksburg, Virginia, on Friday, June 5.\n\"The institution of slavery was central to the community prior to the Civil War,\" said John Hennessy, chief historian of Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park. \"The trauma involved in that passed through generations.

I was very disturbed by it,\" said Shea, who agreed that D'Andraia used excessive force. \"That's why I took the action I did.\"\nShea responds to specific allegations of police force\nShea only answered questions from James, as former US Attorney Loretta Lynch and NYU Law professor Barry Friedman, who were present at previous testimonies, were not there on Monday.\nWhen asked about the use of pepper spray on protesters -- and specifically an incident where an officer was seen pulling down the mask of a protester -- Shea said these actions were \"completely inappropriate.\" However, he said it is an officer's right to use such methods, depending on the circumstance.\nHe also said he was against the curfew, but understood the decision that was made during a conversation with both Governor Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio.\nNew York City Mayor de Blasio says Gov. Cuomo owes NYPD an apology\nJames asked Shea about officers who covered their names and badges, a common complaint among many protesters who testified. Shea said officers were not supposed to cover their shield numbers and name tags, but noted many wore black bands in honor of those in the NYPD that died from Covid-19.\nThe NYPD Commissioner said he trusted the discretion of the officers who arrested legal observers who wearing shirts that clearly labeled them as such.\n\"We go by the facts in front of us,\" Shea said.\nShea also threw his support behind an officer who was seen on video wielding his gun in Manhattan, moments after another officer, who was wearing a helmet, was bashed in the head with a brick.\nJames asked, \"You believe that that's appropriate?\"\n\"You have a long period of time where literally everything but the kitchen sink was being thrown at the officers,\" Shea said. \"Officers were being attacked on that corner for a long period of time. And the officer, the superior, a lieutenant, who is still injured at home, by the way, was cowardly attacked with a brick. It was not a bottle smashed down on his head. And this was the incident, that environment, to what the officer was pulling his gun out to.\"\nReforms likely won't impact department operations, Shea says\nIn late May, a video that surfaced on social media appeared to show a New York City Police Department truck plowing through a crowd during protests in wake of Floyd's death.\nThe 27-second video, which was posted to Twitter, shows an NYPD truck in front of a crowd throwing objects at the vehicle. There is a barricade in front of the truck. The truck then appears to drive into the barricade, knocking over protestors. Screaming and yelling are heard while a person is seen jumping on top of the truck. It's unclear if there were any injuries.\nVideo appears to show NYPD truck plowing through crowd 01:16\nShea defended police officers who were seen on video driving through throngs of protesters in Brooklyn, charging that the crowd who pelted the vehicle with bricks and garbage cans made it a life or death situation.\n\"Is it your testimony that the police car was an appropriate use of force?\"James asked.\n\"I am not saying that the police car was an appropriate use of force,\" Shea responded. \"I am saying that the officers were set upon and attacked and thankfully they were able to get out of that situation with, thankfully, no injuries to anyone.\"\nShea said any police reforms would most likely not impact the department operations.\n\"We've already implemented many of the laws that were passed,\" Shea said. \"Like you mentioned the filming at the scene, the choke hold, many of these things are already memorialized in our policies.\"\nCNN's Amir Vera contributed to this report"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/23/us/robert-e-lee-baton-rouge-bernard-resignation-call-trnd/index.html", "headline": "Baton Rouge school board calls for the resignation of fellow member following viral video", "published_date": "2020-06-23", "text": "(CNN)Members of the East Baton Rouge Parish School Board are calling for the resignation of a fellow member after a viral video showed her being criticized for her defense of a school named after Robert E.

I promise to be part of the solution and to listen to the concerns of all members of our community. I stand with you, in love and respect.\"\n'A dog whistle message'\nChambers called Bernard an example of the community's racism and called for her resignation as well during the hearing.\nHe told CNN's Don Lemon Monday night that memorializing confederate figures has a severe impact.\n\"You can send a dog whistle message to black people that no matter how far you've come we're never going to recognize you equally,\" Chambers said.\nSchools and monuments should include Black American historical elected officials in national memory, he said, suggesting the school should be named after someone such as Louisiana's first Black governor, P.B.S. Pinchback.\n\"We need to know that there were people centuries ago that were advocating for us,\" he said. \"The truth is folks who got elected in the 1800s are the impetus of Jim Crow laws because they saw the power of the black folk. They saw the power of black unity and progress and so they immediately put laws in place that prevented that progress for 150 years, and then they began to honor those people by naming buildings.\"\nGarcy Chambers Jr. addresses the hearing Thursday.\nChambers accuses Bernard of online shopping during hearing\nAs Chambers stepped up to address the school board Thursday, he brought a photo of what he saw Bernard doing during the hearing.\n\"I had intended to get up here and talk about how racist Robert E Lee was, but I'm gonna talk about you, Connie,\" Chambers said. \"Sitting over there shopping while we're talking about Robert E. Lee. This is a picture of you shopping while we're talking about racism in history in this country.\"\nBernard, who did not respond to CNN's request for comment, told The Advocate on Friday that what people saw on her laptop was not her shopping, but rather a pop-up ad that she failed to close.\n\"I wasn't shopping,\" she told the newspaper. \"I was actually taking notes, paying attention, reading online comments.\"\nChambers, though, then posted video with a 20-second clip of her scrolling on the shopping website.\nThe statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee stands behind a crowd of hundreds of White nationalists, neo-Nazis and members of the \"alt-right\" during the \"Unite the Right\" rally August 12, 2017, in Charlottesville, Virginia.\nThe history of Robert E. Lee\nBernard encouraged people to learn more about Lee to defend keeping the school his namesake, but Chambers said Lee was a \"brutal\" slave master, cited a slave's account of being beaten, and told the board to \"stop being in 1856.\"\nLee personally owned enslaved people and he assumed command of 189 others after his father-in-law died in 1857, according to the American Civil War Museum.\nThe father-in-law's will stipulated that the enslaved people be freed within five years, but Lee petitioned state courts to extend his control over them, the museum states. State courts denied his petitions, and Lee officially freed the enslaved people on December 29, 1862 -- just days before the Emancipation Proclamation.\nThere is a difference between statues of Abraham Lincoln and Confederate generals\nLee also punished escape attempts harshly. In 1859, he ordered the whipping of three enslaved people who tried to escape, according to an 1866 account by Wesley Norris.\n\"Gen. Lee, in the meantime, stood by, and frequently enjoined (a county constable) to lay it on well, an injunction which he did not fail to heed; not satisfied with simply lacerating our naked flesh, Gen. Lee then ordered the overseer to thoroughly wash our backs with brine, which was done,\" Norris said in the account.\nOn Facebook last week, the school board member who introduced the resolution, Dadrius Lanus, asked Bernard to more closely look into this history.\n\"I say to you Ms. Bernard that Robert E. Lee is not a man to be honored by our students, especially students of color!\" he wrote. \"To force our students to attend a school with such a name is not only degrading but it is culturally insensitive and a violation of our students' rights!\"\nCNN's Amanda Jackson and Nicole Williams contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/23/us/five-things-june-23-trnd/index.html", "headline": "5 things to know for June 23: Covid, elections, Rayshard Brooks, police, immigration", "published_date": "2020-06-23", "text": "Get '5 Things' in your inbox\nIf your day doesn't start until you're up to speed on the latest headlines, then let us introduce you to your new favorite morning fix.

In the US, young people are testing positive in the South and West as Americans fail to heed mask-wearing and social distancing guidelines. India, which has the fourth highest number of cases in the world, is allowing a religious festival to go ahead in a limited capacity, even as case numbers surge. In Saudi Arabia, the Hajj pilgrimage is still on, though officials will strictly limit the number of people who can take part. South Korea is seeing a \"second wave\" of infections, which a top health official says began during the May holiday period. And Brazil has reported an average of 1,000 virus-related deaths a day over the past week.\nCrematorium busier than ever as Mexico reopens economy 02:33\n2. Primary elections\nVoters in Kentucky and New York head to the polls -- or face absentee ballot deadlines -- today, as Democratic incumbents and establishment favorites square off against progressive challengers. In Kentucky, former fighter pilot Amy McGrath is up against progressive state Rep. Charles Booker. Until a few weeks ago, McGrath was considered a shoo-in to take on Sen. Mitch McConnell in November. But Booker's campaign has seen a surge in momentum as the nation reckons with racism and police brutality and a pandemic that disproportionately hurts minorities and the poor. Interest in the race has increased turnout expectations and intensified fears of long lines at limited polling sites. In New York, newcomers Jamaal Bowman and Mondaire Jones are campaigning to replace the state's two longest-serving House members, Rep. Eliot Engel and Rep. Nita Lowey. And Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is also defending her seat.\nMeet the candidates trying to unseat Mitch McConnell 02:45\n3. Rayshard Brooks\nRayshard Brooks, the 27-year-old Black man who was shot and killed by an Atlanta police officer this month, will be laid to rest today. His family and friends will honor his life in a funeral service at the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. served as a co-pastor. King's daughter, the Rev. Bernice King, will speak at Brooks' funeral. The Rev. Raphael Warnock, senior pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church and a Democratic candidate for US Senate, will deliver the eulogy. Mourners paid their respects yesterday during a four-hour public viewing at the church. Today's private service will begin at 1 p.m. ET.\nBefore death, Rayshard Brooks shared his struggle for redemption 03:09\n4. Law enforcement\nThings are still tense between law enforcement and demonstrators protesting police brutality. Seattle's mayor told protesters who had taken over a police-free \"autonomous zone\" that it's time for them to go home. The demonstrators wouldn't be removed by force, she said, but the city would work with Black-led community organizations to persuade them to leave the area. In California, employees of a sheriff's and district attorney's office were among those arrested after multiple people were caught on a security camera vandalizing a Black Lives Matter sign, authorities said. And in Minneapolis, where ex-officer Derek Chauvin was charged with murder in the death of George Floyd, eight corrections officers at the jail where Chauvin is being held say they were briefly barred from his floor the day he was booked because of the color of their skin.\nCNN goes inside Seattle's autonomous zone 02:42\n5. Immigration\nThe Trump administration is once again barring immigrants from coming to the US -- this time through a number of new restrictions on visas for temporary foreign workers. A wide range of workers, from au pairs to software engineers, will be blocked from coming to the US until at least January, though there are exceptions. Trump's argument: The devastating economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic has forced officials to do more to protect American jobs. But immigrant rights advocates and tech companies that rely on the visa programs to bring in skilled workers aren't buying it. They accuse the Trump administration of using the crisis to further its immigration agenda and say the restrictions will ultimately hurt the economy.\nTrump: Immigration order to apply only to green cards 02:59\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\nJoel Schumacher, director of Batman movies and 'St. Elmo's Fire,' has died\nHe was best known for directing the divisive \"Batman Forever\" and \"Batman & Robin\" films in the '90s.\nSchumacher: 'Batman' is for the audience, not for me (1997) 00:59\nA package of smelly fruit sent 6 people to the hospital and caused an evacuation\nThat's one heck of a stench.\nApple wants your iPhone to replace your car keys\nGreat news for those of us who are always losing stuff.\nWidgets, face mask Memoji, car keys: Here's what's new on iOS 14 03:04\nWomen are less likely to swipe right on men posing with cats in their dating profiles\nBut do you really want to date someone who would swipe left on your sweet kitty?\nIf you're wondering whether signing that petition will change anything ...\nWell, it's complicated.\nTODAY'S QUOTE\n\"I wanted to show whoever it was that you're not going to take away my smile.

Aggravated assaults are unchanged from last year's total as of June 27, while reported rapes are down 59%.\nIn all, the total number of serious criminal incidents so far this year is far lower than in previous years.\nAs of June 27 in Atlanta, there have been about 9,500 incidents of those eight most serious offenses -- an 18% decrease from the same point in 2019 and a 22% decrease from the same point in 2018.\nSimilarly, as of the end of June, there were about 12,400 of these eight serious offenses in 2018, 12,200 in 2017, and 13,600 in 2016, according to Atlanta Police data. And all of these totals are well below crime numbers as of the end of June 2009, when there were 18,900 of these incidents.\nIn all, the data is broadly consistent with the nationwide decline in violent crime over the past several decades since its peak in the early 1990s.\nWhy are large cities seeing similar trends?\nThis trend is not specific to Atlanta, as New York City has similarly seen a rise in shootings and murders this year but a decline in most other crimes. New York Police Department officials have blamed the increases on the coronavirus pandemic and protests against police brutality, as well as issues specific to New York like state bail reform and a decline in incarceration at Rikers Island jail.\nGun violence surges in major American cities in the midst of a pandemic and a policing crisis\nCriminologists are still trying to understand why so many American cities have seen similar trends. A report commissioned by the Arnold Ventures philanthropy said homicide rates declined in April and May in most large US cities likely because of coronavirus business closures and stay-at-home orders.\n\"Homicides depend on relatively vibrant activity patterns -- lots of people on the street,\" Richard Rosenfeld, a University of Missouri-St. Louis professor and co-author of the report, told the philanthropy's newsletter. \"When the streets are empty, the opportunities for all kinds of street crime go down.\"\nThomas Abt, a senior fellow at the Council on Criminal Justice and the report's other author, told CNN last week that there appeared to be connection between violence and the \"legitimacy\" of the state and law enforcement.\n\"As legitimacy drops, the people in these communities simply don't use the criminal justice system to mediate conflicts and instead turn to violence,\" he told the newsletter.\n\"We saw a significant increase in homicides after the unrest in Ferguson, Baltimore, Chicago and other places. We may be in for the same thing in the wake of the George Floyd protests.\"\nCNN's Chris Boyette, Ray Sanchez, Brynn Gingras, Kate Conerly and Laura Dolan contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/08/us/pat-chambers-rasir-bolton-penn-state-basketball-noose-trnd/index.html", "headline": "Penn State basketball coach apologizes for 'noose' comment after a Black player shares that's why he transferred", "published_date": "2020-07-08", "text": "(CNN)Pat Chambers, head coach of the men's basketball team at Penn State, apologized Monday for comments he made in 2019 that led to the departure of then-freshman Rasir Bolton.\nIn a statement posted on Twitter this week, Bolton said he chose to leave Penn State following an exchange he had with the coach after a game between Penn State and Wisconsin in January 2019.\n\"A 'noose' around my neck is why I left Penn State,\" Bolton wrote in the tweet. \"Head Coach Patrick Chambers, the day after his one-game suspension in January 2019, in talking to me referenced a 'noose' around my neck.\" Chambers had been suspended for the January 6, 2019, game after shoving a freshman player during a timeout several days earlier.\nChambers had told Bolton he knew the player was under pressure. The team had lost and Bolton shot poorly. He said he wanted to be a stress-reliever for Bolton, according to an article by ESPN's The Undefeated.\n\"You can talk to me about anything.

In his lengthy statement, Bolton clarified why he left -- and noted he wanted to \"tell this story, because it is not alleged, it was admitted to and documented.\"\nBolton told The Undefeated that his decision to publicly share his experience at Penn State came after seeing Chambers was among several coaches participating in a National Association of Basketball Coaches virtual panel in June addressing racial injustice.

He said his parents also drove five hours to campus to meet with Chambers and people in the athletic director's office \"more than once.\"\n\"During this time, Coach Chambers admitted to what he said,\" according to Bolton.\nAs a result of discussing the noose comment, Bolton said he experienced \"subtle repercussions,\" including his teammates being told he \"couldn't be trusted.\"\nHe also \"was provided one meeting and a phone number to text with a psychologist. I was taught 'ways to deal with Coach Chambers' personality type.'\"\nIn May 2019, it was announced that Bolton was headed to Iowa.\nDuring his final player/coach meeting in April of last year, Bolton said Chambers issued yet another \"subtle insult\" -- this time directed toward his family.\n\"Coach Chambers told me he was 'really impressed with how well spoken and organized my parents were,'\" a comment that plays directly into stereotypes presuming low expectations for Black people.\nChambers told The Undefeated that he doesn't recall making the comment insulting Bolton's parents.\nUntil Monday, Chambers had never apologized, Bolton said. Penn State's Integrity Office reached out six months later, after Bolton had already left the school, to request a waiver.\nPenn State official responds\nWhen asked for comment, a spokesperson for Penn State referred CNN to Chambers' statement, as well as a statement posted by the school's Vice President for Intercollegiate Athletics Sandy Barbour.\nBarbour, whose statement was published on Twitter on Monday, detailed an action plan the athletics program intends to take to help the school \"move to a more inclusive, just and respectful environment.\"\n\"It's imperative that we all learn from the mistakes of our past -- our own and those of others,\" Barbour wrote.\nThe steps outlined in the plan include: listening by conducting an annual Intercollegiate Athletics climate survey; taking action by establishing an Intercollegiate Athletics Response Team \"to more effectively address issues of concerns, affecting the culture, climate and experience of the ... community\"; and a handful of other efforts, which Barbour described as \"just a start.\"\nChambers -- who has been Penn State's head coach since 2011 -- \"has stated that he is committed to educating himself and he is actively working to learn and grow, which will be imperative to his future success at Penn State,\" Barbour said.\n'I wasn't the first and I know I wasn't the last'\nBolton's statement, and Chambers' subsequent apology, come as protests in the US continue over the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and others. Their deaths reignited a movement for change.\nIn college sports specifically, Bolton is not the first to speak up against incidents of racism.\nLast month, Kerry Martin, Jr, a football player at West Virginia University, detailed the mistreatment he and others received from defensive coordinator Vic Koenning, who has now been placed on administrative leave while the school conducts an investigation. Koenning also apologized in a statement to Martin, writing that he never intended to be offensive or insensitive.\n\"I wasn't the first and I know I wasn't the last,\" Bolton, who is now 20, said of his experience with Chambers, adding that he believes changes need to be made \"in the way players are protected and helped across the country when faced with these situations.\"\n\"Surface level resources are not good enough,\" he wrote. \"In most cases it is the Coach who is protected, while the player is left to deal with it or leave.\"\nHe ended his statement urging others to \"BE the change you want to see.\""}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/23/us/protests-police-reform-women-policing-invs/index.html", "headline": "Want to reform the police? Hire more women", "published_date": "2020-06-23", "text": "(CNN)It was a moment that captured national attention and revealed an important lesson about police reform.\nA Fort Lauderdale, Florida, policeman, facing off against a line of yelling demonstrators, sticks his finger in the face of a protester. He then turns toward a kneeling woman, her hands raised in protest. The officer suddenly lunges and shoves her.\nThen, a female officer appears. She swats her male colleague back toward a line of patrol cars, waving her arm and appearing to upbraid him for what he did.\n\"Thank you!\" a protester shouts at Officer Krystle Smith, who won praise for her actions on social media and from police leaders around the country.\nNeither Smith nor Officer Steven Pohorence, who is suspended pending an outside investigation, were allowed to comment on the incident.\n\"I was proud of her,\" said Ivonne Roman, the former police chief in Newark, New Jersey, who has been fighting for years to push her profession to hire more women. \"That is why we need more women in policing. Statistically, they do not escalate; they de-escalate.\"\n\nAs protests over the police killing of George Floyd have refocused national attention on police abuses and use of force, law enforcement experts and leaders say one powerful reform would be simple: Hire more women.\nWomen make up only about one out of every eight sworn police officers nationwide, according to federal statistics.\nA female officer is seen while protests continued over the death of George Floyd in Brooklyn on June 6, 2020.\nLaw enforcement agencies do not recruit, retain or promote women at the same rate they do men -- even though research suggests that if they did, the nation would see far fewer tragedies like the killings of Floyd, Laquan McDonald or Eric Garner.\nResearch has shown that women cops are less likely to face sustained allegations of excessive force than their male colleagues, and that women officers cost cities less in civil lawsuit settlements for such incidents and are the subject of fewer citizen complaints. Another study found that women police injure suspects less.\nWhen it comes to routine use of force, studies have come to varying conclusions about whether gender is a factor. CNN analyzed data from four of the few metropolitan police departments that publish data about the gender of the officers involved in use of force incidents. In all four cities -- Cincinnati, Indianapolis, New Orleans and Orlando -- female officers were involved in a smaller percentage of incidents than their share of the department.\nBut more than a dozen experienced cops, law enforcement professionals and researchers told CNN that women in police departments face obstacles, from fitness tests that emphasize brawn over people skills, to pervasive harassment from some male colleagues.\nA female police officer uses police tape to cordon off an area outside a restaurant in Hollywood, California, in January 2017.\n\"Policing -- everyday policing -- is about social services: domestic violence cases, dealing with people's mental health problems, getting victims to open up, negotiating,\" said Maureen McGough, the Chief of Staff for the Policing Project at New York University Law School. \"But recruitment ads you see for police are still using that macho guy with a gun. And the physical fitness tests to get into the police academy still favor upper body strength, something that has nothing to do with how good a cop you're going to be.\"\nIf the United States is serious about police reform, experts said, then law enforcement has to finally make equal room and opportunity for women.\n\"Policing as an institution was constructed and run by men, so the system in which we are still operating, what we value, the people we recruit, it still reflects that male culture,\" McGough said. \"I don't think most Americans understand that.\"\nHow women handle policing\nFor at least two decades, the percentage of women serving as officers in local police departments has slightly increased to around 12%. There are even fewer women in police leadership: In 2016, the most recent year for which national data is available, less than 3% of chiefs and 10% of first-line supervisors were women, according to the federal government-run Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics survey.\nAmong 20 of the largest 25 police departments in the country that provided data to CNN, the percentage of sworn women officers ranges from 10.6% in San Antonio to 25.2% in Detroit. Large metro law enforcement agencies tend to have higher rates of women officers than small local departments, many of which employ no women, according to federal data.\nIn several other western democracies, officers are far more likely to be women than in the United States. Recent figures show women represent more than a third of police in Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. In England, Wales and Australia, women make up over 30% of police; in Canada 22%.\nThirty years of research suggests that the dearth of American women with a badge could be exacerbating excessive use of police force.\nWe offer several ways to reach our journalists securely.\nWomen officers are the subject of fewer citizen complaints and sustained allegations of excessive force than their male colleagues, according to a study in 2002. That research, considered by experts to be a landmark look at the differences between genders in policing, also shows that women cost municipalities and agencies less money in civil liability payouts compared to men. The latter finding has been supported by additional research that shows women use less force and local investigations examining lawsuits. In Minneapolis, for example, only three of more than 50 officer conduct lawsuits settled between 2010 and 2014 involved women accused of excessive force, a Minnesota Public Radio investigation found.\nResearch also indicates that when male officers are paired with female officers, they use less force, and women paired with each other are the least likely to use extreme force. While 30% of male officers have fired their weapon while on duty, only 11% of female officers have, a 2017 Pew Research Center survey found.\nWhile every person is different, women generally tend to be socialized to talk rather than shout, negotiate rather than bully and empathize rather than order, police leaders and researchers said.\nA female police officer and others process the scene of a shooting in Grand Forks, North Dakota, on May 27, 2020.\n\"I was on the street for many years, involved in all kinds of critical incidents, and force was never my first response,\" said Jane\u00e9 Harteau, who served as the Minneapolis police chief between 2012 and 2017. \"I would much rather not fight my way out of a situation. I'll do it if I have to, but if I can get the cuffs on and we're done, great.\"\n\"Women invented de-escalation,\" Harteau said. \"It's called communication.\"\nOn the long list of high-profile police killings that have sparked protests around the country, the vast majority of officers accused are male -- from Derek Chauvin in Minneapolis to Darren Wilson in Ferguson to Daniel Pantaleo in New York.\nOne of the few fatal incidents involving a woman officer that received national attention in recent years was the 2018 killing of Botham Jean, a Black man who was shot in his apartment in Dallas by Officer Amber Guyger, who said she thought she was entering her own apartment. Guyger is serving a 10-year prison sentence after being convicted of Jean's murder last year.\nWhat the data reveals\nCNN's analysis of data from four cities supports the idea that women officers use less force. Women officers in Orlando carried out 8% of the uses of force between 2009 and May 2019, while they make up 17% of the department. In Cincinnati, women officers carried out 13% of episodes of use of force from 2000 through September 2018, while they currently comprise 23% of the total officers.\nIn Indianapolis, women officers carried out 9% of uses of force from 2014 through last month, while they currently make up 13% of the officers.\u202fAnd in New Orleans, women officers carried out 10% of uses of force from 2016 through November 2019. They made up 22.5% of the department in 2016, the latest year for which federal data is available.\nHonolulu Police Chief Susan Ballard, middle, looks up as Honolulu Fire Department and HPD helicopters drop flowers onto a procession for police Officer Tiffany-Victoria Enriquez on January 30, 2020.\nThere's also some evidence that women officers used more serious force at lower levels than their male colleagues. For example, in New Orleans, which ranks use of force in four levels by seriousness, women carried out just 7.5% of police uses of force at the highest level, which include discharging their firearm, putting someone in a neck hold or striking a handcuffed suspect.\nWomen in policing tend to have different skillsets, said Liana Perez, the director of operations for NACOLE, a national group of civilian police oversight agencies.\n\"Sometimes they benefit from de-escalation skills or the ability to talk people down,\" Perez, who previously worked as the independent police auditor for the city of Tucson, said. \"And on the flip side, for the most part, suspects or individuals they are encountering are less likely to get into a physical confrontation with a woman than with a man.\"\nWhere are the women?\nPolice departments face two problems in increasing the number of women with a badge: Recruiting them and keeping them on the force.\nThat starts, experts said, with the way some departments advertise for new recruits -- with commercials that predominantly feature men and deliver a more \"Die Hard\" than \"Officer Friendly\" image of policing -- guns blazing, men repelling down buildings, and high-octane car chases.\nAds that highlight big guns and militaristic standoffs have been used to recruit new officers in cities from Alexandria, Louisiana to Brunswick, Georgia to Melbourne, Florida, and even places like Palo Alto, California -- a wealthy Silicon Valley suburb that had 90 incidents of violent crime in 2017, the year the ad was released.\nIn Gainesville, Florida, the police chief stopped using a 2014 recruitment ad that depicted scene after scene of men shooting guns over heavy metal music, a spokesman said, because he decided it didn't represent day-to-day police work. Though the department stopped linking to it on its website and airing it locally in the fall of 2015, it remained on the agency's YouTube channel until a CNN reporter asked the department about it last week.\nNYPD officer suspended after apparent chokehold incident 01:26\nFemale recruits also face barriers in passing fitness tests that are still required for many police departments around the country.\nIn New Jersey, about a third of female recruits (31%) failed the state police academy's fitness test in 2017, while only 2% of male recruits did, according to an investigation by the Asbury Park Press and USA Today Network. In Colorado Springs, a federal judge ruled in 2017 that the local police department's fitness test discriminated against women, leading the department to stop using the test and awarding the 12 plaintiffs a more than $2.4 million settlement. Half of female recruits failed that test, while only 6% of male recruits did, according to the judge's ruling.\nBut experts say most police work is based more on interpersonal skills than upper body strength, and that those tests can arbitrarily make it more difficult for women to succeed.\nSome departments have already started to reform fitness tests. In Texas, the state Department of Public Safety released a model policy that replaces tests involving push-ups, running, or pull-ups with a single rowing test that has differing requirements based on age, gender and weight. Several cities like Austin have adopted it.\nHowever, even cities that have reformed their testing can still have biased recruiting processes. When Lt. Eve Stephens started a new role at the Austin department handling personnel, she realized how few women were graduating from the department's police academy. Only 11% of the officers in Austin are female, one of the lowest percentages among the largest metro departments.\nStephens discovered several male academy instructors second-guessing them when they tried to use de-escalation tactics in their role playing exercises, she said. A recruit reported that an instructor told her that he was going to make it \"his job\" that she not graduate, Stephens told CNN. Another recruit, a stay-at-home mother, told Stephens that a male instructor told her, \"are you even ready for this?\"\nWhat would the US look like without police? 02:17\nStephens said she successfully pushed for both instructors to be transferred from the academy.\n\"I just thought, 'Where the hell are all the women?'\" said Stephens, who started a mentoring program for female recruits in 2018. \"We were recruiting a lot of women and a lot of women started at the academy, but attrition was twice that of the men.\"\nThe Austin Police Department did not respond to the instances described by Stephens about academy instructors, but in a statement said it holds recruiting sessions focused on women where applicants can talk with women officers. Any incidents of inappropriate comments or behavior are prohibited, the department said, and if they are substantiated, the offending person will be reprimanded and could be fired.\n'Here, kitty, kitty': What moving up the ranks can feel like\nOnce women become police officers, another huge barrier to keeping them in the profession is the treatment some face from their own male colleagues.\nWhen Harteau started her policing career in Minneapolis in the late 1980s, she said, officers would regularly make sexually suggestive comments to her. \"I could handle that,\" she said.\nFormer Minneapolis Police Chief Janee Harteau speaks at a news conference in December 2015.\nBut the harassment Harteau and her female partner faced escalated. Their patrol car was vandalized, she said, and property that should have gone to the evidence room mysteriously wound up in their car. Officers \"consistently\" wouldn't respond to their calls for backup, she said.\n\"One time we had a chase with a stolen car and the guy bails, and I'm trying to air a description, and one of the guys gets on the radio and starts saying, 'Here, kitty, kitty,'\" Harteau recalled. \"It was degrading.\"\nThe Internal Affairs department didn't take their complaints seriously, Harteau said, so she and her partner filed a discrimination and hostile work environment complaint with the state Department of Human Rights, which they won. The police department referred a request for comment about the case to the City Attorney's Office, which declined to comment, and the state department did not respond to a request for comment.\nDemonstrators say public safety re-imagined is a future without police\nHarteau had a choice: Quit or keep her badge and press on. She rose to chief \"because I never went away,\" she said. And even as chief, she faced second-guessing from the male-dominated department when she tried to promote more women, she said.\nHarteau resigned at the mayor's request in 2017 after an officer shot and killed a woman who had called 911 to report a rape. The officer was convicted of murder and manslaughter. There had been another controversial police shooting during her tenure.\nBut Harteau also tried to improve the department. Twice she brought in the US Department of Justice to review police practices. Those efforts, she said, resulted in the police creating a better system to track officer complaints and staff getting training on how to interact with protesters.\n\"Throughout my career I have always done considerable self-reflection, evaluating what I do,\" she said. \"Every day did I do my best? Probably not. Some days you are stronger and can get more accomplished, but did I make things better than when I [started]? I think so.\"\nThere's no playbook for the battle between mayors and police right now\nAbout 14% of Minneapolis officers are female, according to the department.\nMore than 30 women officers from across the country shared similar stories with Natalie Todak, a University of Alabama criminology assistant professor. She interviewed women who've been promoted to elite police units such as bomb squads or SWAT teams. Their male colleagues told them things like the unit had been \"pussified\" since they joined, Todak said.\nThe women in the study are promised anonymity, Todak said, because to speak publicly about their harassment \"would turn a woman into a pariah\" and threaten her career.\nInstead, she said, they find ways to cope. They use humor. They keep their head down.\nThat is what Wendy Stiver tried to do. At Dayton Police Department, where she worked for more than two decades, someone once left a feminine hygiene product affixed to an evidence slip on the windshield of the cruiser she shared with another female officer, she said.\nEven after she rose to major, the sexist antics continued: A male sergeant's name plate was placed on the woman's bathroom door, she said, and a feminine hygiene product was stuck on another male sergeant's door.\n\"They're making these locker room jokes,\" said Stiver, who now works as an executive with the Charleston, South Carolina, police department. \"That was the locker room culture.\"\nStiver said she never reported these incidents because she did not believe it would result in change. A Dayton police spokeswoman said the agency can't verify those alleged incidents happened since they were not reported, adding that the department is trying to create a culture \"inclusive of all people.\"\nHow police departments can do better\nPolice leaders say departments are making more of an effort to increase the number of women in their ranks now than ever before -- and the protests over Floyd's death show how important that work is.\nRoman, the former Newark chief, said she and other law enforcement professionals are fighting for what she's calling \"30 by 30 Initiative,\" the ambitious goal of raising the percentage of female representation in law enforcement to 30% by 2030.\nAnd it's not just female police chiefs who are taking gender disparities seriously. Luther Reynolds, the police chief in Charleston, South Carolina, said recruiting women is one of his top priorities, and he recently removed or reassigned officers who had questioned his decision to promote a young female lieutenant.\n\"Some of the women I policed with I felt safer with, because they had patience, empathy... they knew how to talk to people,\" Reynolds said. \"Maybe they didn't bench press 300 pounds, but they had other skills to navigate really gnarly situations.\"\nIn Houston, Police Chief Art Acevedo said he has made a point of promoting more women. Now, just over half of the department's assistant chiefs and division commanders are female.\nThose leaders are \"not placed there just because they're a woman -- it's because they're damn good,\" Acevedo said. \"It doesn't require testosterone to do the job.\"\nHow we reported this story\nTo study use of force by female officers, CNN analyzed public use of force data from four departments that include officers' gender in their databases: Cincinnati, Indianapolis, New Orleans and Orlando.\nNone of the databases appear to include fatal uses of force. The data for Cincinnati, Indianapolis and New Orleans included each individual use of force by an officer against each individual suspect -- so if one officer pointed their gun at three suspects in one incident, that could be counted as three uses of force. For the Orlando data, incidents were counted separately, so each officer counted may have used force against multiple people.\nCorrection: This story was corrected to reflect that Janee Harteau's policing career began in the 1980s, not 1990s."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/02/us/police-unions-contracts-shielding-bad-cops-invs/index.html", "headline": "Police unions have helped shield officers from accountability.

Others put limits on internal investigations, give officers advance notice for interrogations or require the city to pay if officers are held liable for misconduct in court.\nRushin, who analyzed more than 650 police union contracts around the country, found in a 2019 paper that more than two thirds of the contracts forced police departments to go through an appeals process when they wanted to fire or discipline officers, placing the final decisions in the hands of arbitrators \"selected, in part, by the local police union or the aggrieved officer.\"\nThat means that even if those cities approve tough new regulations about use of force, for example, it could be hard to jettison cops who don't follow the rules.\nThose disciplinary procedures are negotiated in the contract bargaining process at the same time as issues like salaries, wages and benefits for officers, Rushin said.\n\"Particularly in budget-strapped cities, when officials can't meet the financial demands of the union, the concession they're ultimately forced to make is on discipline,\" Rushin said. \"They can bury the disciplinary measures in the contract, and the public may not understand what it means, even as the monetary savings make the headlines.\"\nPolice unions stand in the way of lasting reform\nAcross the country, union-negotiated disciplinary procedures help keep officers with problematic records on the job. In Minneapolis, for example, only about 1.5% of complaints filed against officers resulted in suspensions, terminations or demotions between 2013 and 2019, according to a CNN analysis of data from the city's Office of Police Conduct Review.\nOfficers even have been rehired after being fired for high-profile fatal shootings. In Miami, an arbitrator in 2014 ordered the police department to reinstate detective Reynaldo Goyos, who fatally shot an unarmed man in a shooting that a department review board ruled was \"unjustified.\" And in Oakland, officer Hector Jimenez won his job back in arbitration in 2011 after being fired for fatally shooting two unarmed men in separate incidents within a year, shooting one in the back.\nSome research has suggested a relationship between law enforcement collective bargaining and misconduct. A University of Chicago study found that misconduct complaints against Florida sheriff's deputies increased after they won the right to collectively bargain in 2003.\nPolice union leaders say the discipline rules they've won in contract negotiations are important to guarantee their members due process, and that officers deserve strong protections due to the danger and unpredictability of their jobs.\nPolice unions dig in as calls for reform grow\n\"Police officers are under attack, and I think you're going to see less people sign up for the job,\" said Jeff Roorda, executive director of the St. Louis Police Officers Association, which successfully stymied an attempt by the local district attorney to form an independent unit to probe police misconduct. \"What we do is defend police officers' due process rights, the same rights every American has.\"\nBut other experts argue that police contracts are so favorable for officers largely because of the political power of unions and their influence among local elected officials.\n\"Police unions have much more protection than other government or other public unions,\" said L. Song Richardson, dean of the law school at the University of California, Irvine.\nIn several cities, officers have elected more bombastic leaders in recent years, thrusting their unions into culture war battles and strongly opposing reforms.\nPresident Donald Trump shakes hands with Minneapolis Police Union head Bob Kroll on stage during a campaign rally at the Target Center on October 10, 2019 in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\nIn Minneapolis, union president Bob Kroll has called the protests over Floyd's death a \"terrorist movement,\" maligned Floyd for having a \"violent criminal history,\" and bragged that none of the three police shootings he's been involved in has bothered him.\nAnd in Chicago, officers in May elected a new president, John Catanzara, who is one the most frequently-disciplined officers in the history of the department, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. Even as he took office leading the city's cops, Catanzara had been stripped of his own police powers, limiting when he can carry his gun and badge. The department is investigating him for filing a false or misleading police report against a former superintendent after Catanzara accused the superintendent of allowing protesters to block a highway in 2018.\nCatanzara has previously been reprimanded and investigated for social media posts supporting President Donald Trump, which violated rules about officers making political statements on the job. And last month, Catanzara declared that any officer who kneeled in support of protesters while in their uniform could be kicked out of the union.\nA spokeswoman for Catanzara declined an interview request from CNN, and Kroll did not respond to a request for comment.\nWhy fired cops get hired again\nPolicing experts say that San Antonio's union-negotiated contract is among the most favorable for a police union.\nTexas law puts final decisions about officer discipline in the hands of arbitrators chosen in agreement between cities and unions and, in most cases, blocks the department from imposing discipline for any incident that took place more than 180 days earlier. San Antonio's contract with the San Antonio Police Officers Association goes farther, limiting past incidents arbitrators can take into account when deciding whether to uphold punishments.\nTexas man gets emotional remembering police confrontation 07:35\nOther provisions in the contract restrict interrogations of officers during internal affairs investigations and, in some cases, allow cops to avoid a suspension of up to 45 days if they forfeit accumulated vacation, bonus time or holiday leave.\nOf 24 officer terminations since 2010 that were ruled on by arbitrators, 10 were overturned, or about 42%, according to the department's data, which was first reported by the San Antonio Express-News.\nIn 12 other termination cases, officers resigned or retired before the case went before an arbitrator, and in 20 other cases the chief settled with officers, allowing them to come back with a reduced punishment. Those settlements often come at the advice of the department's lawyers, and some are entered into because of the likelihood an arbitrator would overturn a termination, a SAPD spokesman said.\nOut of 81 police contracts analyzed by Campaign Zero, San Antonio's is one of just six that contain language limiting accountability in all of the areas the group tracked. Rushin's analysis also found it to be \"one of the most deferential to law enforcement interests,\" he said.\nThe contract was approved by an 8-2 majority on the city council in 2016, over objections from local activists, who said the discipline language made it a sweetheart deal for police.\nAccording to Texas campaign finance data, the San Antonio union's political action committee has spent more than $2.3 million since 2010, including more than $300,000 in direct contributions to political candidates. The group had previously made donations to half of the city council members who voted for the 2016 contract, as well as the mayor who negotiated it.\nWilliam McManus, the police chief, called the contract's limits on discipline frustrating.\n\"To have an arbitrator undermine the chief's authority to determine what is best for their department and their community contributes to the notion that there is no police accountability,\" he said in a statement.\nBut union president Mike Helle said the process defended officers from being subject to the chief's \"whims.\"\n\"There's nobody on this police department that wants a policeman that's bad because it tarnishes all of us,\" Helle told CNN. \"The only thing that we have negotiated for and we continue to hope for is that we just have a fair process.\"\nThe bad cops 'need to be off the street'\nOver the years, San Antonio arbitrators have overturned terminations for eyebrow-raising examples of misconduct, even when none of the facts were in dispute.\nIn July 2018 body camera audio captured Officer Tim Garcia repeatedly using the n-word as he arrested a Black man for trespassing at a local mall. A review board recommended Garcia be fired, and McManus moved to \"indefinitely suspend\" him from the force.\nAt Garcia's disciplinary hearing in 2019, McManus called his behavior \"the most inappropriate language I have ever heard used during an arrest,\" according to arbitration records. But the arbitrator, Thomas Cipolla, disagreed with the punishment, reducing Garcia's sentence to a 10-month unpaid suspension and sending him back to the force.\n\"One diatribe does not automatically denote a racist,\" Cipolla wrote in the ruling. \"I find myself coming to the conclusion that (Garcia) was off that day and said some awful things he should not have said and is now sorry for them.\"\nGarcia, who is still on the force, declined to comment through a police spokesman, but the union has vocally defended him, with Helle telling the Express-News last month that using the n-word was as offensive as Mayor Nirenberg using the word \"goddamn\" in a recent speech about police violence.\n\"Throughout anybody's career, they're gonna make mistakes,\" Helle told CNN, saying Garcia \"couldn't apologize more.\"\nOther officers had their terminations overturned after bizarre behavior. Officer Matthew Belver was fired in 2016 after a dashboard camera captured him removing an arrestee's handcuffs and making him an offer: If he beat him in a fight, he could go free. The arrestee declined.\nIn arguing for Belver's termination, the department pointed to another 2010 incident in which he allegedly challenged another arrestee to a fight and then punched him in the face. But the police contract negotiated by the union bars the department from invoking years-old cases to justify firings, except under certain circumstances -- a provision the arbitrator noted in his decision reducing the 2016 firing to a 45-day unpaid suspension. Belver, who declined to comment, is still on the force but is required to ride with a partner at all times, a department spokesman said.\nPolice chief to Trump: Please, keep your mouth shut if you can't be constructive 03:06\nOfficer Matthew Luckhurst was fired in 2016 after admitting he put dog feces between a slice of bread and left it near a homeless man. The man didn't eat it, but another officer testified that Luckhurst had later spread rumors that he force-fed the man the sandwich, according to the arbitration ruling, and the chief concluded his behavior was \"inhumane.\"\nThe arbitrator reduced Luckhurst's punishment to a five-day suspension because it took the chief more than 180 days to impose discipline in the case. But Luckhurst was fired again just a few weeks after his first termination for another poop-related incident: smearing a brown \"boba tea smoothie\" on the seat of the only toilet in the women's locker room of a police station, according to arbitration documents. That decision was upheld by an arbitrator last month. Luckhurst did not respond to a request for comment.\nWhat police chief says to do if you see police brutality 01:35\nSome officers have faced termination only to be returned to the force again and again. One lieutenant, Lee Rakun, was fired six times over his more than two-decade career at the department for offenses ranging from racist statements to dating violence allegations, CNN affiliate KSAT and the Express-News reported.\u202fAgain and again, the chief settled to bring him back or an arbitrator reinstated him.\nRakun retired from the force earlier this year as part of his last disciplinary settlement, the department said. In a text message, Rakun declined to comment on his disciplinary record but argued that the union's contracts were fair and noted that \"many of these city officials clamoring for 'police reform' likely have their signatures on these agreements time after time.\"\nIn other cases, the police chief reversed his own decision to terminate officers while facing pressure from the union and the prospect of being overturned by an arbitrator.\nIn February 2016 Officer John Lee shot and killed Antronie Scott, an unarmed Black man, after mistaking the cell phone he was holding for a gun. McManus initially moved to suspend Lee indefinitely.\nTwo weeks later the police union began voting on a \"no confidence\" motion against McManus. The same day, KSAT reported, McManus changed his mind and allowed Lee to return to the force after additional training. A department spokesman said the chief's reversal was not in response to the no confidence vote but was \"made to afford (Lee) due process with respect to his rights under the collective bargaining agreement.\"\nDemocrats team for effort to end doctrine shielding police as GOP backs off\nLee never faced criminal charges over the shooting. Scott's widow and mother sued the city and Lee, and the case is ongoing.\u202fLee resigned from the department in February, and a lawyer representing him did not respond to a request for comment. In court documents, Lee's attorney has argued that he is protected by qualified immunity, a legal protection that is often used to block lawsuits against police officers.\nThe city's police contract expires next year. Gregory Hudspeth, the president of the local San Antonio NAACP branch, said that most San Antonians didn't seem to pay much attention to the contract when it was negotiated four years ago -- but that he and other activists were preparing to shine a stronger spotlight on the issue during the upcoming negotiations.\n\"The bad officers need to be off the street, or we're going to have an incident like the George Floyd case here,\" he said. The current arbitration system, Hudspeth said, seems to be designed to \"wait until an officer causes someone's death before they say it's worth terminating him.\"\nWhat's happening now to improve police accountability\nAs anger has grown over police use of force in recent weeks, some cities are chipping away at police unions' bargaining and political powers.\nIn Minneapolis, chief Medaria Arradondo announced last month he was withdrawing from contract negotiations with the union. Washington, D.C., passed a new ordinance removing disciplinary rules from the scope of collective bargaining. And Chicago put in place new reforms allowing anonymous complaints in a contract with police supervisors signed last week.\nThe Black Lives Matter protests preview the politics of a diversifying America\nDozens of elected officials around the country have also signed onto a national pledge to reject donations from the Fraternal Order of Police, a national police union affiliated with many of the largest local police unions. In Austin, for example, the mayor and all 10 members of the city council said last month they would not accept contributions from the local police union.\nSome other labor groups are moving to distance themselves from police unions. In Seattle, a county labor council voted to expel the city's police union from its membership last month, saying the union wasn't \"actively working to dismantle racism in their institution and society at large.\" The union responded in a statement that the decision \"should sound the alarm to other public safety labor unions across our region, state and nation that they're next.\"\nNationally, the board of labor giant AFL-CIO called last month for the resignation of Kroll and supported the Seattle group. But the union's board said it would not cut ties with police unions it is affiliated with, arguing in a statement that \"police officers, and everyone who works for a living, have the right to collective bargaining.\"\n\"We believe the best way to use our influence on the issue of police brutality is to engage our police affiliates rather than isolate them,\" the board wrote.\nIn the wake of the backlash, some police unions are moving to propose their own reforms to the profession -- a possible bid to head off more sweeping changes.\nThe police unions of Los Angeles, San Jose and San Francisco released a national reform plan last month laying out proposals like a database of officers fired for gross misconduct, a use of force standard that emphasizes de-escalation and more broadly available data on police use of force.\n\"No words can convey our collective disgust and sorrow for the murder of George Floyd,\" the unions wrote in a newspaper ad announcing the proposals. \"We have an obligation as a profession and as human beings to express our sorrow by taking action.\"\nBut local activists say their suggestions don't go far enough.\n\"They're just trying to be pre-emptive before communities come up with something more restrictive to them,\" Neva Walker, executive director of a San Francisco community organizing group, said of the California unions. \"It's not about the individual officers -- it's about changing the whole system.\"\nCNN's Yahya Abou-Ghazala contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/26/us/elijah-mcclain-colorado-investigation-almost-a-year/index.html", "headline": "Elijah McClain's family is getting the investigation into his death they have been seeking for almost a year", "published_date": "2020-06-26", "text": "(CNN)When Colorado Gov.

Crickets,\" an attorney for the McClain family, Mari Newman, told CNN's Don Lemon Thursday.\nThe investigation into the 2019 death of Elijah McClain follows recent social media outcry and a petition signed by more than 2 million people. McClain's death is one of several cases to receive renewed scrutiny following the police killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and others in incidents sparking massive protests across the country.\n\"Why did it take almost a year, international media attention, millions of people signing a petition for a responsible adult to finally step up and do what should have happened right from the outset?\" Newman said.\nAttorney General Phil Weiser will now investigate the death of Elijah McClain at the governor's order. The city of Aurora, a suburb of Denver, is planning a separate investigation into the actions of first responders in the case.\nMcClain's arrest and subsequent death\nOn August 24, 2019, McClain was stopped by three White officers as he walked home from a convenience store, after a 911 caller described a \"suspicious person,\" according to a police overview of the incident. McClain resisted officer contact, the report says, and a struggle ensued. On one of the officers' body cameras, McClain is heard saying, \"I'm an introvert, please respect the boundaries that I am speaking.\"\nBodycam video shows McClain telling officers that he was trying to stop his music to listen to them, then they begin to arrest him. One officer is heard telling another, \"He just grabbed your gun, dude.\"\nThe video shows an officer wrestling McClain to the ground.\nWhen it comes to policing the police, strong watchdogs are the exception\nAt one point during the struggle, an officer is heard telling McClain, \"If you keep messing around, I'm going to bring my dog out and he's going to dog bite you.\"\nAn officer placed McClain in a carotid hold, or chokehold, and he briefly lost consciousness, according to an overview of the incident provided by police. They released the hold, the report says, and he began struggling again. When paramedics arrived at the scene, they administered the drug ketamine to sedate McClain, the report said. According to a letter from the district attorney, McClain suffered a heart attack while in the ambulance, and he was declared brain dead three days later.\nAn autopsy did not determine a cause of death but listed intense physical exertion and a narrow left coronary artery as contributing factors, according to the police overview. The coroner found the amount of ketamine in his system to be a therapeutic amount.\nIn February this year, a police review board declared, \"[t]he force applied during the altercation to include the carotid control hold and the force applied during the altercation was within policy and consistent with training.\"\nThe officers in the case were placed on administrative leave following McClain's death, but were later reinstated after prosecutors declined to file charges against them.\nCNN has contacted the Fraternal Order of the Police in Aurora for comment but has not received a reply yet.\nWhy it wasn't prosecuted\nAt the time of the incident, the Adams County district attorney Dave Young declined to file criminal charges against the officers.\nYoung told CNN's Chris Cuomo Thursday that the amount of evidence in the case was a factor in not prosecuting.\nColorado governor signs bill mandating police body cameras and banning chokeholds\n\"I'm not here to condone their actions -- in fact, I disagree with what they did on the night of August 24, 2019,\" Young said. But, he said, the forensic autopsy report could not determine McClain's cause of death.\n\"That's the question we don't know, and in my business, I can't take a case to court that we don't know the answers to those questions,\" he told Cuomo. \"I cannot take a case to the jury where I don't know what the cause of death is on a homicide case.\"\nNewman called that autopsy report ridiculous.\n\"The autopsy was attended by two members of the Aurora police department, two members of the district attorney's office, and it bends over backwards to say everything except for the truth,\" Newman told Lemon.\nAnd Newman attributed lack of evidence to the officers dislodging their body cameras, which she believed to be intentional. All three came off when the officers tackled McClain, and at three different times in the video, people were told to remove or turn off the cameras, she said.\nNew legislation and the possibility of prosecution\nWith the current public outcry, new charges could be filed in connection with McClain's death.\nPolis announced Thursday that he signed an executive order designating Attorney General Weiser to investigate the death of McClain.\n\"Elijah McClain should be alive today, and we owe it to his family to take this step and elevate the pursuit of justice in his name to a statewide concern,\" Polis said in the release.\nPolis said Weiser would criminally prosecute individuals if the facts support such action.\nThe race-related things that have changed since protests began around George Floyd's death\n\"He was an angel among humans,\" Newman said of McClain. \"He would go to play his violin on lunch hour to animals who were waiting to be adopted so they wouldn't be lonely.\"\nIn his statement Thursday, Polis said he was moved \"by speaking with Elijah's mother and her description of her son as a responsible and curious child who became a vegetarian to be healthier, and who could inspire the darkest soul.\"\nOn Friday, Polis also signed new police accountability legislation into law.\nThe Enhance Law Enforcement Integrity Act mandates body cameras, requires public reporting on policing, prevents rehiring of \"bad actors,\" holds individual officers liable for their actions, restricts the use of chemical agents and projectiles, and establishes that officers can only use deadly force when there is an imminent risk of danger to human life if apprehension is delayed, according to a joint press release from the General Assembly Democrats last week.\nThe legislation also repeals an officer's authority to use chokeholds and other dangerous tactics, the release said."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/21/us/robert-e-lee-connie-bernard-baton-rouge-trnd/index.html", "headline": "Baton Rouge activist rips school board member for defending Robert E.

Lee's history as a slave owner\nThe statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee stands behind a crowd of hundreds of White nationalists, neo-Nazis and members of the \"alt-right\" during the \"Unite the Right\" rally August 12, 2017, in Charlottesville, Virginia.\nLee personally owned enslaved people and he assumed command of 189 others after his father-in-law died in 1857, according to the American Civil War Museum.\nThe father-in-law's will stipulated that the enslaved people be freed within five years, but Lee petitioned state courts to extend his control over them, the museum states. State courts denied his petitions, and Lee officially freed the enslaved people on December 29, 1862 -- just days before the Emancipation Proclamation.\nLee also punished escape attempts harshly. In 1859, he ordered the whipping of three enslaved people who tried to escape, according to an 1866 account by Wesley Norris.\n\"Gen. Lee, in the meantime, stood by, and frequently enjoined (a county constable) to lay it on well, an injunction which he did not fail to heed; not satisfied with simply lacerating our naked flesh, Gen. Lee then ordered the overseer to thoroughly wash our backs with brine, which was done,\" Norris said in the account.\nOn Facebook last week, Lanus asked Bernard to more closely look into this history.\n\"I say to you Ms. Bernard that Robert E. Lee is not a man to be honored by our students, especially students of color!\" he wrote. \"To force our students to attend a school with such a name is not only degrading but it is culturally insensitive and a violation of our students' rights!\"\nNAACP Baton Rouge leaders similarly said the school's renaming was long overdue.\n\"The naming of schools after Confederate heroes is rooted in history -- a history of intimidation, degradation, and racism against Black people in America,\" they wrote.\n\"To move forward, we must honestly acknowledge the failings of the past and listen to those who feel marginalized.\""}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/16/us/rayshard-brooks-atlanta-shooting-tuesday/index.html", "headline": "A black sheriff says the police shooting of Rayshard Brooks was 'justified.'

It belonged to Derek Chauvin -- a familiar name.\n\"When I saw the name I said, 'Oh, him,'\" Gross told CNN. \"When you start to see those same officers over and over again with multiple complaints, their names lodge in your brain.\"\nGross, of the non-profit Communities United Against Police Brutality, argues that Chauvin -- who had 18 prior complaints filed against him and received reprimands for only two of them -- exemplifies the way problematic officers repeatedly thwart accountability in Minneapolis.\nMinneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo outlined a vision for change at a press conference on Wednesday, saying that he was withdrawing from contract negotiations with the police union, which he suggested has constrained reform. The city's own data shows how rare disciplinary action has been for years within the department that Arradondo and other reform-minded chiefs have headed.\nMinneapolis police chief says George Floyd's family will inspire his reform efforts\nOnly about 1.5% of complaints filed against Minneapolis police have resulted in suspensions, terminations or demotions between 2013 and 2019, according to a CNN analysis of data from the city's Office of Police Conduct Review, which investigates complaints. That office, which is separate from the police department but works with officers to resolve complaints, received about 2,013 complaints against police within its jurisdiction in that time.\nIf complaints that garnered letters of reprimand are included, that rate of discipline rises to about 2.6%.\nWhile no national data exists on the outcome of police complaints filed across the country, former law enforcement officials and oversight organizations agreed that the ratio of complaints filed to officers disciplined in Minneapolis seems low.\nLiana Perez, the director of operations for the National Association for Civilian Oversight of Law Enforcement, an organization whose members include police oversight agencies, said percentages vary widely between departments, which use different metrics, but that the average \"sustain rate\" for complaints is usually between 5 and 10%.\nAndrew Hawkins, of the Minneapolis Department of Civil Rights, which houses the conduct review office, said a majority of complaints against officers allege lower-level violations that are not eligible for discipline and that such complaints are instead eligible for coaching, training and mediation.\nAs George Floyd is laid to rest, his legacy reverberates across the globe\nHawkins said that if complaints that result in coaching are included, then 18.5% of complaints against Minneapolis police between 2013 and 2019 have ended with some form of corrective action.\nCoaching, however, is not considered a form of discipline, Hawkins said, and state law prohibits the disclosure of which specific cases ended with coaching. From the public's perspective, cases closed with coaching show \"no discipline.\" And the city's current contract with the police union states that investigations into employee conduct that do not result in discipline \"shall not be entered into the employee's official personnel file.\"\nJanee Harteau, who was the city's police chief from 2012 to 2017, said she is not opposed to coaching, but she said omitting complaints closed with coaching from personnel records obstructed her ability to understand whether certain officers had patterns of misconduct.\n\"I can use the analogy of someone who speeds all the time. If you get pulled over and don't have speeding on your record, the officer thinks you don't speed all the time, you know: 'I'll give you a warning, don't do it again.' And then they get pulled over again, and the same thing. But once someone has that on their record, it cues you up that, hey, this isn't your first time that you've been speeding.\"\nShe described the current discipline system as \"ineffective.\"\n\"What we do know is these systems are not set up to be efficient. They change very slowly. Leadership comes and goes and unions stay,\" said Harteau, who described the city's police union as an \"impediment\" to change.\n\"This mess today\"\nPolice Chief Arradondo said Wednesday that his department would integrate new data systems to enable department leaders to intervene after early warning signs of misconduct.\nHe expressed frustration with the union contract, parts of which he said make his job \"difficult.\"\n\"There is nothing more debilitating to a chief\" from an employment perspective than having grounds to terminate an officer for misconduct but not being able to because of \"a third-party mechanism,\" Arradondo said.\nIn a statement, the union, the Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis, called on the chief and the city's mayor to return to contract negotiations. The union has always welcomed the opportunity \"to set clear expectations, train employees as to those expectations, and improve accountability for both officers and supervisors who fail to conduct themselves accordingly,\" it read in part.\nMichelle Gross, the activist, said her organization has repeatedly raised concerns with city officials regarding the handling of complaints and overall accountability, but in her view, mayors, police chiefs and city councils have come and gone without uprooting the underlying causes.\n\"Because we have so failed to address police conduct in this community, it made it literally inevitable that somebody was going to die this way,\" Gross said.\n'Stop the pain': George Floyd's brother calls on lawmakers to overhaul policing laws\nConcerns over the city's handling of police discipline have led to a long history of intervention.\nIn 2003, the police department entered a mediation agreement with the Department of Justice that sought to facilitate reform and address issues including use of force and race relations.\nIn 2007, five black Minneapolis police officers, including the department's current chief, Madaria Arradondo, filed a civil lawsuit that alleged African American officers in the city were disciplined \"more harshly and frequently than...white officers for comparable or more serious misconduct.\" The suit was settled out of court for over $800,000, according to an attorney for the officers.\nIn 2015, a Department of Justice analysis requested by Minneapolis police found that \"serious disciplinary actions against officers occur infrequently.\" The review did state that the police department consistently used proactive interventions like \"coaching\" in response to complaints but recommended the department improve its system for identifying and correcting problematic officers.\nIn 2016, a local police oversight commission detailed \"several issues\" with the complaint-filing process. The committee used \"testers\" to try to file complaints against police officers at several precincts in the city, and found that in 13 of 15 attempts, \"complainants were not offered the opportunity to file a complaint at the precinct,\" according to a draft report posted on the city's website.\nR.T. Rybak, the mayor of Minneapolis from 2002 to 2014, said he tried for years to change the system, but, reflecting on the current state of affairs, admits he did not get the job done.\nMinneapolis City Council members intend to defund and dismantle the city's police department\nHe told CNN he presided over four different police chiefs with four different reform agendas, fought for more transparency in complaints, pushed to keep police officers from living outside the city and sought to diversify the force.\n\"If I had an easy answer about why we haven't gotten more done with police reform in Minneapolis, we wouldn't be in this mess today,\" Rybak said.\nRybak said the department is in need of deep cultural change, and specifically that the contract between the police department and the police union needs an overhaul.\n\"I remember being in many discussions about wanting to take harder discipline and running into all sorts of contract issues,\" said Rybak, who added that the current contract has limited the ability of the city to implement reforms.\nMichael White, a professor in the school of criminology and criminal justice at Arizona State University and a former deputy sheriff, said complaints, whether sustained or not, can be indicative of patterns in an officer's performance.\n\"The vast majority of complaints are not going to be sustained because there isn't corroborating evidence,\" said White, who called the 18 complaints against Chauvin a \"red flag.\"\nWhite noted that some portion of complaints against officers in any city will be frivolous, but that handling of complaints, frivolous or not, is \"critically important\" for establishing public trust.\nRepeated complaints against officers\nDerek Chauvin isn't the only officer criminally charged after the death of Floyd to have previously faced complaints.\nTou Thao, who stood by as Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck, has had six complaints filed with against him. Five were closed with no discipline, according to the city's complaint database.\nOne of those complaints was filed by Lamar Ferguson, who sued Thao and another officer in 2017 for allegedly using \"unreasonable force\" in the form of \"punches, kicks and knees to the face and body\" during Ferguson's arrest in 2014. Ferguson's police complaint against Thao was dismissed with no discipline, but the city paid $25,000 to settle the suit. The city and the officers denied liability in the settlement.\nWhat we know about the four ex-police officers charged in George Floyd's death\nJenna Nelson, an ER nurse and Minneapolis resident, also filed a complaint against Thao.\nShe said in 2017, she called police after an assault. Thao responded to the incident, but when she explained what happened, she said Thao was dismissive and suggested she go to family court.\n\"I just felt like he didn't care and wasn't willing to do anything about why I called,\" Nelson told CNN.\nNelson said she later followed up with the police department and learned that Thao never filed a report about what happened. She submitted a complaint online, but she said eight months passed before she was interviewed by a city investigator about Thao. USA Today first reported her description of the complaint.\nHer complaint against Thao remains open today. A lawyer for Thao declined to comment on the complaints against him.\nPhillip Atiba Goff, co-founder and president of the Center for Policing Equity and a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said effectively responding to complaints against officers can help reduce misconduct, but he argues that focusing on complaints against \"a few bad apples\" misses the broader issue.\n\"The problem in policing is not the few who behaved outside of policy,\" Goff said. \"It's the many who behave inside of policy, which means it's the policy that's the problem.\""}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/30/us/andres-guardado-shooting-los-angeles-deputies/index.html", "headline": "Andres Guardado's family wants independent autopsy, attorney says", "published_date": "2020-06-30", "text": "(CNN)The family of Andres Guardado, the teenager who was shot dead by a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy earlier this month, will be seeking an independent autopsy, attorneys for the family said.\nThe family has complained about a lack of transparency and information from the sheriff's department, which put a \"security hold\" on Guardado's autopsy report from the county medical examiner. The hold means it could be some time before results are released to the public.\nGuardado's death on June 18 sparked outcry across Los Angeles, with his family and others demanding justice. The shooting happened amid weeks of demonstrations following the death of George Floyd, a Black man who died at the hands of Minneapolis police in late May.\nThe deputies pursued Guardado after he \"produced a handgun,\" looked toward the deputies and ran from the front of an auto body shop, said Capt.

Guardado was hit in the upper torso and pronounced dead at the scene, Wegener said.\n\"Guardado refused multiple commands not to reach for a gun, forcing deputy Vega to fire his weapon in fear for his life,\" Marangell told CNN on Friday.\nWegener said Guardado was not wearing a security uniform, nor did he have a gun belt. Guardado was also too young to work as a licensed armed security guard in California, he said.\nDeputies 'are very sorry for the loss of life,' lawyer says\nTom Yu, an attorney representing Hernandez, separately recounted his client's statement to investigators, echoing Wegener's comments that the deputies were driving by the auto shop, where an assault had been reported a week earlier.\n\"They were providing extra patrols in the area to ensure the safety of the citizens there,\" Yu said.\n\"They drove by and they saw a car in front, with Guardado talking to some females there outside the car.\n\"The deputies saw the butt of a firearm sticking out of the waistband of Guardado's pants,\" Yu continued. After the deputies chased him and told him to get on the ground, \"Guardado prones out, he's on the ground but he has access to his firearm. My client can see (only) half of Guardado's body because his view is blocked by a wall.\"\nLA County Board of Supervisors calls for independent investigation into shooting death of teenager\n\"Because Guardado is not listening to commands and reaches for the firearm, Vega is in fear for his life,\" Yu added. \"Vega had nowhere to go, no cover.\"\nYu called the incident \"a justified shooting that happened at the wrong time.\"\n\"They were trying to conduct extra patrols,\" Yu said. \"They are very sorry for the loss of life, sorry for the (Guardado) family. They did not go to work that morning to harm people, they just wanted to go home after their shift to their families.\"\nAttorneys representing the Guardado family disputed the claims by the deputies' lawyers.\n\"There is zero evidence supporting any claim that Andres Guardado was not responding to deputy commands -- his death is the result of an unwarranted and unjustified killing,\" Shea, the family's attorney, told CNN.\nAutopsy report on 'security hold'\nA makeshift shrine formed outside the auto body shop in Gardena on June 21, where mourners left bouquets of flowers, balloons, notes and pictures of Guardado.\nCelina Abarca and Steve Abarca say they want to know why their first cousin was shot and killed by LA County Sheriff's deputies Thursday.

He saw a couple of police cars parked on the lot and thought he'd ask for directions. Williams, a black man, pulled his car in near them and two white officers immediately jumped out and ran to him, both with one hand on a holstered gun and the other holding a flashlight that shined in his face.\nWilliams did what society conditioned him to do in such situations: he put both hands up in the air.\n\"I was acutely aware as a black man that my life was in danger in that moment if I didn't have the right answers,\" said Williams, an organizer with MPD150, a Minneapolis effort created by local organizers that supports the dismantling of the city's police department and the reallocation of police funding to community-based organizations without a history of violence.\n\"What I needed then was not militarized folks who were worried that they're under attack at any given moment,\" Williams added. \"It really drove home for me that even in the most benign of circumstances, police are a threat to me.\"\nActivists, like Williams, who are calling for the defunding and abolition of police, say the future of public safety doesn't need to include police forces that systematically oppress black people, marginalized communities and communities of color.\nInstead, public safety could mean supporting and funding a network of organizations, health care providers, social service agencies, religious and community leaders and others who provide safety, support and prevention. Directing funding in that way would lead to a decline in crimes linked to poverty and systemic disinvestment, activists say.\nOnce thought to be a pipedream that bounced around activist circles, the idea of public safety without the police forces of today has turned into a viable policy platform in the wake of the death of George Floyd and the protests that have followed. Floyd, a black man, pleaded that he couldn't breathe while he was held down with a knee to his neck by a former Minneapolis police officer.\n\"We are seeing the political shift that is happening in real time here,\" David Kennedy, director of National Network for Safe Communities and a criminal justice professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice said.\n'I have...zero examples of police helping me'\nBut there's no one vision for what a future without today's police would look like.\nOn one end of the spectrum, it means pulling money out of policing budgets and redistributing it to community-based intervention programs and services. Instead of sending an officer to a mental health or a domestic abuse call, for instance, a team of crisis workers who are better equipped to de-escalate and provide rehabilitation services would respond. In that example, some sort of policing force would remain, called on for violent situations.\nOn the other end of the spectrum, the goal is to completely abolish police in the US. Policing, some activists say, profits punishment over rehabilitation because of its origin as slave patrols that paid vigilantes to recapture escaped slaves.\n\"My horizon goal is a future where people are not policed,\" said Kristiana Col\u00f3n, an afro-Latina playwright, poet and co-founder of Chicago's #LetUsBreathe collective, which began in 2014 as a way to support protesters on the ground at the Florissant Avenue encampment in Ferguson.\nCol\u00f3n, who works to bring the abolition of police to Chicago, said she is still recovering from being beaten by officers during the initial days of the demonstrations following Floyd's death.\n\"I have absolutely zero examples of the police helping me,\" she told CNN in an interview, recalling an instance when she couldn't get police to file a report about a break in at her home.\n\"I kept reaching out to them as though that's going to happen. And that's simply not how they function,\" she said.\nPeople walk down 16th street after \"Defund The Police\" was painted on the street near the White House.\nCities are reallocating money from police budgets\nIn the wake of Floyd's death, pushed by activists and the protests that have followed, some cities have announced plans to shift money from police departments.\nIn Los Angeles, Mayor Eric Garcetti and Police Commissioner Eileen Decker announced that the city's police budget would not be increased as planned and $100 million to $150 million would be reallocated to \"further enhance community neighborhood policing.\" New York City Mayor Bill DeBlasio said he would reallocate some of the NYPD's $6 billion budget to youth and social services, reversing an April budget proposal that suggested cutting $400 million from the same programs.\nBut no place in the country has gone as far as Minneapolis recently, where nine members of the city council -- a veto-proof majority -- pledged at a community meeting on June 7 to dismantle the police department in its current form.\nDemonstrators marching to defund the Minneapolis Police Department pause outside the Minneapolis Police and Fire Union Office on June 6.\n'Case study for a new era of how to enhance public safety'\nLast week, 12 city council members unanimously approved a resolution to declare the intent to create a \"transformative new model\" of policing in the city, setting off a year-long process to envision and create a new way to keep people safe.\nFive members also announced their intent to introduce a charter amendment for the November ballot of this year, which would propose the elimination of the Minneapolis Police Department to create \"a new Charter Department to provide for community safety and violence.\" A tedious process, according to local reporters, if it makes it to the ballot and is approved by voters, it would remove MPD from the city's charter and the city could begin to dismantle it. Activists say this would circumvent Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, who has said he's not in favor of dismantling.\nThe council's moves come after years of organizing from community activist groups including Black Visions Collective, Reclaim the Block, Black Lives Matter Minneapolis and MPD150.\nAfter a series of high-profile killings by the police in Minneapolis and demonstrations to demand action, Black Visions Collective along with Reclaim the Block began a campaign in 2018 that organized hundreds of community members to go to city budget hearings and explain to their council members what makes them feel safe. More often than not, the answer was not police presence.\nThose efforts bore fruit after video of Floyd's death went viral and protests began.\nMinneapolis Councilmember Steve Fletcher said police weren't responding to 911 calls during the initial days of the protests, so community leaders and activists started emergency troubleshooting. Some of his colleagues, Fletcher said, broke curfew to organize neighborhood watches while he and others took calls and emails from citizens to resolve issues in the middle of the night.\n\"We were deeply engaged in the kind of community problem solving and crisis work that both brought people together and showed people how much community capacity for problem solving we have. And also, prompted a lot of in a very tough conversation among us informally,\" Fletcher said.\nExactly what dismantling the police department in its current will look like in Minneapolis is unknown. Some say they don't want it to look like Camden, New Jersey, which broke its police unions, hired more officers for less money and implemented reforms, but residents still experience aggressive surveillance and policing, according to criminology professor Brendan McQuade.\nStill, Fletcher says he's heard from his constituents that they'd like to have some sort of tactical force with the capacity to respond to dangerous situations. The rest will be decided with massive input from the community and organizers, along with the city council.\nTwo police officers stand outside the Third Police Precinct during the \"I Can't Breathe\" protest on May 27 in Minneapolis.\nResponding with prevention in mind\nIn a police-free future, activists described a world where communities decide what behavior is allowed and highlight the importance of neighbors -- not as watchdogs but as those who can respond with prevention in mind.\n\"There will be a focus on in-the-moment de-escalating a situation, and also making sure that everyone involved has the resources that they need,\" said Molly Glasgow, a member of MPD150.\nThe restorative process will focus on understanding why the issue happened in the first place, Glasgow said.\nIn the case of a robbery or violent crime, Williams highlighted the use of community patrols that arose during the demonstrations in effort to guard against crime for the short term, until more money is invested into social services.\n\"Our neighborhood defense networks were an important part of recognizing that it was a threat and defending folks against it,\" Williams said.\nAnother idea is to use an operator for emergency services that would direct 911 calls to a tactical force, fire department or a mental health crisis line depending on the situation instead of all calls going directly to the police. A version of it is already being used in Austin, Texas.\nAnother option is to deploy crisis teams, similar to the \"CAHOOTS\" program in Eugene, Oregon, that dispatch a medic, and crisis worker trained in the mental health field to each case.\nIn a police-free future, domestic violence cases could be handled not by relying on a carceral system, but by focusing on understanding where violence stems from, be it a mental health problem, a substance abuse problem, an unemployment problem or unaddressed trauma problem, Vitale said. Safety for the victim would be prioritized, as police typically respond to domestic violence calls after they've already been committed.\n\"What we want is a place in the community that people can go to and say, 'I got a problem. I need some help, but I don't want anyone sent to jail. I want to keep this family together if I can.' And if that doesn't work, then 'I need help getting out of this arrangement,'\" Vitale said, adding that communities can create violence centers or women centers with trained professionals to identify resources already present in their lives.\nOrganizers acknowledge the framework has to come together at a quick pace, even as potential challenges loom, including pushback from the police union.\nNon-profits may be guides for cities\nThere are guides for how Minneapolis might create its new reality -- though they exist on a smaller scale as non-profits or community-based programs funded by local governments.\nThe Health Alliance for Violence Intervention is one non-profit example. Used in hospitals in 70 cities across the nation, violence intervention specialists from the same community arrive after a victim has been admitted to the hospital. They sit bedside to run a retaliation screening asking what happened and if the victim is still in danger, while providing supportive resources. And if the victim identifies the perpetrator or a network of community members does, the specialist then goes to the assailant to identify if risks still remain -- hoping to bring both the victim and perpetrator into the organization, halting the cycle of violence and promoting restoration through mediation.\n\"We're able to lower violence and their likelihood of coming back into the hospital with another gunshot wound, we're really focusing on their health and healing,\" said Fatimah Loren Muhammad, HAVI executive director.\nThe process works in large part because they're not asking police-like investigation questions, but asking what the victim needs in effort to create a solution, as victims are less likely to talk to the police after injury, according to DLIVE executive director Ray Winans, a partner of the HAVI in Detroit.\n\"Our approach is never to go after the perpetrator in a sense of an investigation but it's to get the perpetrator and the victim and or the network of folks to sit down and have communication.\"\nAsked what challenges Minneapolis can expect during their transformational process, Muhammad said it's understanding the scale of investment that it will take. And without that, the initiative could fail.\n\"This is not a Band-Aid issue, right? We're talking about structural racism, we're talking about systems that have perpetrated harm or in whole communities for a long time. So, you've got to be very strategic and you've got to invest deeply,\" she said.\nCommunity knows 'best way to keep each other safe'\nEven organizers in favor of abolishing police departments still worry about what the future will look and what mechanisms will be put in place to handle crimes like sexual assault and violence, when the current system goes away.\n\"What are we going to put in place in order to make sure both things don't happen? And that's a larger reimagining of what liberation and freedom looks like for everybody moving forward,\" Fadumo Ali, an organizer and teacher based in Minneapolis said.\nBut organizers and council members, who during the June 7 community meeting asked attendees to write down what makes them feel safe along with their questions and concerns as the first of many conversations, anticipate setbacks.\n\"We actually want to be honest about the fact that it sounds scary because we're like, how are we going to keep ourselves safe? Our assertion is that our community knows the very best way to keep each other safe.\" Noor added.\nReplicating across the nation\nAs Minneapolis pioneers a plan to dismantle its police force, legislators at the federal level are not on the same page. Republicans have been looking to tie Democrats to the issue, while Democrats have voiced support for investing more in communities but not dismantling police forces.\n\"I think that a big part of this conversation really is about reimagining how we do public safety in America, which I support,\" Sen. Kamala Harris said on ABC's \"The View\" earlier this month.\n\"We have confused the idea that to achieve safety, you put more cops on the street instead of understanding to achieve safe and healthy communities you put more resources into the public education system of those communities, into affordable housing,\" among other initiatives.\nMinnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar said she was not in favor of \"abolishing public safety departments and police departments,\" but said conditions can be put on their funding.\nFederal legislators point to reforms like a major bill introduced in the House and Senate Democrats called the Justice in Police Act that would create a national ban on chokeholds as an acceptable use of force, create a National Police Misconduct Registry, provide incentives for local governments to conduct racial bias training for officers, and set caps on the transfer of military-grade equipment to law enforcement, among other initiatives.\nBut advocates of dismantling police forces say cities with some of the worst policing records have passed many of the reforms and not much has changed, as it falls on individual police chiefs to implement them and just lessens the amount of damage done by police officers instead of eradicating it.\n\"When we talk about reform, often what that looks like is more funding for the police justified by, 'oh, we're going to do more training, or we're going to do different kinds of training,'\" said Col\u00f3n. \"Reforms are to police what thoughts and prayers are to mass shootings.\"\nWilliams is one of the people pushing for not just reform, but what he says is transformative change through the abolition of police forces.\nOfficers eventually accepted that he wanted to ask them for directions, he said.\nBut they warned him that should he need directions again, he should park far away and approach officers with his hands up, so as not to look like a threat, Williams said.\n\"Police abolition is ultimately about getting our communities the things that they need to be successful.\"\nCNN's Sarah Moon, Manu Raju, Clare Foran and Aaron Cooper contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/30/us/elijah-mcclain-profile/index.html", "headline": "Elijah McClain was a massage therapist who 'wanted to heal' others, his mother says", "published_date": "2020-06-30", "text": "(CNN)Before his name was added to a growing list of Black people killed at the hands of police, Elijah McClain \"was a happy young man\" who was \"always energetic,\" his mother says.\nMcClain, 23, was a massage therapist, according to Sheneen McClain.

It was there that Elijah McClain died last August after a confrontation with Aurora police officers.\nA 911 caller had described a \"suspicious person,\" according to a police overview of the incident. The confrontation led to one officer placing McClain in a carotid hold, or chokehold. McClain suffered a heart attack while in the ambulance and was declared brain dead three days later.\nAfter almost a year of family members and community activists calling for justice, Gov. Jared Polis announced last week his administration would reexamine the case. The officers involved have also been reassigned to \"nonenforcement\" duties, or administrative tasks such as paperwork.\n\"It should not have escalated from a suspicious call to my son dying,\" Lawayne Mosley, McClain's father, told CNN affiliate KMGH-TV. \"I should be getting grandbabies from him.\"\nMother says she doesn't know who to trust anymore\nMcClain was walking home after purchasing an iced tea from a convenience store August 24, 2019, KMGH reported.\nHe was wearing a ski mask at the time, his family told the affiliate, because he was \"anemic and got cold easily.\"\nAfter receiving the \"suspicious person\" call, three White officers stopped McClain.\nMcClain resisted officer contact, the police report says, and a struggle ensued. On one of the officers' body cameras, McClain is heard saying, \"I'm an introvert, please respect the boundaries that I am speaking.\"\nElijah McClain's family is getting the investigation into his death they have been seeking for almost a year\nBody camera video shows McClain telling officers that he was trying to stop his music to listen to them, then they begin to arrest him.

They released the hold, the report says, and he began struggling again. When paramedics arrived at the scene they administered ketamine to sedate McClain, the report said. He was taken to a hospital, where he died.\nAn autopsy did not determine a cause of death but listed intense physical exertion and a narrow left coronary artery as contributing factors, according to the police overview. The coroner found the amount of ketamine in his system to be a therapeutic amount.\nAfter weeks of protests, meaningful police reform appears unlikely\nThere was no official determination as to how McClain died, and Adams County District Attorney Dave Young told CNN last week that was a major factor in not prosecuting the case.\n\"In my business, I can't take a case to court that we don't know the answers to those questions,\" Young told CNN's Chris Cuomo on Thursday. \"I cannot take a case to the jury where I don't know what the cause of death is on a homicide case.\"\nAttorney General Phil Weiser will now investigate McClain's death at the governor's order.

His case gained renewed attention with the recent deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Rayshard Brooks at the hands of police.\nMore than 2 million people signed a petition urging officials to conduct a new investigation into McClain's death, which led to the governor's call to reexamine the case.\n\"Last year, we stood on the municipal center steps demanding an investigation and what did we hear then? Crickets,\" Newman, the McClain family attorney, told CNN's Don Lemon on Thursday. \"Why did it take almost a year, international media attention, millions of people signing a petition for a responsible adult to finally step up and do what should have happened right from the outset?\"\nElijah McClain's family lawyer responds to DA's claim 03:13\nNewman said it is ridiculous that the autopsy report did not have a cause of death.\n\"The autopsy was attended by two members of the Aurora police department, two members of the district attorney's office, and it bends over backwards to say everything except for the truth,\" Newman told Lemon.\nAnd Newman attributed lack of evidence to the officers dislodging their body cameras, which she believed to be intentional. All three came off when the officers tackled McClain, and at three different times in the video, people were told to remove or turn off the cameras, she said.\nProtests have raged in the aftermath of McClain's death. Most recently, demonstrators caused a shutdown of Interstate 225 on Saturday.\nInterim Aurora Police Chief Vanessa Wilson said the community was reeling from McClain's death, who she said \"was not only a beloved son, brother and friend, but also a valued member of our community.\"\n\"I have heard from our community, and I am listening today,\" Wilson wrote. \"Their voices and concerns are not falling on deaf ears.

The NMCG has always said we are the militia we are not police and do not enforce laws and we call the police officers when a crime is committed.\"\nThe militia insisted politics were behind the lawsuit, adding, \"If they pass this through the courts they can go after any gun club, any group that they disagree with who slides (sic) any training or has any dissenting political opinion. PEOPLE WAKE UP!!!!!\"\nIn the Facebook response to the government's lawsuit, the New Mexico Civil Guard did not address the allegation that some of the group's members have connections to those associated with white supremacy. CNN reached out Tuesday to the group for comment.\nIn the civil lawsuit, the district attorney claims the militia's actions at demonstrations may cause local citizens to incorrectly infer the armed group has police powers and creates additional problems for law enforcement officers trying to keep the peace.\n\"By appearing armed and uniformed at such events, NMCG creates a risk that its members will be mistaken for authorized police or military personnel, confusing members of the public and complicating the efforts of law enforcement to respond to any unrest that arises at those events,\" according to the lawsuit.\n\"Law enforcement must also take into account the risk of triggering violence on NMCG's part when determining whether and how to intervene in any disturbances that occur at public gatherings attended by the group.\"\nThe New Mexico Civil Guard made national headlines at one of several protests that erupted across the nation following the death of George Floyd at the hands of police in Minneapolis.\nAlbuquerque police detain members of the New Mexico Civil Guard last month in Albuquerque.\nOn June 15, demonstrators supporting racial justice gathered in Albuquerque near a statue of controversial conquistador Juan de O\u00f1ate, demanding its removal.

Baca was charged Monday with aggravated battery with a deadly weapon.\nBaca's attorney, Jason Bowles, has said his client was acting in self-defense. He said Baca was trying to disengage as one person attacked him with a skateboard and another man came at him with two knives.\nAccording to a criminal complaint from Albuquerque police, cell phone footage recorded by a bystander shows a man in a blue shirt, later identified as Baca, appearing to protect the statue. The complaint says Baca eventually left the area of the statue but was pursued by some people from the crowd.\nAlthough the militia group denies Baca was a member, the incident sparked widespread outrage and condemnation from local leaders, who accused the militia of inciting violence.\n\"There is absolutely no space in New Mexico for any violent would-be 'militia' seeking to terrorize New Mexicans,\" Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said immediately following the incident. \"The instigators this evening will be rooted out, they will be investigated, and they will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.\"\nThe lawsuit filed on Monday is a unique endeavor by the district attorney, who has joined with Georgetown University's Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection to sue in order to stop the New Mexico Civil Guard from engaging in law enforcement activities prosecutors say can only be authorized by the governor.\n\"Private militia activity at public rallies poses a threat both to public safety and to free expression -- and it violates laws in every state in the country,\" said Joshua Geltzer, the institute's executive director, in an interview with CNN.\n\"This case shows a district attorney using the laws available to him to protect his community and safeguard free speech, and doing so creatively through a civil suit based on his authority under state law -- and we're proud to team up with him in the effort,\" Geltzer said.\nIn its Facebook post responding to the lawsuit, the militia group warned the new civil action will have legal consequences beyond their organization.\n\"This is not just about the Civil Guard this is going to be turned into case law that will be used to beat down anyone who disagrees with a parties views and every constitutional citizens militia,\" the group wrote.\nIn addition to the state's civil lawsuit, US Sen.

The President says federal resources were sent to protect the downtown federal building -- which has periodically been targeted by rioters setting fire and launching fireworks at the building -- but some protesters say it is the large increase in federal forces that continues to fuel their anger.\nWhile protests during the daylight hours have been overwhelmingly peaceful -- marked by marches, unity gatherings, and even the singing of songs -- clashes at night between some protesters and federal officers have resulted in the repeated vandalism of the US courthouse in downtown Portland and the tear gassing of demonstrators.\nIn one incident earlier this month at the courthouse, police say a person was arrested after assaulting a federal agent with a hammer.\nThe video showing the medics shoved by officers is not the only recent encounter to generate widespread controversy and allegations of excessive use of force by law enforcement.\nOn Saturday night, 53-year-old Navy veteran Chris Davis told CNN he was beaten by a federal agent with a baton outside the court house and sprayed with pepper spray at close range.

They are more likely to be exposed to contaminated water, and to live near hazardous waste sites. And as the climate crisis worsens, many groups \u2014 including poor communities and communities of color \u2014 are the most vulnerable to the dangers of a warming planet.\nIn short, experts say Black people in the US are dying as a result of environmental racism.\nThough environmental injustice isn't new, advocates say it hasn't always captured the same public outrage as other forms of systemic racism.\nThis is how communities of color in the US are feeling the effects of environmental injustice.\nAir pollution\nA layer of pollution can be seen hovering over Los Angeles, California, in 2017.\nThe microscopic dust spewed into the air from power plants, tail pipes and wildfires is an invisible killer.\nIn the US, more than 30,000 deaths in a single year may have been caused by air pollution, according to a 2019 study \u2014 and air quality has gotten worse in recent years, despite recent improvements during the Covid-19 pandemic.\nCommunities of color are most impacted by this airborne pollution.\nThough Black and Hispanic Americans generate less air pollution, they are more likely to be exposed to its harmful effects, according to a 2019 study.\n\"Other issues are more visceral \u2014 they're right in your face,\" said Dr. Mustafa Santiago Ali, a vice president at the National Wildlife Federation who spent 24 years at the EPA. \"(With air pollution) it's slower, but it's still death.\"\nStudies have connected air pollution to a host of heart and lung diseases, and more recently, Covid-19, which has disproportionately impacted Black Americans.\nA study released in April by Harvard researchers found that people infected with Covid-19 are more likely to die if they live in areas with higher air pollution.\nBut there are other pollutants lurking in the air that scientists and activists point to as evidence of environmental racism.\nOne of the most notorious examples in the US is the region dubbed \"Cancer Alley,\" an 85-mile corridor in Louisiana between Baton Rouge and New Orleans dotted with chemical plants.\nLaPlace, a small Cancer Alley town that sits in the shadow of a synthetic rubber factory, at one point had the highest risk of cancer from air toxins in the nation, according to the EPA.

LaPlace is in St. John the Baptist Parish, which earlier this year had the highest per capita death rate from Covid-19 of anywhere in the US.\nWater quality\nTap water from Flint, Michigan, appears discolored in 2019. Thousands in the city were exposed to high levels of lead in their water after a decision to change the city's water source in 2014.\nFor many, Flint, Michigan, has become synonymous with the problem of mass water contamination in the US.\nAfter local and state officials decided to switch Flint's water supply to cut costs, thousands of residents of the predominantly Black city \u2014 including children \u2014 were exposed to dangerous levels of lead.\nLead exposure has been linked to cardiovascular, kidney and reproductive problems. It poses health issues for pregnant women and has been linked to developmental delays in fetuses and children, according to the EPA.\nBut experts say issues of water quality and race aren't confined to Flint.\n\"Throughout our history, African Americans have been subjected to living in places that have not been as conducive to good air and clean water,\" said Toney, who began her focus on environmental issues as the first Black mayor of Greenville, Mississippi.\nCommunities of color across the US are more likely to have drinking water that doesn't meet federal standards, according to an analysis published in March by the non-profit Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC).\nThe NRDC's analysis also found there's less enforcement of water standards among non-White and non-native English-speaking populations.\nClimate change\nA man pushes a bike through floodwaters dumped by Hurricane Harvey in Orange, Texas, in 2017. A survey conducted after the hurricane found Black and low-income residents in Houston faced the most difficulty rebounding from the devastation.\nWhile the consequences of our rapidly warming planet are being felt everywhere on Earth, communities of color are often ill equipped to protect themselves from the climate crisis.\nThe 2018 National Climate Assessment, the US government's most comprehensive report on the impact of current and future climate change, says, \"Across all climate risks, children, older adults, low-income communities, some communities of color, and those experiencing discrimination are disproportionately affected by extreme weather and climate events, partially because they are often excluded in planning processes.\"\nThe problem is twofold, says Marie Lynn Miranda, an incoming professor of applied and computational mathematics and statistics at the University of Notre Dame, who has written extensively about environmental justice.\n\"Low-resource people are more likely to be in the impact zone,\" Miranda said. \"And they're more likely to live in places that don't have the resources to bring good mitigation technologies to bear.\"\nThis disparity was evident in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, a category 4 storm that struck Houston in 2017.\nA survey conducted nearly a year after Harvey found that Black and lower-income residents were more likely to say they were not getting the help they needed to rebuild their lives.\nHazardous waste\nWhen it comes to how and where waste is stored and disposed of, race plays a role as well.\nLow-income and non-White communities are more likely to have hazardous waste sites and other polluting facilities in their neighborhoods, according to 2016 paper published by two University of Michigan researchers, who compared 30 years of demographic data with the location of these sites in the US.\nThe researchers said this is because these communities often don't have the resources or political power to keep potentially dangerous facilities out of their neighborhoods.\nRace matters when it comes to where polluting facilities are built, says Dr. Robert Bullard, a professor at Texas Southern University who is often referred to as the father of environmental justice.\n\"Race is the most potent predictor of which communities are more polluted and which ones are not,\" said Bullard, a professor of urban planning and environmental policy at Texas Southern University. \"Not income, not wealth, not home ownership.\""}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/25/us/wilmington-north-carolina-police-officers-fired-trnd/index.html", "headline": "Three police officers fired after they are caught using 'hate-filled speech,' chief says", "published_date": "2020-06-25", "text": "(CNN)Three Wilmington, North Carolina, police officers have been fired after they were heard on video spewing \"hate-filled speech\" and referring \"to Black people as the n-word,\" Police Chief Donny Williams said Wednesday.\nThe officers were identified as Officer James Gilmore, Corporal Jesse Moore II and Officer Kevin Piner. According to a report that details the findings of an internal investigation, Piner and Moore also criticized Williams, who is Black.

He said he would notify the North Carolina Criminal Justice Training and Standards Commission to determine whether the officers can maintain certification to practice law enforcement in the state.\nThe department also will consult with the district attorney's office about this case to determine if crimes were committed by the officers, Williams said in the internal investigation documents, and would review the cases the officers had charged to see if there was any bias toward the offenders.\nAdditionally, the police department is asking the courts to decide whether some or all of the video should be released.\nCNN has reached out to the union representing the police department for comment. Attempts to reach each officer were unsuccessful.\n'Put 'em back about four or five generations'\nThe video was discovered on June 4 during a monthly video review, according to the internal investigation report. The footage, captured by Piner's in-vehicle dashboard camera, was classified as an \"accidental activation,\" the report says.\nAbout 46 minutes into the nearly 2-hour-long video, Piner is heard speaking with Gilmore, who has pulled his vehicle up beside Piner's.\nThe two officers discuss recent Black Lives Matter protests, and Piner says that the department's only concern is \"kneeling down with the Black folks.\" Gilmore also describes a video he saw about White people \"bowing down on their knees and 'worshipping Blacks,'\" the report says.\n\"How many times have I told you it's almost like they think they're their own god?\" Gilmore said, according to the report.\nThree men indicted in the death of Ahmaud Arbery\nThe two officers criticized the police department's response to Wilmington protests and made derogatory comments about some of their fellow officers.\nLater, Piner is heard answering a phone call from Moore, who told Piner about a woman he arrested the day before, referring to her with the n-word, the report says.\nAt one point, Moore said that \"she needed a bullet in her head right then and move on. Let's move the body out of the way and keep going.\"\nPiner later said that he believed a civil war was coming, adding he was going to buy a new assault rifle. He felt martial law would be declared and said, \"we are just gonna go out and start slaughtering them f***ing (n-words). I can't wait,\" according to the report.\nMoore said he wouldn't do that, but Piner said he felt a civil war was necessary to \"wipe 'em off the f***ing map.\"\n\"That'll put 'em back about four or five generations,\" Piner said. Moore responded \"you're crazy,\" the report says.\nAccording to the internal investigation report, Moore and Piner also attacked the department's response to Wilmington protests. At one point, Moore said the police chief \"dropped the f***ing ball\" and that there were \"too many times that all he cares about is the f***ing community.\"\nBehavior 'will not be tolerated'\nEach officer was interviewed separately about the comments on June 9, as part of the professional standards investigation. The officers denied they were racists, but did not deny making the statements heard in the video, according to the report.\nMoore said he was off duty and on his personal phone at the time of his conversation with Piner. He said he was just \"venting\" about the arrest he had made and that the recent protests had caused him a lot of stress, according to the report. He told investigators he was embarrassed about the comments and said he doesn't typically speak like that.\nA generation hit by three soul-crushing crises\nPiner also said his comments were not characteristic of who he was and that he found them embarrassing, the report says. Recent protests had caused him a great deal of stress, he said, and made him fear for himself and his family. He pointed investigators to a video he saw on social media that he said showed a Black man calling on people to find officers' homes and kill their families. Piner also said he had reached out to the Employee Assistance Program because he felt he was at a breaking point, the report says.\nGilmore said during the interview that he was speaking about videos he had seen on social media, and that he \"always treats everyone fairly regardless of their race,\" the documents show.\nThe internal investigation found that the officers violated the department's standard of conduct, according to the report, and they were terminated.\nMoore and Piner were also found to have violated the policies prohibiting criticizing the police department and using inappropriate slurs.\n\"There are certain behaviors that one must have in order to be a police officer and these three officers have demonstrated that they do not possess it,\" Chief Williams said in a statement. \"When I first learned of these conversations, I was shocked, saddened and disgusted.

Created by Leah Asmelash and Brandon Tensley, this newsletter hopes to offer a window into how history can, and should, inform people's lives.\nBut this isn't a dry history textbook. Our aim is to help readers engage in the challenging conversations on race by introducing them to more contemporary pieces of culture that will entertain and illuminate as much as they educate and inform.\nFor this week, we highlight Hulu removing a supposed blackface episode, revisit Martin Luther King Jr.'s final essay and take a look at the BET Awards, which were exactly what we needed.\nThis week in culture\nLeah: Did you hear about Hulu pulling that episode of \"The Golden Girls,\" with \"blackface\"? Any thoughts?\nBrandon: Yes! I did hear about that -- and I think that it's BANANAS.\nL: OK, explain! So many TV shows have been doing this. What makes GG different?\nB: For one, in that particular GG episode, the characters -- Rose and Blanche -- aren't actually in blackface. They're wearing mud masks and freak out because they think that somebody might mistake the masks for blackface. The episode is about white anxiety when it comes to race.\nHulu's decision seems like a reflexive one instead of a rigorous one that might prod audiences to think more deeply about race, or about the enduring impact and influence of cultural artifacts.\nL: Right! It just feels like Hulu missed the point? They're pulling the episode because they think that it'll get backlash, without doing any real grappling with the issue. Kind of like ... the NBA saying that it will paint Black Lives Matter on its courts?\nB: Lordt. Yeah, I sort of rolled my eyes when I read that announcement. It's not that visible signs of solidarity aren't important. It's that, too often, that's where support for a marginalized community ends -- with a cute gesture. I'm curious to see if the NBA, which historically has been a very activist-minded organization, supports the Black Lives Matter movement in other, more substantial ways. But what are your thoughts?\nL: I agree. So much of this moment feels super performative to me. Some NBA players have asked not to resume the season in light of the protests, and yet the commissioner is forging ahead -- ignoring these complaints (presumably because of money). There's also a lot of dark irony in the fact that the majority-Black NBA will be exposing its players to the coronavirus on courts that literally say that their lives matter. It's like the NBA is activist-y when it suits it. Kind of like how that Houston realtor group said that it'd stop using the phrase \"master\" in reference to bedrooms and bathrooms, when that's not really the main problem people are worried about.\nB: Are there any other recent examples that jump out at you as cringey?\nL: WHERE TO BEGIN. I'm a sports fan, so I keep going back to the Washington NFL team, which is quite literally named after a Native slur. On Black Out Tuesday, they released their little statement saying that Black Lives Matter, but if they truly believed that Black lives matter, they should believe that Native lives matter, too. Which makes me think: How can you say BLM when your name is a slur? One doesn't match the other.\nB: My pessimistic takeaway from all this is that these sorts of moves are more about protecting brands than about supporting lives. Show is nice. Substance is better. As so many people have been saying, this moment feels different. Hopefully the responses from organizations will be different, too.\n'A Testament of Hope'\nIf you think that the ongoing protests are just about police killing Black men and women, you're missing the point. They're about so much more: about ending mass incarceration, about investing in housing programs. You can't separate one from the other.\nA good place to start to understand how everything is interconnected is with this essay from Martin Luther King Jr., \"A Testament of Hope,\" which made the same point in 1968. Because, alas, we've been fighting the same fight for more than half a century.\n\"The black revolution is much more than a struggle for the rights of Negroes,\" King wrote. \"It is forcing America to face all its interrelated flaws -- racism, poverty, militarism and materialism. It is exposing evils that are rooted deeply in the whole structure of our society.\"\nIn addition to revealing the radical dimensions of a civil rights icon who's often flattened to his non-violence mantra, the essay helps us to understand why the current Black Lives Matter protests, fueled by years of organizing, feel so impactful.\nFollowing the police killing of George Floyd in May, demonstrators haven't just been condemning the latest manifestation of American racism; they've been aiming at, to use King's own words, the very roots of social control. They're aware that advocating for Black Americans can't be teased apart from, say, ending police militarization, or from investing in economic justice broadly. King reminds us that it's here, in this expansive vision of liberation, where hope lies -- where the most momentous change starts.\nRecommended for your eyes and ears\nFor the last week, we've had Beyonc\u00e9's \"Black Parade\" on repeat. It's not just because it's a defiant celebration of Blackness (that's expected from Beyonc\u00e9). It's also because every listen is a revelation. Each reference -- to a Baobab tree, to an ankh charm -- sends you on a journey to learn more (if you don't already know) or to appreciate (if you do).\nIf you're interested in the rigorous study of race, you're hopefully already familiar with the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones.

Until you're the one handing the judge the paper with your name on it, saying, 'This guy is done,'\" he paused, searching for the words, \"it's something different.\"\nSo, what would he say if his request to sit down with Roof were granted?\n\"It's not in my physical being to forgive him, but I want to let him know why it was done,\" Truesdale said.\nWhy it was done\nThere was minimal hesitation among the jurors deciding the young murderer's fate, Truesdale said. Roof was proud of his racism. He flaunted it. Given a chance to plead for forgiveness, he instead said, \"I felt like I had to do it, and I still do feel like I had to do it.\"\nThen there was Susie Jackson. What would possess a man, Truesdale asked, to fire 11 bullets into an 87-year-old woman?\n\"There is no remorse,\" he said. \"It was a very simple process.\"\nDylann Roof: 'I do not regret what I did' 03:39\nTruesdale also wants answers -- something he could take back to victims' relatives who didn't get a chance to communicate to Roof the depth of their loss -- though he doubts the killer would provide any.\n\"He's going to roll his eyes like he did the entire (trial),\" he said.\nWhile Truesdale doesn't take ordering Roof's execution lightly, it doesn't haunt him, either. He has often wondered if it would one day.\n\"I'm always sitting there wondering: At some point, are you going to look at this like something different should have been done?\" he said, but he always concludes, \"It was done exactly how it should've been done.\"\n'I made 17 siblings'\nAside from work and family, Truesdale has spent time in the last five years speaking at events and working with nonprofits that promote racial understanding and advocate for domestic violence survivors. He chats regularly with victims' relatives, Mother Emanuel pastor the Rev. Eric Manning, and Jennifer Berry Hawes, who wrote a book on the massacre's aftermath.\nHe's met heroes and survivors from other mass shootings, including police officers who responded last year in Christchurch, New Zealand, and Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, who survived the 2018 attack on Pittsburgh's Tree of Life synagogue.\nYet among his most cherished takeaway from the days he spent in the jury box are the bonds he forged with fellow jurors. He speaks with one of them at least weekly. They're united by more than friendship. They send cards when babies are born and when parents are ill.\nPastor: Charleston shooter 'pure evil' 01:14\n\"I made 17 siblings. It's beyond friends,\" Truesdale, an only child, said.\nThe 18 jurors -- 12 who sat on the panel and six alternates -- all live within 100 miles of Charleston and meet at least once a year, but they aim for two or three get-togethers annually. It might be for breakfast or a field trip. The meetups usually begin with fist pumps, and hugs and kisses.\n\"We don't talk about the trial. That was our only rule,\" Truesdale said.\nA month after US Judge Richard Gergel sentenced Roof to death, the group visited Mother Emanuel -- not as tourists but as parishioners.\nAs The Post and Courier in Charleston reported of the visit, \"They wanted to see the church as a house of worship, not a tomb.\"\n'It was bad enough then'\nThe jurors sometimes struggle to process the riots and protests surrounding the deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and other African Americans. It's been a \"tough couple months,\" Truesdale said, and they're checking on each other regularly to see how they're all coping.\nIf someone feels passionately about something, that person leads the conversation. There are no diatribes.\nVictims of church massacre laid to rest in Charleston 02:09\n\"It's just nice to be able to listen sometimes,\" Truesdale said.\nThe country is seeing too many black people killed over nothing, he said, and he and the other jurors find themselves \"damned disgusted with the process.\"\nIn their conversations, they've complained variously about the innocent people being hurt and killed, the agitators \"poking people with sticks and leaving the scene,\" the small businesses suffering so much of the riots' destruction and how poorly governments are handling the outrage.\n\"We've gone through this way too much here lately,\" he said. \"It was bad enough then, but now with all this, it sort of hits you in a different place.\"\nTruesdale wants an end to the violence, but there are \"too many crazies,\" he said, and he's afraid it will only continue.\nIt's not enough, he finds, for people to say they support Black Lives Matter. There's so much virtue signaling today, he wants to know why they feel black lives matter -- and he asks them.\nHonoring the lives lost in the Charleston shooting 01:28\n\"I need to understand why they think that,\" he said. \"Anybody can put a bumper sticker on a car or wear a hat or T-shirt.\"\nThe answer he wants to hear?\n\"Because they're abused. They as a people, they as a race, they've been abused. If you can't answer why, then you're really not committed to the process, in my opinion.\""}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/02/us/david-mcatee-louisville-what-we-know-trnd/index.html", "headline": "Louisville BBQ man who was fatally shot when police dispersed crowd used to feed officers for free", "published_date": "2020-06-02", "text": "(CNN)David \"Yaya\" McAtee and his BBQ joint were fixtures on the Louisville corner where he was fatally shot as police and the Kentucky National Guard dispersed a large crowd early Monday.\nMcAtee, 53, called the spot \"one of the busiest locations in West Louisville,\" where he had built a steady clientele over the years that included local cops his mother said usually ate for free.

Did you hear about the DeSean Jackson and Nick Cannon controversy? Because -- yikes.\nBrandon: Oof, yes. Give me your take.\nL: So, Jackson, the Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver, posted a fake Adolf Hitler quote on Instagram and Cannon spewed anti-Semitic conspiracy theories on his podcast. They were being ignorant and anti-Semitic, and perpetuating tensions between Jewish and Black people, when there shouldn't be any. There's a rich history of cooperation between these two groups, and there are people who live at the intersection of these identities; Black Jewish people do exist. Comments like those from Jackson and Cannon invalidate them and their experiences.\nNick Cannon\nAnyway, both men eventually apologized, but it wasn't pretty.\nB: What strikes me about these two incidents is that they highlight something that's unsurprising but still worth pointing out: that prejudices also exist within Black communities. Dwayne Wade and Diddy also were the targets of criticism for defending Cannon. (Though Wade later clarified).\nIn other words, our own experiences with racism don't prevent us from propping up other kinds of bigotry, whether we see it or not.\nL: Yeah, for sure. I think that this whole thing reveals how even marginalized groups can support other types of oppression.\nI also think that you could connect this conversation to colorism -- the skin tone-based hierarchy within many communities that favors lighter skin. Just last year, Lupita Nyong'o -- who wrote a children's book, \"Sulwe,\" about a girl who wants her dark skin to be lighter -- called colorism \"the daughter of racism.\"\nB: Without conflating the particulars of different prejudices, I've stopped a few times this past week to think about how broadly entrenched bigotry is in American society.\nPart of its power is that it doesn't always need to register as egregious to be harmful. For many, antisemitic remarks may not have the same sting as other, state-sanctioned manifestations of prejudice, like the police killing of George Floyd in May.\nL: YES, you're totally right. If an anti-Semitic comment isn't along the lines of Holocaust denial, people often look past it, I think, or excuse it as \"not that bad.\"\nThe historical context\nThe Mississippi Burning case\nBetween DeSean Jackson's post of a fake Adolf Hitler quote on Instagram and Nick Cannon's antisemitic remarks on his podcast, the past week has been filled with examples of how prejudices can replicate and congeal even among marginalized groups.\nThe resulting conversations have been fruitful: They've made crystal clear the importance of detecting and grappling with cultural blind spots, specifically within Black communities.\nBut less talked about is the fact that addressing anti-Semitism is crucial not just because it's the right thing to do, but also because it's vital for understanding the wider workings of oppression. anti-Semitism -- anti-Jewish hostility -- is an ideological pillar of White supremacy, the very same bigotry that's long threatened Black Americans.\nThe past reminds us that there's a long history of Black and Jewish partnerships on civil rights issues, and that Black and Jewish lives have both been kindling for White supremacy.\nMichael Schwerner, James Chaney and Andrew Goodman\nIn June 1964, three young men -- James Chaney from Meridian, Mississippi, and Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner from New York City -- were killed in Mississippi while trying to register Black Americans to vote as part of the Freedom Summer campaign. A group of policemen and Klansmen shot the three civil rights workers to death before burying their bodies in an earthen dam. (This triple murder is the subject of the 1988 film \"Mississippi Burning\").\nChaney was Black. Goodman and Schwerner were Jewish, though it was the latter who had already established via his racial justice efforts a reputation among the local Ku Klux Klan, whose members disparaged him with anti-Semitic slurs like \"Goatee\" and \"Jew Boy.\"\n\"They killed one n----r, one Jew, and a white man. I gave them all what I thought they deserved,\" Judge William Cox, a segregationist, said in 1967 of the sentencing. Initially, no one involved in the killings spent more than six years in jail. It wasn't until more than four decades later, in 2005, that Klan organizer Edgar Ray Killen was found guilty of three counts of manslaughter and sentenced to 60 years in prison, where he died in 2018.\nThis sobering history offers a lesson for the America of 2020, as it interrogates deep-seated racial inequality: that we can't hope to fully reckon with the legacy of White supremacy if we also, intentionally or not, endorse its central tenet of anti-Semitism.\nRecommended for your eyes and ears\nNetflix's latest reality dating show is \"Indian Matchmaking.\" It's a breezy watch, however it is not without its controversy.\nIn following a high-profile matchmaker's clients, the show highlights -- but doesn't really challenge -- the roles that colorism (the quest for a \"fair\" partner) and sexism play in dating and arranged marriages.\nAs Ishani Nath writes in The Juggernaut: \"In nearly every episode of 'Indian Matchmaking,' (the matchmaker) makes some mention of a candidate that is a good option partly because they are fair-skinned. It perpetuates South Asian discriminations based on skin tone, yet we never meet candidates who speak about how shadeism has impacted them or their romantic prospects. In the same way, the caste system's role in arranged marriages is never explored.\"\nSince its debut, the show has ranked among the 10 most-watched items on Netflix. It'll surely suck you in, too, and give you lots to think about.\nThe release of Netflix's \"The Baby-Sitter's Club,\" a remake of the classic children's book series, was followed by a short, 17-minute documentary called \"The Claudia Kishi Club.\"\nThe documentary delves into the character Claudia Kishi, a stereotype-busting Japanese-American girl. Kishi has long been an inspiration to viewers and the documentary investigates why she -- as well as representation generally -- is so important.\n\"It was genuinely chilling, and this time, the anti-Semitism was coming from people who looked like me,\" writes Soraya Nadia McDonald, who's Black and Jewish.\nIn a personal essay for ESPN's The Undefeated, titled \"I'm a Jew of color. I won't be quiet about anti-Semitism,\" McDonald reflects on the past week's rampant anti-Semitism, while also touching on the alienation she's experienced in Jewish and Black circles.

The organization focuses on criminal justice, health and other issues.\n\"Homicides depend on relatively vibrant activity patterns -- lots of people on the street,\" Richard Rosenfeld, a University of Missouri-St. Louis professor and co-author of the report, told the philanthropy's newsletter. \"When the streets are empty, the opportunities for all kinds of street crime go down.\"\nAnother shooting in Seattle's police-free autonomous zone kills man and critically injures boy\nThe researchers found that homicides in major cities this year were on the rise even before the pandemic hit.\nBut as the country continues to open, the report warned, the numbers of homicides will likely increase to a higher overall rate for 2020.\n\"We are deeply concerned that in the months ahead we may see more violence in the future,\" Thomas Abt, a senior fellow at the Council on Criminal Justice and the report's other author, told CNN.\nAbt said there appeared to be a connection between \"the legitimacy of the state, specifically law enforcement\" and levels of violence.\n\"As legitimacy drops, the people in these communities simply don't use the criminal justice system to mediate conflicts and instead turn to violence,\" he told the newsletter.\n\"We saw a significant increase in homicides after the unrest in Ferguson, Baltimore, Chicago and other places.

The jail also implemented new rules regarding proper procedures on how to accommodate inmates with religious headwear.\nLinda Sarsour, a political activist and Muslim woman in New York who also wears a hijab, has been arrested during protests several times. Sarsour said an officer once tried to force her to take off her hijab during the booking process, but she said it seemed mainly to be an issue of a lack of proper training.\n\"For effective police work, it doesn't make sense to ask Muslim women to take off their hijabs. For every way we are identified by the government, whether it's our passports, driver's license, Costco cards, college ID, you name it, this is how we look all the time in public,\" Sarsour told CNN.\n\"It's illogical for police departments to want Muslim women to take off their hijab because that is not the way we show up in the world. The idea of the database is that the mugshot goes in the database, and if you commit a crime again that database is used to identify you. So how are you going to identify us if the way we show up in your database is not how we show up in the rest of the world?\"\nTo force a Muslim woman to remove her hijab for a photo is \"dehumanizing and humiliating and strips you of your dignity,\" she added.\nAn employee at Chicken Express was sent home for refusing to take off her hijab\nThe death of George Floyd, a handcuffed Black man, while in Minneapolis police custody has triggered protests across the country, including the protest where Massri was arrested along with six others.\nAt one point during the protest, police attempted to \"form a skirmish line\" to block protesters from taking over the street, according to an arrest affidavit obtained by CNN. At the time of her arrest, Massri, who says she was rushing to help an injured protester, was confronted by multiple police in riot gear, she said in the petition.\nThe incident report also alleges that Massri hit an officer \"in the right bicep with a closed fist\" after he \"grabbed\" her to escort her out of the street after she refused orders to get out of the road. Massri was charged with battery, resisting an officer with violence and disorderly conduct.\n\"The officer is incorrect. If she unintentionally waved her hand and it made contact, that is not a crime,\" Wahid said.\n\"We are defending her criminal charges, which we strongly believe she committed no battery on a police office and did not intentionally strike the officer. I strongly believe she will be exonerated of that.\"\nMassri was released on $5,000 bond on June 11 and her arraignment hearing is set on July 10, her lawyer said."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/08/us/new-york-police-complaints/index.html", "headline": "An 8-year-old was handcuffed for carrying a stick.

An 11-year-old black boy stopped and frisked after a handshake. A 17-year-old black boy pushed up against a fence for carrying a backpack.\nThese are just a few recent substantiated allegations of misconduct against New York Police Department officers, according to a report by the Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB), a city agency that investigates and delivers findings on police misconduct complaints.\nThe CCRB report released Monday examines 112 fully investigated complaints involving young New Yorkers between January 2018 and June 2019. Taken together, they illustrate the fraught relationship between police and young people of color and illustrates one reason people are protesting against systemic racism in policing.\n\"Sadly, after years of witnessing news about police misconduct and possibly experiencing it themselves, even the youngest among us have an awareness of the tension that too often exists between the police and civilians,\" said CCRB Chair Fred Davie in a statement.\n\"As young New Yorkers lead the way in calling for change in our city following the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and countless others, it's time for the NYPD to re-consider how officers police our youth, address disparities in law enforcement, and commit to swift discipline when officers engage in misconduct.\"\nDemonstrators denouncing systemic racism in law enforcement gather in Brooklyn, New York, on June 4.\nAccording to the CCRB report, of 112 investigated complaints involving youth, 29% were substantiated, which means they occurred and were improper based on a preponderance of the evidence.\nIn addition, 42% were unsubstantiated, which means there is not enough evidence to determine whether misconduct occurred; 13% were exonerated, meaning the conduct occurred but was not improper; and 10% were unfounded, meaning the alleged conduct was found not to have occurred.\nThe report also offered several recommendations, including for the NYPD to include age and race in its data on use of force.\nIn a statement, the New York Police Department noted that in January, it launched a strategy to prevent and address youth crime.\n\"A top priority Commissioner (Dermot) Shea has set for the NYPD is to reimagine doing all we can to protect and serve New York City's kids,\" NYPD spokeswoman Sgt. Mary Frances O'Donnell said. \"After careful review, we accept each of the CCRB's thoughtful and constructive recommendations -- some of which are already in the process of being implemented and all of which will strengthen our new Youth Strategy.\"\nThere's a growing call to defund the police. Here's what it means\nMayor Bill de Blasio, facing calls from protesters to defund the police, said Sunday he plans to shift some funds from police to youth and social services.\nNew York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams said the CCRB data was shocking yet unsurprising in context.\n\"The over-policing of communities of more color clearly extends to our youth, and while these numbers are shocking, they aren't surprising in the context of an administration that maintains most NYPD funding in its executive budget while slashing youth services,\" he said.\n\"Now that some of that funding may shift, it's also critical we ask whether these encounters with law enforcement are necessary,\" he said. \"I suspect that many are not, and as we know, interactions with the system only perpetuate it.\"\nThe CCRB report details several instances of young black boys policed for innocuous activities such as high-fiving, running, carrying backpacks, playing with sticks or jaywalking. Here are a few of those cases.\n8-year-old handcuffed after playing with stick\nThese groups are fighting police reform 02:33\nIn March 2018, a group of black and Hispanic boys aged 8 to 14 were walking home, talking and laughing. Some of them played with sticks picked up from the ground, the CCRB report states.\nWhile on the sidewalk, multiple police cars approached. The officers exited their cars, one with his gun drawn, and told the boys to get against the wall. They complied and were all frisked by the officers, and no weapons were found, the report states. In all, eight to 10 police cars and 10 to 16 officers responded to the scene, the report states.\nThe lieutenant on scene decided to take the 8-year-old and 14-year-old to the station and processed them for disorderly conduct after officers reported seeing the children running with sticks, the report states. The two boys were transported there while handcuffed and in tears, the report says.\nDuring the CCRB investigation, two officers said they stopped the group because a radio run reported that a group of Hispanic men in their 20s with a machete and a stick were chasing and fighting others, the report states. However, the officers gave inconsistent statements about what the children were doing before they were stopped, including whether they were carrying anything.\nBased on the investigation, the CCRB recommended charges against the officers and the lieutenant. The charges are awaiting trial by the agency's Administrative Prosecution Unit, the report states.\nThe parents of the 8-year-old and 14-year-old filed complaints with the CCRB. The 8-year-old's mother said her son's dreams of becoming a police officer were over, and the 14-year-old's mother said the children were not allowed to call home nor did she get a call from the NYPD, the report states.\n11-year-old frisked after handshake\nOn one spring evening, an 11-year-old black boy walking to meet his mother encountered a group of adult men he recognized. As the boy greeted one of the men with a \"quick handshake/high-five,\" plainclothes Anti-Crime officers exited their vehicle and approached the group, the report states.\nThe adult men dispersed. One officer approached the boy and asked for his age, and then proceeded to frisk the boy's upper body and waist, the report states. A bystander told the officer that he shouldn't search someone under 13, but an officer replied that drugs can be given to younger children, the report states.\nThe officers then got back into their vehicle and drove away, the report says.\nThe CCRB investigation found by a preponderance of the evidence that the officer lacked sufficient justification to stop and frisk the boy. The board recommended command discipline B, which is used for misconduct that is more problematic than poor training but does not rise to the level of charges.\nHowever, the police commissioner downgraded the discipline to formalized training, the report states.\n17-year-old stopped for carrying a backpack\nIn another instance, a 17-year-old boy carrying a backpack was walking with a group of male friends through a New York City Housing Authority complex, talking and listening to music, the report states.\nA lieutenant and an officer in a nearby marked police vehicle exited their car, and according to video footage, the officer seized the boy and another person and pushed them against a fence, the report states.\nIn a CCRB interview, the lieutenant said he suspected the two of criminal possession of a weapon based on his prior knowledge of gang activity there, his initial observations of their age, statements they and their companions made when the officers arrived, as well as the fact that they were carrying bookbags \"despite the fact that it was long after the end of the school day,\" according to the report.\nThe lieutenant and officer also observed the group pushing each other and running back and forth, and the lieutenant assessed that they were \"acting kind of suspicious,\" the CCRB report states.\nThe CCRB investigation determined these observations did not give them reasonable suspicion to stop the two, and the board recommended the lieutenant and officer receive Command Discipline B, the report states.\nHowever, the police commissioner downgraded the discipline to Command Discipline A, a lesser punishment."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/12/us/oklahoma-city-derrick-scott/index.html", "headline": "Oklahoma City police release video of 2019 deadly arrest after protesters demand it", "published_date": "2020-06-12", "text": "(CNN)Oklahoma City police this week released body-camera video of a 2019 arrest of an armed black man who died not long after saying repeatedly during the encounter that he couldn't breathe -- footage that protesters had recently demanded.\nThe police footage of Derrick Scott's arrest was released to news media after demonstrators demanded the video in a recent Black Lives Matter protest in front of a city police station.\nThe demand came amid national uproar over last month's death in Minneapolis of George Floyd, who was not armed and had pleaded that he couldn't breathe as officers restrained him during an arrest. In that case, an officer is seen kneeling on the side of Floyd's neck, and this has moved some police departments around the world to start banning neck restraints.\nIn the Oklahoma City case, police have said Scott had a gun and ran from officers who approached him, and that all techniques used to restrain him were proper. The officers were cleared of criminal wrongdoing, Oklahoma City police say.\n'I can't breathe'\nThe incident happened on May 20, 2019, in Oklahoma City. Someone reported that a man had pulled a gun on another man in a parking lot outside a taco truck, according to a 911 call obtained by the Oklahoman newspaper.\nWhen officers arrived around 1:40 p.m., they found a suspect, Scott, and began talking to him, city police Capt. Larry Withrow said.\nScott, 42, initially puts both his hands in the air, but then turns and runs across the parking lot, the footage shows. At least two officers run after him.\nLess than 30 seconds later, an officer catches up and tackles Scott to the ground near a curb, and tells him to put his hands behind his back.\nThe officer straddles Scott's back briefly as he works to gain control.\nAbout 10 seconds after the tackle, Scott says \"I can't breathe\" for the first time.\n\"I don't care,\" the tackling officer, a man, responds, still trying to control Scott's arms.\nA second officer -- a woman -- yells, \"Keep your hands behind your back.\" The male officer tells Scott to keep his hand out of his pockets.\nThe female officer says, \"I'm going to Tase you,\" as she helps to subdue Scott.\n\"I can't breathe, please,\" Scott says, less than 15 seconds after he made the first plea. \"I can't breathe.\"\nThe male officer, then kneeling beside Scott, straddles him across the back, appearing to try pull Scott's arm behind his back to be handcuffed.\nWhen a third officer arrives, she tells Scott, \"Stop, stop resisting now.\"\nAs all three officers work to put him in handcuffs, Scott continues to repeat: \"I can't breathe.\"\nOnce Scott is in handcuffs, the male officer switches from the straddling position and puts one knee on the back of Scott's leg.\n'He's acting like he's unconscious'\nNearly a minute later, as the officers attempt to roll Scott over, one of the female officers can be heard saying, \"He's acting like he's unconscious.\" One of the officers removes a gun from Scott's pocket as he lies handcuffed, face down in the grass. Scott can no longer be heard on the recording.\nAbout three more minutes pass without Scott saying anything. As the officers discuss details of the takedown before rolling Scott over on his side, he appears to be unconscious.\nA female officer says, \"I'll hold this leg down, but we need to get his knee, like, a little bit bent so that if he is not faking.\"\n\"Stay with us, man,\" the male officer says, as he appears to tap on Scott while his knee remains on Scott's leg.\nIn an image captured on the camera, Scott appears passed out.\nThe male officers says, \"He's not really,\" and begins to knead his fist into Scott's chest. Scott's head bobs with no apparent response as the female officer says, \"He's fine.\" A third officer checks his pulse and says, \"He's got a pulse, he's breathing.\"\nDuring this time Scott's face remains mostly off-camera. He is silent and his legs do not appear to move while the officers wait for an ambulance, which officers had called because Scott appeared to be in medical distress, police said.\nAfter about nine minutes, paramedics arrive.\nScott appears alert as paramedics examine him\nThe officer who had been kneeling on Scott stands up and places his foot on Scott's leg as the paramedics inspect him. Together they sit him up, from the back. Scott is holding his own head up and seems to once again be alert. With a jolt he begins to moan and resist the police officers, and they forcefully hold him down on the ground.\nScott's moans descend into a deep cry as officers and paramedics try to stand him up. As the officers lift Scott, he raises his knees as if to try to kick the officers but does not make contact. They continue to lift him onto a stretcher and cuff him to the gurney.\nAfter he was loaded into the ambulance, paramedics told the officers that he had become unresponsive, according to police. One of the officers helped paramedics administer CPR, police said.\nScott was taken to a medical center, where he was pronounced dead at 2:56 p.m., a report from the state's chief medical examiner's office says. That was about an hour after Scott was arrested.\nHe died of a collapsed lung, medical examiner says\nThe cause of death was a collapsed right lung, according to a report from the medical examiner's office.\nPhysical restraint, recent methamphetamine use, asthma, bullous emphysema (an air pocket in the lung) and atherosclerotic heart disease were listed as contributing factors to his death.\nThere was \"no fatal trauma,\" according to the medical examiner's report.\nFollowing an investigation by the Oklahoma City Police Department, the Oklahoma County District Attorney's Office reviewed the case and determined there was nothing inappropriate on the part of the officers, nor any evidence of any misconduct by the officers, police said.\nScott's mother: 'No mother or father should have to go through this'\nScott did have asthma, his mother, Vickey Scott, told CNN.\nVickey Scott said she didn't learn of her son's death until four days after he died. She wasn't allowed to see his body until the day before his funeral, eight days after the incident, she said.\nShe said she hasn't watched all of the body camera video because it was too painful.\n\"No mother or father should have to go through this,\" she told CNN.\nPolice say the officers' moves were proper\nWithrow, the police department spokesman, said the techniques used to restrain Scott are taught at police academy.\nHe said:\n\u2022 About straddling Scott's back: \"(The officer) starts out up on his abdomen area, when he's straddling his back, trying to gain control of him. As they gain more control over the suspect and he's handcuffed, that officer is sliding farther down on the suspect's body to his waist and ultimately to his leg, not restricting any of his ability to breathe at that time.\n\u2022 The female officer who placed her knee across Scott's shoulder blade did this to gain a reasonable amount of control while not restricting airflow, and it offered the \"least likelihood of injuring a suspect.\""}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/08/us/black-police-officer-navigating-two-worlds-trnd/index.html", "headline": "What it's like to be a black police officer, navigating two turbulent worlds", "published_date": "2020-06-08", "text": "(CNN)De Lacy Davis remembers the moment vividly.\nThe New Jersey officer and a fellow officer were patrolling the streets of East Orange when a black woman and her daughter accidentally stepped in front of their police cruiser.\nThe other officer, who was white, rolled down his window.\n\"What the hell are you doing, you effin' ns?\" Davis recalled him saying, while censoring out the racial slur.\nDavis, who is black, is now retired from the force. But that moment 30-something years ago was just one of the many times he realized how some of his white colleagues viewed his community.\n\"The 'few bad apples' theory is a theory that I think is postulated by my colleagues and politicians to minimize the impact of this racism that is baked into the culture of policing,\" Davis said.\nAs the nation erupts in protests around the death of George Floyd and the greater issue of police brutality, African-American police officers are finding themselves navigating two worlds that are often at odds, and sometimes even at war, with each other: The black and the blue.\nProtesters and police officers engage in a discussion during a demonstration in Atlanta on May 31.\nThey are aware of the deep divide\nThe chasm between cops and communities of color has always been deep -- and it's getting deeper.\nBlack men are 2.5 times more likely to be killed by police than white men, according to one recent study. Black women are about 1.4 times more likely to be killed by police than white women.\nAnd yet, just 27% of white officers think the deaths of African-Americans in police encounters are a sign of a broader problem, according to a Pew survey. (57% of black officers think they are.)\nPolice brutality against blacks, Davis says, hasn't become the culture of policing; it has always been the culture of policing. Now, it's just getting filmed more.\nHe acknowledges that not all cops are bad. But, he says, put two bad apples in a bag of good ones, when you \"check on them next week, you'll see that you got worms through all the apples.\"\nThey've come to accept it\nIt is this world that black officers have to tread -- a delicate balance of reconciling allegiance and identity.\nRetired LAPD Sergeant Cheryl Dorsey knows this all too well.\nShe was working as a patrol officer during the 1992 Los Angeles riots, which started after four white officers were acquitted in the beating of a black man named Rodney King.\nAs a cop during those protests, Dorsey was called plenty of names. But she didn't take it personally because \"they don't know Cheryl. They just know the uniform,\" she said.\nCheryl Dorsey when she was a rookie police officer for the LAPD back in the '80s.\n\"I've never been torn. I'm able to be a black woman and a police officer and do my job professionally as I was trained, rely on my training and tactics so that I'm not aggressive when it's unnecessary,\" says Dorsey, who wrote an autobiography titled \"Black and Blue, The Creation of a Social Advocate.\"\nDavis knows this too.\nHe's been called a \"pig\" among other names at protests, but he had to understand that \"it's not you personally they're attacking. They're attacking the symbol that you represent.\"\nThey know where their loyalties lie\nIn the 1990s, Dorsey sat in court, testifying against a suspected criminal. But this suspect wasn't a civilian. Dorsey was testifying against one of her own brothers in blue.\nA white officer was accused of shooting and killing a black tow truck driver who failed to stop at his command.\nDorsey says she knew the risks of speaking out against another officer. Just like in the military, the camaraderie and kinship between officers is strong.\nBut one way to mend this rupture between cops and minorities is to stand up to abuse, Dorsey says.\nA Florida police officer pushed a kneeling protester to the ground. Then his black colleague stepped in\n\"You have to make a decision about who you want to be when you're out there in that uniform as a black police officer,\" she says. \"And I was clear of who I was from day one.\"\nThey know change is needed\nAnother way is to change perception by changing the reality. If people in the community see the police as the enemy, it's on the police to show them otherwise, Davis says.\nHe started with himself by forming Black Cops Against Police Brutality in 1991. By being on both sides, he was able to stand as an advocate for police reform while proving to his black community that he was one of them.\nDe Lacy Davis (center) marching with members of the Newark Police Dept.'s Honor Guard at the 1998 National Black Police Association's conference.\nIn 1995, Davis was invited to Paterson, New Jersey, after a 16-year-old black teen died at the hands of a police officer. The city was on edge.\n\"I promised them that when I came amongst them, I would come unarmed. There were times when it was extremely tense in the streets and they were threatening to kill a black cop. Yet I volunteered to be there, to stand with them,\" Davis says.\n\"When you take your oath to protect and serve the people, those are the risks that you take.\"\nSome things are changing\nThis is not to say things aren't changing. Sergeant Rashun Drayton and Captain Sonia Pruitt are proof.\nDrayton was the Santa Barbara Police Department's only black officer when he started his career over 20 years ago. Now, he says, his department has employees of multiple races.\nPruitt, who is also chairwoman of the National Black Police Association, was the first black woman to be named captain of the Montgomery County Police Department in Maryland.\nStill, police forces are by and large whiter than the communities they serve.\n\"When you see a police force of 90% white and they're patrolling a neighborhood that's a 100% black and they don't really know the people in the neighborhood, I don't know how that can be effective,\" Drayton says.\nHe says his department tries to regularly meet with community groups to talk about their experiences and how the police can better serve them.\nRayshun Drayton, right, and a community member at a festival in Santa Barbara.\nA standard police policy will help, they say\nDiversifying a police force and building trust with the community can take years. What needs to happen now is to standardize police policy across the nation, they say.\n\"There needs to be a completely consistent use-of-force policy across this country so that there can be no question about whether an officer used excessive force,\" Pruitt says.\n\"There should also be a national database to track officers who have accused of misconduct... so they would not be allowed to be hired anywhere else in the country.\"\nDavis became a police officer to finance his music career as a percussionist.\nDorsey became a police officer because she was a single mother who needed a \"good paying job with great benefits.\"\nPruitt became a police officer because she wanted \"freedom away from a desk.\"\nDrayton didn't even want to join the force, but was recruited at the nightclub where he was working.\nBut when they did, their duty went beyond the police motto of 'to protect and serve.' They had to push for change from within.\nBecause, they say, when you're black, the color of your skin carries a responsibility that goes beyond the color of your uniform."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/30/us/body-cameras-police-reform-challenges-trnd/index.html", "headline": "There's a renewed call for police body cameras. Here's why that may not be the right solution", "published_date": "2020-06-30", "text": "(CNN)The calls for police officers to wear body cameras is not new.\nThey came after Michael Brown was killed in 2014; after Walter Scott was fatally shot in 2015 and they're ringing out again.\nAs the cases of Breonna Taylor, George Floyd and Rayshard Brooks reignite protests over police violence, federal legislators, state officials and even law enforcement are again pointing to body cameras as a part of the solution.\nBut the evidence on whether the technology actually reduces police use of force incidents or changes how communities view departments is mixed.\nOne study of the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington D.C. -- one of the largest, most rigorous reviews of its kind -- found that body cameras had no significant impact on officer use of force, on civilian complaints, on whether a case was prosecuted and other outcomes. Another study of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department found that body cameras reduced use of force and civilian complaints only modestly.\n\"The key is to have realistic expectations about what body worn cameras can accomplish,\" says Michael White, co-author of \"Cops, Cameras, and Crisis: The Potential and the Perils of Police Body-Worn Cameras.\" \"... The one thing they can't do is fix decades of tension between police departments and the minority community.\"\nThe bottom line is this: Body cameras aren't an easy fix. Rather, experts say, they're only as effective as the departments that adopt them. And even then, they're just one piece of a very complicated system.\nHere's why.\nGetting cameras is easy. Maintaining them is expensive\nBy 2016, nearly half of law enforcement agencies in the US had acquired body-worn cameras, according to a Bureau of Justice Statistics survey. it's likely those numbers now are significantly higher because agencies have been quick to adopt the technology over the years, White said.\nBody cameras are seen charging at the West Valley City Police Department in Utah.\nBut acquiring body cameras is just the beginning.\n\"Buying the cameras and giving the cameras to officers is the easy part,\" says White, who is also a professor of criminology and criminal justice at Arizona State University. \"Then it gets extraordinarily complicated and expensive.\"\nThere's the cost of the cameras themselves -- which can range from about $400 to $800 apiece, depending on the camera make and model and how many a department orders.\nThere's the high costs associated with storing the video footage recorded by the cameras, which can be about $15 to $99 per officer per month. States have varying laws on how long video that could serve as potential evidence must be preserved. For all other video footage, police departments generally set the policies, ranging anywhere from 30 days in Boston to five years in Atlanta, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.\nThen there's the personnel costs associated with maintaining the footage, says Steven Casstevens, president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police and police chief for Buffalo Grove, Illinois. Police departments need to have employees who are reviewing the videos, responding to public records requests and performing other administrative functions.\nPolice departments don't always have a clear plan for their use\nFor body cameras to be effective, a police department needs to have a proper plan in place.\nThe Department of Justice has a checklist that law enforcement agencies can consult as they develop policies around how body cameras are used. The International Association of Chiefs of Police also has a set of guidelines around what to consider -- such as when a camera should be activated, who reviews the footage, etc.\nA police officer is seen wearing a body cam during a demonstration in Atlanta on May 31.\nBut in police departments around the US, that's not always the case.\n\"There are a variety of ways that a program can fail,\" White says. \"Certainly one of the ways is that a department hasn't properly planned out the program.\"\nAt least 19 states and Washington, D.C. require police departments to develop written policies around body cameras, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. In other localities, departments have taken it upon themselves to do so.\nDepartments acquire body cameras for a number of reasons. Some departments get them to improve officer accountability and community relations. Others may get them to enhance training, improve evidence quality or make cases easier to prosecute.\nNew York will require its state troopers to wear body cameras on patrol\nIn 2017, two organizations -- Upturn, a progressive nonprofit that advocates for justice around technology, and The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights -- evaluated the body camera policies of 75 local police departments on eight criteria. The measures included whether department rules specified when officers should record; and whether officers were allowed to review footage before writing reports.\nAt the time, no department fully satisfied all eight criteria, the scorecard found.\n\"[Body camera policies] are written oftentimes in conjunction with police unions and are oftentimes put in place to benefit department interests and officer interests in a way that I think don't live up to the promises that mayors and police chiefs have made to communities,\" says Harlan Yu, executive director of Upturn.\nBut Casstevens says police departments should develop their rules in consultation with the communities they serve.\n\"The arguments come in when a police department just decides to implement a camera program with no input from the public and just says, 'Well this is how we're going to run the program,'\" he says.\nBody cameras aren't always turned on\nOne issue that police departments specifically struggle with is getting officers to comply with turning their cameras on when they are supposed to, White says.\n\"All the goodwill that can be built up by a police chief with the community in terms of rolling out of body-worn camera program and whatever else they're trying to to do in terms of reform and engagement can be lost almost immediately if there's a critical incident like a shooting and there should have been footage, but there wasn't because the officer didn't activate,\" he says.\nA West Valley City patrol officer in Utah starts a body camera recording by pressing a button on his chest.\nMost agencies require officers to activate their body cameras when they are dispatched to a call for service, says Daniel Lawrence, a principal research associate at the Urban Institute. That might mean turning on the camera while the officer is in the car, or as they arrive onto the scene, he says.\nHaving body cameras on at all times can create privacy issues for both officers and members of the public, some in law enforcement argue. But there are technologies that aim to address the discretion an officer has in activating a body camera.\nSome models have a \"pre-event buffering\" setting that captures anywhere from 30 to 120 seconds of video from before the officer presses the button. Others will automatically turn on when an officer activates the car siren, exits the car or pulls their firearm, Lawrence says.\nIn February, the New York City Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB) released a report detailing the challenges the agency had in obtaining evidence from body cameras worn by New York police officers in the first half of 2019.\nOne of the most significant issues that investigators noted was the failure of officers to activate body cameras according to NYPD policy, the report stated. Some officers turned cameras on late, while others turned them off early. Still others didn't turn them on at all, according to the report.\nNew bodycams start recording with the draw of a gun\nReasons on why officers may not activate their body cameras vary, White said. In some cases, they might forget, while in cases where encounters escalate too quickly, they might not have enough time. Officers might also choose not to activate out of concern for an individual's privacy. And there may be times where an officer intentionally turns the camera off to escape accountability for misconduct, he says.\nA 2015 study of the Anaheim Police Department's body camera program found that though officers were expected to record all interactions with community members, the degree to which they did so varied widely. The study, conducted by the Urban Institute, found that officers activated their body cameras most often for crime-related interactions, even though such interactions only accounted for about 6% of their overall activities.\nBecause officers were less likely to activate their body cameras for more routine interactions, such as traffic stops, there could be challenges around investigating citizen complaints around those incidents, the authors wrote.\nEven when there is footage, PDs don't always release it\nFootage from body cameras, when it exists, isn't always made public.\nUpturn reviewed fatal police shootings tracked by the Washington Post, and found that out of 105 police killings captured by body cameras in 2017, there were 40 cases where footage wasn't made public. In 26 out of the 65 cases where video was released, the footage wasn't made available until one month or later, according to the analysis.\n\"We've seen many, many instances where there has been body worn camera footage, especially of a fatal police shooting,\" Yu says. \"And after those incidents, oftentimes police departments and cities and prosecutors don't release that footage in a timely manner.\"\nPolice shootings highlight concerns about body cameras\nIn some cases, prosecutors argue that body camera video shouldn't be publicly released until it's introduced as evidence in court, for fear that it could taint the jury pool. That was the case in the 2016 shooting of Sylville Smith at the hands of a Milwaukee police officer. Officer Dominique Heaggan-Brown was ultimately found not guilty.\nWhether or not body camera footage is subject to public disclosure depends on the laws in the state.\nConnecticut, Nevada, North Dakota, Oklahoma and Texas generally categorize body camera recordings as public records, though there are exceptions that allow police to withhold or redact certain videos, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL).\nIn other states, including Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Oregon and South Carolina, body camera footage isn't subject to open record requests, though some exceptions allow certain people to access recordings in certain situations, NCSL said.\nDemonstrators protest police brutality in Los Angeles on October 22, 2015.\nCasstevens says that when police departments withhold body camera footage, the department's policies should make clear to the public why it isn't being released.\n\"There should only be specific instances where the video should not be subject to FOIA,\" he says. \"And that's if you're protecting an ongoing investigation, or if you're trying to protect the victim's identity or something like that.\"\nBut if the goal of body cameras is to help provide accountability, other forms of video have proved more beneficial, Yu says.\nBystander video, not body camera footage, brought widespread attention to George Floyd's death and eventually resulted in protests across the country. A cell phone captured New York police officer Daniel Pantaleo holding Eric Garner in a chokehold.\nWhen it comes to policing the police, strong watchdogs are the exception\n\"It comes down to who has control of the footage, who is willing to release it to the public, to really show what's happening every day out on American streets,\" he says.\nThe nation has come a long way since calls for American police officers to wear body cameras first began. The technology is now the norm among police departments, and generally, communities view the cameras as a good thing.\nIt may seem ironic then, that the renewed calls for body cameras are now coinciding with calls to defund or abolish police.\nBut for body cameras to work as they were intended, experts say they need to be adopted along with other systemic reforms.\nBecause what's really at issue, Lawrence says, is how police departments treat civilians -- whether the cameras are on or not."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/21/us/analysis-portland-protests-federal-agents/index.html", "headline": "Neither side is backing down as federal agents and protesters clash in Portland", "published_date": "2020-07-21", "text": "Portland, Oregon (CNN)It's classic entrenchment with no end in sight.\nNeither side is backing down as protesters and federal agents continue to periodically clash in downtown Portland following an infusion of federal resources in the area, and the Trump administration persists in seeking political gain from ongoing tensions.\nTrump uses homeland security agency to fight his political battle against Democratic cities\n\"We want them to get the f*** out of our city,\" said Aaron, a Portland resident who withheld his full name as he stood outside a courthouse, protesting the increased presence of federal forces.\n\"I offered DHS support to help locally address the situation that's going on in Portland, and their only response was: please pack up and go home,\" said acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf in an interview with Fox News, adding, \"That's just not going to happen on my watch.\"\nWhat constitutes the situation Wolf describes is not one mutually accepted by those on different sides of the issue. The Trump administration says they are fighting \"anarchists.\" But protesters here on the ground in Portland tell CNN the President and his team are broad brushing an entire movement -- overwhelmingly peaceful, despite some periods of violence -- for purely political reasons.\nHide Caption\n65 of 65\nPhotos: The protests in Portland\nA protester passes a dumpster fire in Portland, Oregon, on Saturday, September 5. Saturday marked the 100th night of protests in the city since the death of George Floyd in late May.\nHide Caption\n1 of 65\nFor more than 50 days since the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police officers, demonstrators have gathered in Portland seeking accountability for law enforcement officers they believe have acted with impunity.\nAhead of the July Fourth weekend, the Trump administration dispatched teams of federal agents to the city as part of an effort to guard federal monuments. The President says federal resources were sent to protect federal property from destruction, but protesters say it is the large increase in federal forces that continues to fuel their anger.\nAn endless cycle\nWhile protests during the daylight hours have been overwhelmingly peaceful -- marked by marches, unity gatherings, and even the singing of songs -- clashes at night between some protesters and federal officers have resulted in the repeated vandalism of the US courthouse in downtown Portland and the tear gassing of demonstrators.\nIn one incident earlier this month at the courthouse, police say a man was arrested after assaulting a federal agent with a hammer.\nHeavily armed tactical agents holed up inside the federal facility will periodically appear on the street at night without warning and respond to escalations by some protesters, such as the launching of fireworks at the building or the removal of metal fencing erected to keep protesters away.\nDozens of moms formed a human shield to protect protesters from officers outside a federal courthouse in Portland\nWhen federal agents do exit the building, they do so in a massive show of force. Tear gas and crowd dispersant projectiles litter the air as demonstrators and journalists scramble to safety.\nWhile the efforts by federal officers to clear the area are momentarily successful, it remains part of an endless cycle: the protesters eventually return to the courthouse once the acrid smell of chemical gas partially dissipates.\nCertain encounters between demonstrators and law enforcement have generated widespread controversy and allegations of excessive use of force by federal agents. Earlier this month, a protester was seriously injured after the man was shot in the head with impact munitions used for riot control.\nOn Saturday night, 53-year-old Navy veteran Chris Davis was beaten by a federal agent with a baton outside the court house and sprayed with pepper spray at close range.\n\"I was going to ask why they weren't living up to their oath of office, the Constitution,\" said Chris Davis. \"All I wanted to do was ask them why.\"\nCNN has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security and US Marshals for comment on the incident.\nA Navy veteran says he was beaten and pepper sprayed by authorities while attending his first protest in Portland\nIn another viral video that sparked national outrage from activists and government officials, two federal officers in camouflage tactical uniforms approached and detained a man, placed him inside an unmarked van and drove away.\nAfter refusing for hours to respond to CNN's requests for comment on the incident, US Customs and Border Protection eventually released a statement identifying the officers as belonging to that agency, and indicated the man was wanted for questioning regarding a possible crime. However, a DHS official said he was later released.\nThis incident was too much for Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon, who described the actions by CBP agents in Orwellian terms.\n\"Authoritarian governments, not democratic republics, send unmarked authorities after protesters,\" he tweeted. \"These Trump/Barr tactics designed to eliminate any accountability are absolutely unacceptable in America, and must end.\"\nIn part due to the viral video, the top prosecutor in Oregon is calling on watchdog agencies at the Department of Homeland Security and Justice Department to investigate the actions of federal officers in Portland. Three powerful Democratic committee chairs in the House of Representatives are now calling for the same.\nAn exaggerated national threat\nAs some senior government officials call for investigations into federal action, the brinksmanship on the ground in Portland remains ongoing. Protesters calling for an end to racial injustice square off with agents championed by a President who continues to use unrest in the city as political ammunition in his attempts to portray himself as tough on crime.\nAlthough the President and senior DHS officials have portrayed Portland as a city under siege, the picture on the ground is markedly different from the image of bedlam they are attempting to project.\nFederal agents use teargas and projectiles to disperse protesters after some protesters tore down a fence fronting the US courthouse in Portland on July 20.\nRather than widespread chaos, the epicenter of daytime and nightly protests has largely been relegated to the city block housing the federal courthouse.\nSome local journalists who have covered the protests here since the beginning have also observed an apparent broad brushing by law enforcement, who they say tend to lump all demonstrators -- including the overwhelming majority of peaceful protesters -- into one group of suspected criminals.\n\"The way that law enforcement and even public officials here have been talking about these protests is really in a sweeping, all-encompassing way, saying this whole crowd of people are committing a riot or committing a crime as opposed to a number of them,\" said reporter Alex Zielinski of Portland Mercury in an interview with CNN. \"So I think that's the way federal police are operating. They see anyone involved in these protests as someone who is committing a crime.\"\nThe protesters are not alone in their antipathy towards the federal government. Local elected officials in Portland have repeatedly called for the disbanding of Trump's federal cavalry so they can address the protests themselves.\n\"What they are doing is sharply escalating the situation,\" said Portland mayor Ted Wheeler in an interview Sunday with CNN's Jake Tapper. \"Their presence is actually leading to more violence and more vandalism and it's not helping the situation at all. They're not wanted here.\"\nDespite reality checks from those who have seen the Portland situation up close, Trump continues to use the city's ongoing protest movement for political gain.\nTrump administration preparing to send federal agents to Chicago\nAnd Portland is not the only city facing the President's scrutiny.\nOn Monday, Trump said he will also send federal law enforcement to other cities, \"all run by very liberal Democrats,\" in the latest example of his \"law and order\" messaging. However, despite the President's attempts to portray these cities as being in states of chaos, there is no indication any of them have experienced the degree of calamity Trump is describing to the American people.\nIt is unclear how the escalated tensions in Portland will be resolved. With Trump and DHS ratcheting up their heated rhetoric to label protesters, and demonstrators angered and steeled by the caustic descriptions of their movement, no clear path to resolution exists as demonstrators and rioters continue to gather outside the federal courthouse.\n\"It's ironic that we're getting tear gassed for protesting against aggressive police tactics,\" said Eric, a protester from Washington State who refused to give his surname for fear of being targeted by authorities.\n\"We're not leaving,\" he said. \"I think it says more about them than us when the feds respond to our demands for justice with tear gas and smoke bombs.\"\nCNN's Priscilla Alvarez, Greg Clary, Conor Powell, Manu Raju, Geneva Sands, Jennifer Selva, Hollie Silverman, Konstantin Toropin and Amir Vera contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/21/us/hip-hop-black-lives-matter-trnd/index.html", "headline": "10 times hip-hop told you about Black lives who mattered", "published_date": "2020-06-21", "text": "(CNN)Hip-hop has been on this.\nLong before DaBaby did a Black Lives Matter remix of \"Rockstar\" or LL Cool J freestyled about George Floyd or J.

I had asked some young men that I had seen on bicycles if they would be willing to go fetch some supplies like water, baking soda, baby wipes and milk,\" Caraway said, noting that he handed them $60 to buy the supplies from stores that were still open further up north.\n\"I only had given the money because they had stated that they would be willing to help, but they didn't have money,\" he added. \"Before they left (I asked them) to help me build a barricade.\"\nEric Stoneman, 22, was also at the protest. He saw Caraway there.\n\"As soon as I saw him identified as a person of interest, I was frustrated,\" Stoneman told CNN. While the two don't know each other personally, Stoneman said they interacted briefly at the protest.\n\"In terms of what I saw, honestly more than anything he was helpful and respectful. He came up to me and some other people saying that we need to help others get more cover with loose boards and trash cans,\" he said. \"Someone tried to empty out a trash can, but he said, 'Grab the empty ones. We're not trying to make a mess.'\"\nHis first time at a protest, he says\nThis was the first time Caraway, who works as an extractor at a medical cannabis company, participated in any sort of protest, Caraway told CNN.\nThrough his lawyer, Caraway said he has no political affiliation and was only doing what he could to help others. \"Nathan is not a member of any organization whatsoever, let alone Antifa or any other group,\" his lawyer Sean Walton said.\nDaniel Ortiz, a pastor who's known Caraway for over two years, told CNN, \"My heart broke for him. I know him and I know that's not the type of person he is. He's justice-oriented. He wants to help others and bridge the gap between people. He's not a divider. He's a uniter.\"\nIf you're planning to take part in protests, know your rights. Read this.\nCaraway and his lawyers did not comment on whether they will be taking any legal action towards anyone. What they want to do first and foremost is clear his name, his other lawyer Jalyn Parks said.\n\"For him to literally be in the act of trying to help people and better his community. With one video, he's been vilified and afraid for his life,\" Parks added. \"The goal here is to tell his story so that people know and understand some of the consequences of spreading misinformation.\"\nParks acknowledged on Thursday the existence of a second video that appears to show Caraway walking with a group of men who were throwing items at buildings that Friday night. In that video, Caraway can be heard aggressively yelling at bystanders on the street. Parks says he was telling them to get back inside so as not to further incite the crowd. \"In very tense moments, he was trying to keep the peace,\" she said.\nWhile he's still in fear for his life, Caraway said he has forgiven all parties involved in spreading the misinformation, including Trump.\n\"I forgive him and I have no resentment in my heart,\" Caraway said regarding Trump. \"I'd like to see his office make our country a better place.\"\nGoogle, which owns YouTube, did not respond to a request for comment.

Last month, Florida lawyer and businessman Benndrick Watson filed a lawsuit against Wells Fargo, accusing a bank manager of using a racial slur while he was trying to open an account.\nWatson had a personal checking account at the bank, and was at a branch near Tampa to open a business account for his law firm in April last year. While the banker was searching through corporate records, Watson told CNN, he discovered that he owned a record label business and started asking questions.\n\"It's almost like they didn't believe I had a business,\" he said.\nThe teller brought in a branch manager who started going through Watson's information on his computer. Then the manager suddenly called him a N***er.\n\"My jaw just literally dropped -- I was scared, I said, 'did he really say that?'\" Watson said. \"I sat back. He started talking. He started scaring me. It was hard to explain.\"\nThe branch manager apologized, saying he did not mean it and describing it as \"a slip of the tongue,\" Watson said. He quickly gathered his things and rushed to his car.\n\"When you go to the bank, your guard is down. You don't expect to be called a racist word\"\nBenndrick Watson\n\"When you go to the bank, your guard is down. You don't expect to be called a racist word,\" Watson said. \"I was a customer in this bank. I had been to this bank. It physically hurt.\"\nWatson said he wants to bring awareness to his case with the hope that it'll help banks improve their relationships with Black small business owners.\nShortly after the incident, his attorney Rodal reached out to the bank on behalf of his client. The regional manager wrote a letter to Watson apologizing and describing the incident as unacceptable.\n\"Even though it seems the utterance of the offensive term was unintentional, we understand that it made your client uncomfortable, and for good reason,\" the regional manager wrote in the letter provided to CNN by Rodal. \"Wells Fargo does not tolerate that kind of language, under any circumstances, and we have taken corrective action against the former branch manager.\"\nIn a statement to CNN, Wells Fargo said the branch manager resigned as the bank was preparing to fire him and is not eligible for rehire.\n\"We are very sorry and deeply apologize to him for what must have been a horrible experience,\" the statement said. \"Wells Fargo does not tolerate discrimination of any kind. We look into all allegations of discrimination regarding our customers and employees very seriously and take action to address them.\"\nA teller refused to deposit his check\nMichigan resident Sauntore Thomas recently reached an agreement with a bank over a racial discrimination lawsuit he filed this year after a teller refused to deposit his checks.\nIn January, he'd gone to a TCF Bank branch in Livonia to open a savings account and deposit checks from a settlement in a racial discrimination case against his former employer. He had a checking account at the bank.\nA bank employee asked how he got the money, and called the police to report that he was attempting to deposit fraudulent checks, the lawsuit said. Four police officers arrived and questioned him.\n\"Something else was afoot here,\" his attorney, Deborah Gordon, said at the time. \"And in my opinion there's only one thing: banking while Black.\"\nSauntore went to a different bank, opened an account and deposited his checks without any issues. In a statement to CNN at the time, the bank apologized.\n\"Local police should not have been involved. We strongly condemn racism and discrimination of any kind,\" it said. \"We take extra precautions involving large deposits and requests for cash and in this case, we were unable to validate the checks.\"\nFollowing the filing of the lawsuit, he has since had a meeting with TCF board chairman Gary Torgow.\n\"He feels comfortable with their assurances that the incident that occurred was an unfortunate mistake and is not reflective of the way the bank does business,\" Gordon told CNN.\nThe law makes it difficult to seek redress\nSince Floyd's killing by a police officer in Minneapolis and demands for justice and corporate accountability, there are growing calls for banks to address racial profiling.\nRacial discrimination has happened at banks for years with limited legal recourse, legal experts said.\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1964 outlawed discrimination in businesses such as theaters, restaurants and hotels but banks are not on the list, which makes it hard for people profiled in financial institutions to win lawsuits in federal court, according to Gordon, a civil rights attorney.\n\"This act was written in the middle of the Civil Rights Movement when African Americans were dealing with being unable to sit at a lunch counter, stay in a motel or go to a movie,\" Gordon said. \"The 1964 act sought to address only these violations that were very much in the public eye. The act needs to be amended but I doubt that it will be.\"\nSome states have passed measures that address the loopholes. In Michigan, a Civil Rights Act passed in 1976 covers most everything, Gordon added.\nSome banks are pledging to make efforts to ensure a welcoming environment for minorities.\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1964 outlawed discrimination in some businesses but banks are not on the list\n\"As a company based in Minneapolis, we asked questions at the time about how we could help enact changes to the systemic inequities, socially and financially, that have contributed to what was a recurring tragedy,\" US Bank Chief Diversity Officer Greg Cunningham said.\nHe urged large companies and their leaders to develop meaningful relationships with Black-owned businesses and actively denounce systemic racism.\nWells Fargo said it's committed to a series of changes including supporting Black businesses to ensure the company's diversity and inclusion efforts lead to meaningful change.\n\"All managers will be required to participate in a new live and interactive program specifically designed to tackle today's challenges,\" Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf said last month. \"This will go well beyond the current standardized training that is inadequate to the challenge.\"\nThe bank has pledged to use such incidents to train employees and ensure better services.\n\"The most useful and valuable approach we can take with each customer interaction and our employees is to learn from them and continue to make sure our policies, processes and training support fairness and equity for every customer or noncustomer we interact with,\" it said.\nTCF has rolled out mandatory unconscious bias training for employees and conducted a review of its policies and procedures to ensure equal treatment of all customers, said Randi Berris, a senior vice president and director of corporate communications at the bank.\nBut as businesses take a hard look at their policies in the wake of Floyd's killing, some bank leaders admit more work needs to be done to build trust with minorities."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/04/us/outside-agitator-label-history-trnd/index.html", "headline": "5 reasons why experts say we should be wary of the 'outside agitator' narrative", "published_date": "2020-06-04", "text": "(CNN)As protests over police brutality and systemic racism sweep the nation, authorities have partly blamed incidents of property destruction and violence on people they deem 'outside agitators.'\nFederal law enforcement officials pointed to groups including anarchists, white supremacists and far-left extremists, while President Donald Trump has focused just on Antifa and the far left.\nOther authorities have leveled allegations about foreign influences. Local officials have also used the term to refer to those who join protests from out of town.\nThis week, federal prosecutors in Nevada charged three men who allegedly identify with the Boogaloo movement -- a group often associated with far-right extremist ideology that wants to initiate a civil war.\nWhat we do and don't know about the extremists taking part in riots across the US\nWhile officials are still trying to quantify just how significant a role outside groups are playing in the unrest, it's clear that the label 'outside agitators' has been used broadly to describe a number of different groups.\nAnd that's something experts and scholars say we should be careful of.\nThe narrative of the 'outside agitator' has long been used to undermine protest movements in the United States. Even Civil Rights Movement leader Martin Luther King Jr. -- often invoked in conversations today about how people should demonstrate -- was referred to by Southern white people as an outside agitator.\nHere's why experts say we should be wary of that narrative.\nIt's been used to discredit protests\nFraming the unrest as caused solely by outside agitators suggests that the protesters involved in social change movements are carrying out someone else's nefarious agenda, rather than mobilizing over legitimate concerns of their own, said Aldon Morris, professor of sociology and African American history at Northwestern University.\n\"It suggests that they don't have the wherewithal, the agency, to organize and to mobilize and to lead protest movements,\" Morris told CNN. \"In that sense then, if they are incapable of doing that, then surely it must be the work of others outside the protest community.\"\n99 years ago today, America was shaken by one of its deadliest acts of racial violence\nDuring the 1921 Tulsa race massacre, when a white mob attacked black residents and burned black-owned businesses in Tulsa's Greenwood District, Oklahoma leaders and white Tulsans blamed outside agitators for inciting black residents to seek racial equality.\nThat included scholar, teacher and activist W.E.B. DuBois, who was described by Oklahoma's governor at the time as \"an agitator of the worst type.\"\nDuBois had visited Oklahoma a few months earlier and likely raised consciousness about injustices against black people, wrote Alfred Brophy in the book \"Reconstructing the Dreamland: The Tulsa Riot of 1921.\" And though it was a white mob that attacked the city's black community, officials and police suggested that DuBois and the black press provoked it.\nAn image shows the aftermath of the white mobs that attacked black residents and businesses of the Greenwood District in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\nMorris, who has studied social movements for decades, said that data has shown claims about outsiders playing a significant role in demonstrations are unproven. In reality, most of the people leading and participating in demonstrations are from oppressed communities.\nIn Minnesota, evidence of outside involvement has so far been thin.\nThe Star Tribune reported last week that data from Hennepin County showed more Minnesotans were arrested during protests than people from out of state. An analysis conducted by the local TV station KARE found similar results.\nThe data is inconclusive, and at least one report alleged that a man from out of state encouraged violence against law enforcement. But such actors are likely not the norm, Morris said.\n\"I am not then saying that there aren't agent provocateurs operating in the current uprisings,\" he said. \"But there can be little doubt that this is a major movement by people with legitimate grievances and their allies.\"\nIt distracts from the underlying causes\nEmphasizing the destruction of property and the role of outsiders in demonstrations distracts from the issues that prompted people to take to the streets, Morris said.\nThough demonstrations in cities across the US were sparked by the killing of George Floyd, the anger and frustration goes beyond that. Many protesters are also driven to demonstrate because of systemic racism, wealth and income disparities and the disproportionate impact that the coronavirus pandemic has had on people of color.\nUS black-white inequality in 6 stark charts\nAttributing the unrest to outsiders implies that the majority of oppressed people are content with the status quo, said Morris. It's also an attitude that was often displayed by white Southerners during the 1960s Civil Rights Movement.\n\"Southern white segregationists believed that 'their Negroes' were content with the social conditions under which they lived, that they did not have any legitimate grievances and that there's no way that they would rebel under the Jim Crow system,\" he said.\nThis dynamic played out during the 1964 Mississippi Summer Project, said Kathleen Fitzgerald, a teaching assistant professor of sociology at the University of North Carolina.\nInvestigators locked up the charred station wagon three civil rights activists who went missing during the 1964 Freedom Summer Project in Mississippi.\nThe campaign, organized by the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), was intended to highlight the disenfranchisement of black people in Mississippi. That year, a group of mostly white college students from the North traveled to Mississippi to help register black voters and open up freedom schools to teach literacy and civics. Southerners dismissed the volunteers as outsiders.\n\"When they use that narrative, it's an assumption that no locals would agree with these actions and no locals are on board,\" Fitzgerald said. \"And that's certainly not true.\"\nIt ignores the fact that movements are connected\nOrganizers and activists often travel beyond their own regions to demonstrate around causes that they have a stake in. Automatically casting suspicion on all protesters from out of town ignores the way that social change movements work, Morris said.\n\"Black people have never been just a localized population,\" he said. \"We have national grievances, and it would be narrow minded to think that black people therefore would not be involved in social change movements that were aimed at trying to liberate the black community overall.\"\nRev. Ralph Abernathy and Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. lead a column of demonstrators as they attempt to march on Birmingham, Alabama, on April 12, 1963.\nThe same was true during the Civil Rights Movement. Martin Luther King Jr. and other activists involved in the Southern Christian Leadership Conference were often called in to assist with demonstrations in cities across the South.\nWhen civil rights leaders organized a campaign in 1963 to bring attention to segregation in Birmingham, Alabama, white religious leaders described King and other protesters as outsiders stirring up trouble.\nKing specifically rejected the \"narrow, provincial 'outside agitator' idea.\"\n\"I cannot sit idly by in Atlanta and not be concerned about what happens in Birmingham,\" he famously wrote in Letter from a Birmingham Jail. \"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.\"\nIt's used to justify violence against protesters\nThe outside agitator narrative can also be used to justify violence against protesters.\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio defended the city's police department after a video appeared to show an NYPD truck plowing through a crowd of people during a protest. In doing so, he cited the influence of outsiders.\nPolice brutality prompted the protests. In some cities, the police response only proved the protesters' point\n\"It's clear that a different element has come into play here who are trying to hurt police officers and trying to damage their vehicles,\" de Blasio said on Saturday.\nTrump has also invoked outside groups when threatening military force.\nIn a speech earlier this week, Trump said that the nation \"has been gripped by professional anarchists, violent mobs, or, arsonists, looters, criminals, rider rioters, antifa and others\" and said he had directed governors to deploy the National Guard to \"dominate the streets.\"\nDuring and after the remarks, peaceful protesters outside the White House gates were dispersed with tear gas, flash grenades and rubber bullets -- apparently so the President could visit a nearby church.\n\"When you can delegitimize authentic expressions of discontent, then you can mobilize violent force against them,\" Morris said.\nIt prevents the movement from growing\nFinally, focusing attention on property destruction and casting demonstrations as being corrupted by outside agitators can turn away people who might otherwise be supportive.\nThe outside agitator narrative has been used to deter sympathy for past movements, and the same is happening today, said Fitzgerald.\nWhat protesters say is fueling their anger\nGetting large numbers of people to mobilize in the streets is critical for social movements. When officials suggest that those social movements are being influenced by people with varying agendas, some potential supporters may equate property destruction with the loss of black life and choose to stay at home, she said.\n\"It's meant to make us question what before we wouldn't have questioned,\" Fitzgerald said.\nThe demonstrations playing out across the the nation right now have complex roots. And though there may be bad actors who are attempting to exploit the pain of communities, there is no one simple narrative.\nSo as some authorities blame outsiders for the unrest that's playing out, experts say they might do well to consider what brought people to the streets in the first place."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/20/us/racist-google-question-blake/index.html", "headline": "'Am I racist?'

Support for the Black Lives Matter movement has surged, and White people are snapping up books like \"How to Be an Antiracist\" and \"White Fragility.\"\nBut a Google search and a few books can only go so far in answering such a complex and loaded query.\nSo CNN called some activists, psychologists and historians and asked them: How would you help White people answer that question?\nFirst, let's define racism\nThe first step in self-knowledge is defining what it means to be a racist, and defining racism itself.\nWornie Reed, a veteran civil rights activist and the director of the Race and Social Policy Center at Virginia Tech, says, \"A racist person is a person who commits racist acts.\"\nThose acts, he says, are backed by a set of beliefs that support the idea that race determines human traits and capacities and makes one race automatically superior to another.\n\"If they do racist things, I'm willing to call them a racist,\" Reed says. \"You can be a racist even if you don't intend to be one.\"\nA protester holds up a homemade sign during a march on June 12, 2020, in New York City.\nAnd racism?

People can act and think in racist ways without knowing it.\nA protester raises his fist during a rally June 1, 2020, in Las Vegas.\nA classic example of this was a famous experiment in which researchers sent 5,000 fictitious resumes in response to employment ads. Some applicants had White-sounding names such as \"Brendan,\" while others had Black-sounding names, like \"Jamal.\"\nThe applicants with White-sounding names were 50% more likely to get calls for interviews than their Black-sounding counterparts.\nPeople might not think that they have control over racism, and they can't ever get rid of it. It's absolutely within their control.\nAngela Bell, psychology professor\nSome scholars, though, have issues with terms like \"implicit bias.\" They feel it offers people an excuse to justify their racism by claiming, \"My subconscious made me do it.\"\n\"The term racial bias perpetuates the notion that racism is beyond your control, and that's often not the case,\" says Bell, the psychology professor. \"People might not think that they have control over racism, and they can't ever get rid of it. It's absolutely within their control.\"\nIt doesn't matter if you voted for Obama\nIt can be fiendishly difficult, though, for people to see racism in themselves, says Bell, who studies how people fail to recognize their own racism.\nSome of that is because of what psychologists call \"moral licensing and credentialing.\" Translation: A White liberal who brags, \"I would have voted for Obama a third time if I could,\" may be trying to signal that he or she is beyond racism.\nIf you bring Mother Teresa out of the grave and put her in charge of any criminal justice system in any state, she would be -- unless she changed the system -- the greatest practicing racist in the state.\nWornie Reed, activist and scholar\nIn 2009, Stanford University researchers released a study which found that expressing support for Obama made some people feel justified in favoring Whites over Blacks.\nDaniel Effron, who helped conduct the study, said at the time:\n\"This is the psychological equivalent of when people in casual conversation say something like, 'many of my best friends are black.' They say that because they're about to say something else that they're concerned might be construed as prejudiced.\"\nSupporters wave \"Forward\" signs as President Barack Obama speaks at a rally on September 2, 2012, in Boulder, Colorado.\nThere's also the tendency for people to evaluate themselves as superior to others, Bell says.\nShe cites an experiment she helped conduct in which she asked college students to fill out an online questionnaire asking if they had ever engaged in racist behaviors, such as using the N-word.\nMonths later, the same participants were asked to review similar responses from randomly selected students. The catch was that they were actually reviewing their own answers, but they didn't know it.\n\"People evaluated themselves as less racist as the other person,\" Bell says, \"even though the other person was them.\"\nIndividual racism isn't as harmful as institutional racism\nPeople have different ideas about how to get rid of racism.

Naison, however, poses a few questions that may give you a clue.\nAre you surprised when you meet a Black person whose command of language or speech or writing is of the highest order?\nDo you assume that when you meet a Black person in an athletic competition that he or she will be stronger or faster than you?\nDo you feel anxiety when a group of young Black men walk down the street toward you, or a twinge of fear when a Black man checks your gas meter or does home repairs?\nA woman holds a protest sign in Oakland, California, on June 1, 2020.\nIf you answered yes to these you might be a racist, Naison says.\nHe adds that Black people who come in contact with you will probably know you're a racist before you do. Blacks can often read White people's body language when they're experiencing these racist thoughts, he says. It could be something as simple as speeding up your walk when a Black man approaches on the street or hesitating to open your door when a Black man is ringing the bell.\nNaison says a majority of Whites practice what he calls \"aversive racism,\" or engaging in behavior -- some of it unconscious -- \"which lets Black people know they are uncomfortable around them.\"\nHow to not be racist\nOne of the biggest obstacles to fighting racism is despair. There's a belief that racism will never be eliminated because it always adapts to survive, and humans are too tribal to look past superficial differences in others.\nBut the modern framework of racism -- a racial hierarchy with White on top and Black on bottom -- is a relatively recent fabrication. The notion that people with darker skin are inherently inferior was contrived around 500 years ago by Europeans to justify slavery and colonial conquest, scholars say.\nHistory lessons won't prevent someone from being a racist. But something else can: genuine, sustained personal relationships with people of color.\nSustained friendships with people of other races can break down biases, scholars say.\n\"Reading books is a good thing, and participating in study groups is fine, but making your social networks genuinely diverse is critical,\" says Naison, the Fordham professor. \"You can't live in a White bubble.\"\nMost White people, however, are socially isolated from people of other ethnicities, he says. Naison says he goes to the homes and celebrations of White friends and hardly ever sees any people of color.\n\"And these are people who support every possible justice issue, and who march in Black Lives Matter protests,\" he says.\nNaison says he's never had to ask Google, \"Am I a racist?\" because his world is full of people of color who will tell him if he is being a racist.\n\"I've had a great life and I've learned to make this happen,\" he says. \"If I can do it, you can too.\"\nMaybe starting that journey begins with a less self-centered question for Google.\nInstead of \"Am I racist?\" ask yourself:\nWhat am I doing to stop the racism I see in the world?"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/29/us/instagram-black-students-at-pages-race-issues-trnd/index.html", "headline": "Students using Instagram to reveal what it is like to be 'Black at' private high schools", "published_date": "2020-06-29", "text": "(CNN)In high school, Aigner Picou was an honor student, held a job, led a club, participated in community service and played an instrument.

Glass said in a statement to CNN the school is built around \"principles of mutual respect in a diverse community\" and will take actions to address the school not yet living up to its aspirations.\nMore than half of the students at the school identify as Black, Asian or LatinX, Glass said.\nExeter director of equity and inclusion Stephanie Bramlett said in a statement on Instagram that changes are already underway including anti-racism training offered for faculty and staff and changes to racial climate assessment, committee structures and responding to community feedback underway.\n\"This list is not exhaustive and will grow and become more specific,\" Bramlett said. \"Exeter is committed to racial equity and lasting change.\"\nThe response from students has been mixed.\nWhen they started their page, Jackson and John-Terry said they were overloaded with racist comments toward Black people. The comments brought Jackson to tears.\nAnd within the first two days, they received about 15 fake submissions intending to undermine their efforts, they said.\nBut, they said, the bad is far exceeded by the good. Students, alumni and faculty have all reached out to say how their eyes have been opened to these experiences and to ask how they can help the page's efforts.\nAnd among the page administrators, a community has started to form. Black former and current students in states all over the US have gathered on a group thread, John-Terry said.\nThey keep each other going with words of encouragement, share resources and offer support in every way they can, she said.\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story misspelled the first name of Skye Jackson, a student at Episcopal High School in Virginia."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/23/us/do-online-petitions-work-trnd/index.html", "headline": "Online petitions work best when you do more than just sign", "published_date": "2020-06-23", "text": "(CNN)An online petition demanding justice for George Floyd has gathered more than 18 million signatures since last month. It's the most signed petition on Change.org but far from the only one online.\nThousands have signed for justice in Breonna Taylor's case too. Others have showed their support in renaming the city of Columbus, Ohio. And more than 160,000 have signed a petition asking US leaders to restore funding to the World Health Organization.\nThere's a myriad of petitions online calling for change in issues ranging from social justice to environmental rights to healthcare.\nBut do they make a difference?\nWell, it's complicated.\nThere's no true measure of success for petitions. That's because, in order to be effective, they almost always are paired with dozens more actions carried out by the organization or individuals who drafted the petition and by the signers themselves.\nSo while it's often hard to credit outcome -- like new legislation or a company's decision -- directly back to the signatures that may have pushed for that result, those who study digital activism and those who help craft campaigns say the greatest power of petitions is bringing together crowds behind an ask and often acting as an entry point for many of the signers' journey to activism.\n\"Learning about an issue through an online petition or other digital campaign can lead folks to do further research and reading online, which can lead to higher levels of involvement and commitment,\" says Rosemary Clark-Parsons, the associate director of the University of Pennsylvania's Center on Digital Culture and Society.\nIs it 'slacktivism'?\nCritics have often labeled online petitions as another form of \"slacktivism,\" pointing to their low-risk nature that doesn't commit its signers to any further action other than the click of a button. But it's exactly that ease and accessibility which make petitions powerful tools, Clark-Parsons says.\n\"Both research and anecdotal evidence tell us that most people will not take part in activism that requires great risk or high levels of commitment,\" Clark-Parsons said. \"What critics refer to as 'slacktivism' can actually create an alternative outlet for those who would typically not get involved in any movement at all.\"\nWith the help of petitions, organizers and movement leaders can visualize who their supporters are and who are \"the people who agree with their mission but aren't willing to take major actions to support it just yet,\" she says.\nThe 1st Trump White House Petition is in: Release tax returns\n\"This is powerful data about your extended network of support,\" she says. \"Once you can see your passive allies, you can work toward encouraging them to become active allies and join the ranks of supporters who are actively fighting alongside you for the cause.\"\nSo while it may just begin with the click of a button, piling your signature on a list of others calling for change means you're publicly stating your support for an issue. And that, Randy Paynter says, is a big deal.\n\"That's very likely to ... influence where you spend your money in the future, how you vote, how you influence your friends,\" says Paynter, the founder and CEO of Care2, a site that hosts petitions.\nHe says those who add their signature to a petition are then more likely to get involved in the issues those campaigns target -- and more likely to donate to nonprofits working around those issues. And he's got the numbers to prove it.\n\"We've recruited over a hundred million individuals over the last 20 years to support several thousand nonprofit organizations,\" he says. \"Through those individuals, organizations have raised over a billion dollars.\"\nThey're almost always part of a larger puzzle\nBut donations are just one part of involvement. Petitions offer an opportunity for organizations to step in and guide their newfound supporters into a multitude of next steps in working toward a cause, turning them from just supportive bystanders into active members in a movement.\n\"You have to give them opportunities to help out in other ways,\" says Elana Levin, the director of trainings at Netroots Nation -- an annual-multi issue progressive conference. \"Are you directing people to join conference calls, to do planning and strategy? Are you going to help people build campaigns where they live? You have to use it for something and don't just rely for people to just do it for themselves.\"\nWhite House responds to 'Making a Murderer' petition\nPerhaps one of the best examples comes from Color of Change, the country's largest online racial justice organization, whose campaigns often include petitions paired with calls to action. Among its recent victories, the organization lists its work to end money bail, pressuring Facebook to disallow white nationalist content and pushing GoFundMe to take down a page gathering donations for the men who killed Georgia jogger Ahmaud Arbery.\nAnother recent online petition started by an organization member called on Zoom to protect its users from racist cyber attacks. More than 35,000 people signed. The campaign was then backed by organizations including the National Hispanic Media Coalition, Media Matters for America and the National LGBTQ Task Force. Color of Change said it reached out to Zoom's CEO and then announced the company had hired its first Chief Diversity Officer.\nSo just think of petitions as a first step. They work best when they work in tandem with other efforts -- calls to a mayor's office, city council testimonies, petition deliveries, social media movements.\nAnother example is a petition for Ryan Andresen, who said he was told by his Boy Scout troop in the San Francisco Bay area in 2012 he couldn't receive the Eagle Scout award because he was gay. The petition was one of several initiatives pushing for a change in the organization's policy, that together gathered hundreds of thousands of supporters and mass media attention and put pressure on companies that gave money to the organization.\nIn 2013, the Boy Scouts of America voted to end its ban on openly gay youth -- and two years after that, announced it would allow gay adults as Scout leaders.\n10 petitions that made the biggest impact this decade\nIn the case of Boy Scouts, many of those who signed online petitions later went on to continue efforts to get rid of the ban, says Michael Jones, the managing director of campaigns at Change.org.\n\"Once someone signed a petition, then they got engaged to make phone calls. They got engaged to tag the Boy Scouts of America on social media. They got engaged in calling different decision makers to try and put pressure. They were asked to show up to public events where there were going to be deliveries. They were even asked to start their own petitions focused on local scout councils, encouraging them to support overturning the ban.\"\nThe petitions are just a part of the puzzle, meant to be easy enough to encourage those who sign to get further involved.\nThey should have a 'theory of change'\nWithout clear next steps, petitions can sometimes lead nowhere. In other cases, they've acted as crucial parts of campaigns, working to raise awareness about an issue or an organization and paired with a strong call to action -- or a theory of change.\nOne million sign petition to oust judge in Brock Turner case. Will it matter?\n\"That explains how signing your name to this petition will result in the change that you're calling for,\" Levin says. \"You can't just have people sign their name and then not really do anything with it ... You have to have petitions where you're asking an audience of people to do something in which them exerting mass pressure on the target will matter.\"\nIn other words, having a realistic ask that helps signers understand how adding their name to a cause can help bring about change. For this part, specificity is key -- who's in charge of decisions? What exactly are you calling for? Who's affected?\nVoters oust judge who gave Brock Turner 6 months for sex assault\n\"Let's say you start a petition to influence a local dress code policy for the school that you're in,\" Jones, with Change.org, says.\n\"If you target your local school board and you talk about how the school board has been influenced by other public pressure campaigns or how the school board has made changes before and you really show that pressure can work to influence a policy, that's where you can really make it seem like 'Oh, this is not only something that's timely, topical and has a good story, but actually, I believe it. I believe that if enough people take action, there'll be a chance that we can change something.'\"\nTips for a successful petition\nThe school board example is an important one because not all petitions are part of a larger movement or hosted by organizations who are gathering people power. Oftentimes, it's just one person asking for help. Demanding change in their city or neighborhood. Or just simply working to raise awareness on an issue.\nAnd in that case, there are some key factors that help make campaigns more effective than others.\nJones says one big component is the story -- the emotional stakes -- behind a petition.\nAmerica needs white people to step up\n\"How do you make people care about this? What is the thing that's going to make them see the power of your story or the inspiring piece of your story?\" he said. \"It's really crafting a narrative and talking about how an issue has either affected you or affected your community.\"\nClark-Parsons says petitions are also especially powerful when attached to an issue that's already making headlines. Adding timeliness and urgency to a petition can more easily convey to readers why their signature matters right now.\n\"When people read news that upsets them, they want to do something about it,\" she said. \"A petition provides an easy outlet for taking action.\"\nSo after you jot your name down, take a moment to think about all the actions you could take to build on your signature.\n\"If you don't have time to become actively involved, you might consider donating money to the cause or using your social media networks to signal boost its message,\" Clark-Parsons says. \"Know that all of these small actions can add up.\""}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/05/us/cahoots-replace-police-mental-health-trnd/index.html", "headline": "This town of 170,000 replaced some cops with medics and mental health workers. It's worked for over 30 years", "published_date": "2020-07-05", "text": "(CNN)Around 30 years ago, a town in Oregon retrofitted an old van, staffed it with young medics and mental health counselors and sent them out to respond to the kinds of 911 calls that wouldn't necessarily require police intervention.\nIn the town of 172,000, they were the first responders for mental health crises, homelessness, substance abuse, threats of suicide -- the problems for which there are no easy fixes. The problems that, in the hands of police, have often turned violent.\nToday, the program, called CAHOOTS, has three vans, more than double the number of staffers and the attention of a country in crisis.\nCAHOOTS is already doing what police reform advocates say is necessary to fundamentally change the US criminal justice system -- pass off some responsibilities to unarmed civilians.\nCities much larger and more diverse than Eugene have asked CAHOOTS staff to help them build their own version of the program. CAHOOTS wouldn't work everywhere, at least not in the form it exists in in Eugene.\nBut it's a template for what it's like to live in a city with limited police.\nIt's centered around a holistic approach\nNurse Celene Eldrich, a volunteer nurse for CAHOOTS, waits to screen guests for health concerns at the Egan Warming Center's Springfield location in March.\nCAHOOTS comes from White Bird Clinic, a social services center that's operated in Eugene since the late 1960s. It was the brainchild of some counterculture activists who'd felt the hole where a community health center should be. And in 1989, after 20 years of earning the community's trust, CAHOOTS was created.\nIt stands for Crisis Assistance Helping Out on the Streets and cheekily refers to the relationship between the community health center that started it and the Eugene Police Department.\nMost of the clients White Bird assisted -- unsheltered people or those with mental health issues -- didn't respond well to police. And for the many more people they hadn't yet helped, they wanted to make their services mobile, said David Zeiss, the program's co-founder.\n\"We knew that we were good at it,\" he said. \"And we knew it was something of value to a lot of people ... we needed to be known and used by other agencies that commonly encounter crisis situation.\"\nIt works this way: 911 dispatchers filter calls they receive -- if they're violent or criminal, they're sent to police. If they're within CAHOOTS' purview, the van-bound staff will take the call. They prep what equipment they'll need, drive to the scene and go from there.\nThe program started small, with a van Zeiss called a \"junker,\" some passionate paraprofessionals and just enough funding to staff CAHOOTS 40 hours a week.\nIt always paired one medic, usually a nurse or EMT, with a crisis responder trained in behavioral health. That holistic approach is core to its model.\nPer self-reported data, CAHOOTS workers responded to 24,000 calls in 2019 -- about 20% of total dispatches. About 150 of those required police backup.\nCAHOOTS says the program saves the city about $8.5 million in public safety costs every year, plus another $14 million in ambulance trips and ER costs.\nIt had to overcome mutual mistrust with police\nWhite Bird's counterculture roots ran deep -- the clinic used to fundraise at Grateful Dead concerts in the West, where volunteer medics would treat Deadheads -- so the pairing between police and the clinic wasn't an immediately fruitful one.\nThere was \"mutual mistrust\" between them, said Zeiss, who retired in 2014.\n\"It's true there was a tendency to be mistrustful of the police in our agency and our culture,\" he said. \"It was an obstacle we had to overcome.\"\nAnd for the most part, both groups have: Eugene Police Chief Chris Skinner called theirs a \"symbiotic relationship\" that better serves some residents of Eugene.\n\"When they show up, they have better success than police officers do,\" he said. \"We're wearing a uniform, a gun, a badge -- it feels very demonstrative for someone in crisis.\"\nIt seeks to overturn a disturbing statistic\nAnd there's a great deal of people in Eugene in crisis.\nLane County, which encompasses Eugene and neighbor city Springfield, has staggering rates of homelessness.\nThe county's per-capita homeless rate is among the nation's highest. Recent data from the county also suggests mental health crises are widespread, too -- the suicide rate, at around 17 deaths per 100,000, is about 40% higher than the national average.\nPolice encounters with the homeless often end in citations or arrests. Of homeless people with mental health conditions, anywhere from 62.0% to 90% of them will be arrested, per one journal review of homelessness studies. They may end up in jail, not in treatment or housing, and thus begins the cycle of incarceration that doesn't benefit either party.\nAround 25% of people killed by police show signs of mental illness, according to one study\nCAHOOTS was created in part because of another disturbing statistic -- around 25% of people killed by police show signs of mental illness, according to a journal review of the Washington Post's extensive officer-involved shootings database.\nThe Eugene Police Department has been criticized in years past for shooting and killing people with mental illnesses. Most recently, in February, the city won a wrongful death lawsuit brought by the family of a man who was shot by police. His loved ones said he was a veteran with PTSD who'd threatened suicide. (Skinner was appointed chief in 2018, three years after the shooting.)\nI believe it's time for law enforcement to quit being a catch-base for everything our community and society needs.\nEugene Police Chief Chris Skinner\nMost of CAHOOTS' clients are homeless, and just under a third of them have severe mental illnesses. It's a weight off the shoulders of police, Skinner said.\n\"I believe it's time for law enforcement to quit being a catch-base for everything our community and society needs,\" Skinner said. \"We need to get law enforcement professionals back to doing the core mission of protecting communities and enforcing the law, and then match resources with other services like behavioral health -- all those things we tend to lump on the plate of law enforcement.\"\nIts staffers are unarmed\nThere's no such thing as a \"typical\" CAHOOTS shift these days, said Ben Brubaker, who worked as a CAHOOTS crisis worker before assuming the senior role of clinical co-coordinator at White Bird.\nStaffers respond to substance addiction crises, psychotic episodes, homeless residents and threats of suicide. They make house calls to counsel depressed children at their parents' request, and they're contacted by public onlookers when someone isn't in a position to call CAHOOTS themselves.\nUnlike police, CAHOOTS responders can't force anyone to accept their aid, and they can't arrest anyone. They're not armed, and their uniform usually consists of a White Bird T-shirt and jeans -- the goal is that the more \"civilian-like\" they look, the less threatened their clients will feel.\nTheir approach is different, too. They're taught in training to abandon the \"pseudo-professional\" affect that staffers inadvertently take on in talks with clients. And aside from an extensive background in medical care or mental health, all CAHOOTS employees are judged by their \"lived experiences,\" Brubaker said -- people who've dealt with many of the situations CAHOOTS clients find themselves in are better able to empathize and serve those people, he said.\nBuilding that rapport and trust with clients is part and parcel with their clinical work.\n\"That can be tricky,\" Brubaker said. \"We show up in a white van.\"\nThe demand for its services continues to grow\nCahoots crisis councilor Ned White, left, and EMT Rose Fenwick wrap up a day shift with a stop in Eugene in December 2018.\nFor most people they assist, though, that's still preferable to a police cruiser.\nThey can call police or EMS for assistance if the case requires a \"higher level of care\" than CAHOOTS can provide, he said. But much of it they can do on their own. They can transport clients to hospitals, shelters or White Bird Clinic, where they'll have access to medical and dental care and counseling.\nSupport continues to swell -- CAHOOTS receives about $2 million, which Zeiss says is almost three times what its budget was when he retired in 2014. And CAHOOTS a few years ago expanded to serve neighboring Springfield.\nBut the program is still working with just three vans, which are staffed 24/7. The workload can be overwhelming, Brubaker said.\nThe high demand, low capacity model is holding CAHOOTS back, said Ibrahim Coulibaly, a former White Bird volunteer who serves as the president of the Lane County NAACP chapter. Expanding CAHOOTS' services so it had its own campus, too, could improve its reach, he said.\nWith more funding, he said, reallocated from the police budget or another source, the program could respond to even more crises, with even more employees and, hopefully, at least one more van.\nCAHOOTS could use more than another van, though, said June Fothergill, a pastor at a Springfield church who calls CAHOOTS to pick up the homeless people or people with substance use issues that stop by for free meals.\nFothergill said while CAHOOTS does its part well -- providing immediate services to someone in crisis -- there's still a void when it comes to long-term solutions.\n\"You can call someone for the crisis, but what are they supposed to do for it -- where can they take them except for jail?\" she said. \"That doesn't necessarily provide much treatment.\"\nThey're better equipped than police to care for the people she serves, she said. But if there isn't space in affordable housing, Eugene's detoxing center or mental health facilities, those clients will turn into regulars.\n\"They're doing what they can do,\" she said. \"There's wonderful work going on, but it isn't adequate at the moment.\"\nIt says a partnership with police is essential\nThe idea of \"defunding the police\" crept into the mainstream just one month ago, since the death of George Floyd sparked nationwide protests against racism and police brutality. But what the term means depends on who you ask.\nWhat would the US look like without police? 02:17\nAdvocates for limiting the role of police have pointed to Eugene as an example of social service providers and law enforcement working in harmony.\nBut a growing group of dissenters feel there's little room for police in the movement to fundamentally change the American criminal justice system. Services like CAHOOTS, they say, may function better and more broadly without the assistance of police.\nZeiss isn't sure he agrees.\n\"Partnership with police has always been essential to our model,\" he said. \"A CAHOOTS-like program without a close relationship with police would be very different from anything we've done. I don't have a coherent vision of a society that has no police force.\"\nHe said the current movement has seemingly pitted service providers like CAHOOTS against police, which may stoke suspicion among police over \"whether we're really their allies or their competitors,\" he said.\n\"In some sense, that may be true. But I think we still need to focus on being part of a system, and a system that includes police for some functions,\" Zeiss said.\nPartnership with police has always been essential to our model. I don't have a coherent vision of a society that has no police force.\nDavid Zeiss, the program's co-founder\nSkinner, the Eugene police chief, said reallocating funds from Eugene police would stifle the department, which is already money-tight, and its ability to do the work to defend CAHOOTS when situations turn violent.\n\"Anytime you're thinking about what meaningful change looks like, especially that's sustainable, it takes a significant amount of engagement from stakeholders,\" he said. \"While I totally understand people's desire to do something very, very quickly, we kind of need to keep our eyes on the prize here. If we want to reform police, we have to do it methodically and strategically.\"\nIt's become central in the 'defund the police' debate\nCoulibaly said community leaders are in talks over what to do about police -- should their funding go to CAHOOTS, or should more funding be directed toward better educating police about deescalation techniques? They haven't reached a consensus, he said.\n\"If the city doesn't have enough money to fund CAHOOTS, probably they should think about reallocating some of the funds that go to police to support CAHOOTS,\" he said.\nBrubaker said the relationship with police remains strong, but CAHOOTS is evaluating the calls for change from the public, who've directed their support toward the program. He said staff are figuring out what shape the program will take going forward, but there's no clear path.\n\"We're not trying to be the face of a mainstream institution,\" he said. \"We're just people serving people.\"\nOther cities are trying to develop a similar model\nThe idea of a separate entity in charge of alternative care is more enticing than ever as cities mull over the efficacy of their police departments.\nCAHOOTS has met the moment. Brubaker said he's consulting with cities on how to implement their own CAHOOTS-inspired program, subbing White Bird Clinic for a local organization that serves a similar role.\nThere are a few criteria, though, that Brubaker considers immutable: The CAHOOTS stand-in should be operated by a local non-profit separate from the government that already has an established, positive rapport with the community, and it should ideally be staffed by people who reflect the diversity of that community.\nCAHOOTS consulted Olympia, Washington, on the creation of its own Crisis Response Unit, which is staffed by two social workers. Denver is piloting a program, also inspired by CAHOOTS, led by a local social justice organization.\n... but there is no one-size-fits-all solution\nWhite Bird Clinic and CAHOOTS coordinators can't go into other communities and set up copies of CAHOOTS. What works in Eugene wouldn't work in New York, or in Miami, or in larger cities more diverse than Eugene (less than 2% of the population is Black, according to census data).\nBrubaker knows that a \"fill-in-the-blank\" style of reform wouldn't work. But CAHOOTS does provide a template.\n\"I guess the role that I see for our agency isn't to go in and tell other communities what they need to do and should be doing,\" he said. \"Our role is to assist those communities to have a conversation with each other about what they need and what that response can look like.\"\nIt's not an immediate fix. Zeiss said it took a lot of \"patient plotting\" for CAHOOTS to really have an impact.\n\"At this point, we've patiently waited out an entire generation of police officers,\" he said. \"There's nobody on the Eugene police force today who can remember being a Eugene police officer without CAHOOTS. It's been that slow of a process.\"\nThat doesn't mean other cities shouldn't try.\n\"You have to start,\" he said. \"You can start immediately by creating something and expand it as confidence in it grows.\"\nAnother city's CAHOOTS may not be called CAHOOTS at all, though it'll probably use another cutesy acronym. It's not likely to satisfy advocates who want to defund the police entirely. But, if done right, it could change the lives of some of a city's most vulnerable people."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/23/us/breonna-taylor-police-shooting-invs/index.html", "headline": "A key miscalculation by officers contributed to the tragic death of Breonna Taylor", "published_date": "2020-07-23", "text": "(CNN)In the early morning hours of March 13, police in Louisville, Kentucky, arrested a suspected crack cocaine dealer by the name of Jamarcus Glover.\nGlover was no kingpin. His arrest would not have made national headlines. But having him in handcuffs represented a key moment in a monthslong narcotics probe. Had it ended there it would have been a good night for the police.\nBut in a related, near-simultaneous operation across town, officers wearing tactical vests set up outside an apartment on Louisville's South End with a green door bearing a gold No. 4. It was the home of a young woman detectives suspected was tied to Glover's alleged ring.\nHer name: Breonna Taylor.\nOfficers used a battering ram to break down Taylor's door, triggering a chain of events that would leave the unarmed 26-year-old woman fatally shot in a barrage of seemingly out-of-control police gunfire.\nLawsuit claims Breonna Taylor lived for '5 to 6 minutes' after being shot\nUnlike the recent controversial killings of George Floyd and Rayshard Brooks, there is no police body camera video of what transpired in the moments after officers bashed through Taylor's door. And in an era of widespread demand for greater police accountability, it's a case in which achieving a widely agreed upon sense of justice could prove elusive.\nIn the absence of videotape evidence, the circumstances surrounding Taylor's slaying have been widely discussed \u2014 and sometimes distorted \u2014 on social media and by pundits. Among the false claims is that police were conducting a raid at the wrong address, and that an officer injured in the shooting was a victim of \"friendly fire\" by fellow cops.\nMisconceptions aside, the police operation that night was tragically flawed.\nA CNN review of the incident found that a key miscalculation by police who assumed Taylor was home alone when she was in fact accompanied by a boyfriend who was legally armed, coupled with the decision to press forward with a high-risk, forced entry under questionable circumstances, contributed to the deadly outcome. This story is based on a review of search warrant affidavits, audio recordings of the official statements of key participants, 911 recordings and interviews with more than a dozen people.\nThe chaotic scene that night was exacerbated by an officer accused by his own department of \"blindly\" firing 10 rounds into Taylor's apartment from an outdoor patio. He's since been fired and is appealing his termination.\nA photo from the scene of Breonna Taylor's death provided by Sam Aguiar, the attorney of Breonna Taylor's family\nPolice officials and prosecutors declined comment for this report, citing an ongoing investigation. Attempts to reach Glover, who faces drug trafficking charges stemming from the incident, were unsuccessful. His attorney said his client intends to plead not guilty but declined further comment.\nWalter Katz, a veteran police oversight expert who has monitored departments in Los Angeles, San Jose and Chicago, called the known circumstances surrounding Taylor's death \"very problematic,\" and indicative of systemic flaws in training and tactics.\nThe investigation, which now includes the state attorney general's office and the FBI, is being closely watched not just in Kentucky, but across the US.\nFive warrants approved\nAround noon on March 12, a Louisville police detective presented Jefferson County Circuit Court Judge Mary Shaw with a stack of five search warrant applications for her approval, according to court records.\nDo you have a tip or sensitive material to share with CNN?\nWe offer several ways to reach our journalists securely.\nThey were for locations linked to Glover, a convicted felon suspected of supplying a local drug house. One of the places to be searched was Taylor's apartment.\nPolice said Glover used Taylor's residence as his \"current home address\" as of a February 20 check of various online computer databases and had been receiving mail there, a three-page affidavit for a search warrant written by Detective Joshua C. Jaynes states. The detective said he saw Glover \"walk directly\" into Taylor's apartment in mid-January and leave a short time later with a package. He then drove straight to a \"known drug house,\" Jaynes stated. Taylor's car, the detective noted, had been seen parked outside another alleged drug house linked to Glover \"on different occasions.\" The affidavit did not document any activity regarding Taylor or her residence in March.\nBreonna Taylor death: Detective who applied for warrant put on administrative reassignment\nBesides seeking approval for the searches, police wanted the judge to give them permission to execute the warrants without having to knock on the door, meaning officers could force entry if they saw fit. Such extreme tactics are supposed to be reserved for cases in which police fear suspects may try to arm themselves or are considered likely to destroy evidence if given the opportunity in the moments before a raid. Serving so-called \"no-knock\" warrants is considered among the most dangerous work in law enforcement. Police are supposed to precisely articulate for judges why such actions are needed in a given case.\nFor each of his five warrants, Jaynes used identical language seeking to justify the no-knock entry: \"These drug traffickers have a history of attempting to destroy evidence, have cameras on the location that compromise Detectives once an approach to the dwelling is made, and have a history of fleeing from law enforcement.\"\nThe judge approved all the searches and gave the police permission to force entry into the locations if needed.\nIn a written statement provided to CNN, Judge Shaw declined to discuss the details of the warrant, saying she was \"restrained in my ability to comment on ongoing legal matters.\" But, she said, she took more than 30 minutes to review and consider the warrant applications and \"made the probable cause determination required of me by law.\"\nShaw added that Taylor's death was a tragedy that \"will stay with me forever.\"\nLawyers for Taylor's family would later attack Jaynes' affidavit for Taylor's residence as weak and misleading. For example, any mail Glover may have received at her apartment would have been innocuous items such as clothes or shoes, one of the attorneys told CNN.\n\"It definitely wasn't drugs.\"\n'We kept banging'\nHours after Shaw signed the warrants, police began the operation, conducting near-simultaneous raids at the various locations.\nTaylor's apartment, according to police, was considered a less volatile, \"soft target.\" As such, police commanders decided in advance to have officers knock and announce their presence before entry. That decision was communicated in a pre-operational briefing, according to a source familiar with the details of the operation who requested anonymity due to the ongoing investigation.\nThere's a renewed call for police body cameras. Here's why that may not be the right solution\nSometime after 12:30 a.m., Sgt. Jonathan Mattingly began pounding on the door. He later told investigators he believed Taylor was alone and he wanted to give her sufficient time to answer.\nAs officers waited for a response, a neighbor poked his head out to ask what was going on. One of the officers, Brett Hankison, extended his gun and told the neighbor to get back inside his apartment, Mattingly would later tell investigators.\n\"Brett was a little bit worked up,\" Mattingly said. \"I remember looking at Brett, saying, 'Brett, relax. Brett, just relax. Relax.\"\nWhen there was no answer after repeated knocks, Mattingly said, he announced he was a police officer there to serve a search warrant.\n\"Police. Come to the door,\" he said.\nAnother officer on the search team said he heard movement inside and thought someone was about to answer the door.\n\"We kept banging and announcing,\" Mattingly said, but still no one answered.\nEventually, a lieutenant at the scene gave the order to \"go ahead and hit\" the door with the battering ram, Mattingly said.\n'Who is it?'\nTaylor had been watching a movie in bed together with her boyfriend Kenneth Walker when she drifted off to sleep beside him. Walker told investigators he heard banging at the door after midnight and his first thought was that it was Glover. He said he knew Taylor had dated the accused drug dealer during their on-and-off seven-year relationship. He was concerned there might be trouble.\nTaylor, who had awoken, shouted, \"Who is it\"?\nWalker said there was no response.\nHe said he and Taylor scrambled to get dressed and that he grabbed his gun, which his attorney said he legally owns.\nThe pounding at the door continued, he said.\n\"She's yelling at the top of her lungs \u2014 and I am too at this point \u2014 who is it?\" he recalled. \"No answer. No response. No anything.\"\nAs they made their way down a hallway toward the front door, Walker said, the door flew off its hinges.\n\"So I just let off one shot,\" he said. \"I still can't see who it is or anything.\"\nFollowing orders and police procedure\nMattingly was first through the door.\nHe could make out a man and a woman in the darkened hallway, he said, and the man had a gun in his hand.\n\"I remember seeing the barrel,\" Mattingly said.\nThen, in an instant, he saw the flash of the muzzle and felt the heat of a bullet in his leg. The round had severed his femoral artery.\nMattingly returned fire, squeezing off multiple shots in rapid succession.\n\"Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom,\" he recalled. In all, he said he fired six times.\nHe remembered falling to the ground and being helped to safety outside the apartment before hearing fellow officers return fire.\nHankison and Officer Myles Cosgrove were later identified as the other officers who discharged their weapons that evening.\nAn attorney for Cosgrove declined comment. Hankison's attorney did not respond to calls and emails from CNN. Mattingly's attorney, Todd McMurtry, defended his client's conduct.\n\"Sgt. Mattingly was following orders of superior officers, was not involved in the planning process of the arrest, and at all times followed established police procedures,\" he said.\nNone of the officers has been charged with a crime.\nLouisville police officers Myles Cosgrove, Brett Hankison and Jonathan Mattingly. Hankison was fired by Louisville's police chief for his role in the shooting.\n'Help'\nInside the apartment, Walker was unharmed. But Taylor lay on the ground beside him, bleeding profusely. There were bullet holes everywhere, including in a neighboring apartment where a young child lived.\nWalker punched 911 into his cell phone.\nHis voice sounds distraught as he tells the dispatcher someone had kicked in the door and shot his girlfriend.\nAs the operator peppered him with questions, Walker repeatedly moaned his girlfriend's nickname \u2014 \"Bre\" \u2014 and the word \"help.\"\nIn the minutes after the shooting, Louisville police swarmed the parking lot of Taylor's apartment complex.\nCell phone video shot by a neighbor and posted on social media by Taylor's sister captured the scene:\nOfficers with guns drawn shout commands from behind squad cars, as Walker walks backwards out of the complex with his hands in the air.\nA photo from the scene of Breonna Taylor's death provided by Sam Aguiar, the attorney of Breonna Taylor's family\nHe was taken away in handcuffs. Six days later, a grand jury indicted him of attempted murder of a police officer.\nThe indictment was returned following a brief presentation in which members of the panel were essentially told only that Walker had opened fire on the police during a raid and that one of the officers had been hit.\nGrand jurors were not told that Walker said he was unaware the people who broke through Taylor's door were police and that he believed he was acting in self-defense. Nor was the panel told of Taylor's death.\nNo drugs were found in the apartment\nIn May, Walker's defense attorney, Rob Eggert, filed a motion to have the indictment dismissed.\nHe said the prosecution's presentation to the panel \"completely mischaracterizes\" what took place on the night Taylor was killed and that the grand jury was \"woefully misled.\"\n\"Their way out of this was to bury my guy,\" Eggert told CNN in a recent interview. \"And that's not right.\"\nA day later, in a surprise move, the Louisville area's top local prosecutor agreed to have the indictment against Walker dismissed. Thomas Wine, the Commonwealth's Attorney for Jefferson County, said he disagreed that grand jurors had been misled, but agreed that it was important for them to hear from Walker directly before deciding whether to indict. If, after further investigation, the case was brought back to the grand jury, Wine said, Walker would be given that opportunity.\n'A shock to the conscience'\nTaylor's shooting was well covered by the Louisville Courier Journal in the days and weeks after it occurred. But the case received comparatively little national exposure.\nThat changed following the May 25 police slaying of Floyd in Minneapolis, Minneapolis, that sparked weeks of protests in cities around the country.\nTaylor's case exploded into the national consciousness alongside Floyd's.\nLast month, the Louisville city council passed Breonna's Law, which banned no-knock warrants and requires officers serving search warrants to wear body cameras.\nEight days later, Louisville's newly appointed police chief gave Hankison a termination letter.\nThe FBI has opened an investigation into the shooting death of Kentucky EMT Breonna Taylor\nThe chief accused Hankison of blindly firing 10 rounds into Taylor's apartment through a covered patio door and window that prevented him from assessing any threat posed by the occupants before opening fire.\nSome of his rounds penetrated a neighboring apartment and endangered the lives of three of its occupants, the letter stated.\n\"I find your conduct a shock to the conscience,\" the chief wrote. \"Your actions have brought discredit upon yourself and the Department ... and demands your termination.\"\nThe department's Public Integrity Unit has completed a formal investigation into the shooting, but the results of the probe have not been publicly released.\nMeanwhile, FBI agents have taken documents from Louisville police investigators, according to a source familiar with the matter. At Taylor's apartment complex, agents have been interviewing her former neighbors, one resident told CNN.\nKatz, the police oversight expert, said he believes there has been mounting pressure on prosecutors across the country to stop giving undue deference to the police version of events in controversial uses of force.\nBut a case like Taylor's, which has no video, demands a methodical, painstaking investigation that could take significant time to complete, he said.\nOne key area of dispute in the case is whether police announced their presence before breaking down the door.\nMattingly told investigators he and others did so repeatedly. Walker said he never heard anyone say \"police\" and that his and Taylor's shouts of \"who is it?\" were met with silence.\nCNN interviewed several of Taylor's neighbors, either directly or through their attorney. Most said they were awakened by the gunfire and therefore did not hear what preceded it.\n'Truly, definitely missed'\nTaylor's aunt, Bianca Austin, and Taylor's sister, Ju'Niyah Palmer, say they want the police officers involved in her death to be charged with murder.\nIn a recent interview in a park overlooking downtown Louisville, Taylor's sister and aunt spoke about the circumstances surrounding her slaying, and what they hope will come of her death.\nHer aunt, Bianca Austin, described Taylor as a \"spunky, goofy little kid\" who blossomed into a hard-working, goal-oriented young woman who placed an emphasis on family. At the time of her death, she had been working as a certified emergency medical technician.\n\"She just was a fun person to be around,\" Austin said. \"She's going to be truly, definitely be missed.\"\nThe loss has been so devastating on Taylor's mother that she spent this past Mother's Day in her room, refusing to get out of bed.\nTaylor's sister, Ju'Niyah Palmer, who was also her roommate and best friend, acknowledged that Taylor had a past relationship with Glover. But she said her sister wasn't involved in Glover's alleged drug operation and had forbade him from bringing that aspect of his life into her personal life.\n\"You cannot come up in my house with any drugs,\" she quoted her sister as telling Glover. \"My sister live(s) here and I can't jeopardize her getting hurt because of what you do.\"\nShe said Taylor had nothing to hide in her apartment and would have been happy to prove that to the police if she'd known it was them at the door.\n\"If they were to come in and say, 'Hey, you sell drugs', she'd be like ... that's not who I am,\" Palmer said.\nBoth women faulted the police for Taylor's killing and said the officers involved should be charged with murder.\n\"We're going to fight this to the end,\" her aunt said. \"This is our baby and she's going to get the justice she deserves.\""}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/27/us/big-city-police-department-budgets/index.html", "headline": "As US cities cut police budgets, the nation's largest force faces financial reckoning", "published_date": "2020-06-27", "text": "New York (CNN)At a time of intense scrutiny of law enforcement since George Floyd's death, a movement to slash police department budgets nationwide is gaining momentum in the midst of police reform efforts and an uptick in violent crime in some major cities.\nThe New York Police Department, the nation's largest police force, faces its financial reckoning this week, with its 2021 budget due before Tuesday.\nAround the country, from Los Angeles to Seattle to Minneapolis to Philadelphia, city officials are mulling cuts that scale back the number of officers to shift money toward social services.\nEconomic woes from coronavirus lockdowns have left city budgets strapped for revenue and decision makers looking for places to trim, even as crime rates spike.\n\"Conventional budget politics was always about, if you have to make budget cuts, everything should be on the table \u2014 but not the police department. Somehow the notion was that if you cut a police budget, you were soft on crime,\" said New York City's Comptroller, Scott Stringer, who submitted a proposal for reducing the police department budget but is not involved in passing it. \"Now, people want a different kind of budgeting and a different kind of governing.\"\nCalls are growing to defund police in the US. Here are some lessons from overseas\nMaria Haberfeld, a professor of police science at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, said nearly 90% of police department budgets go to paying personnel, including salaries and overtime. The rest of the money covers other expenses such as equipment and training.\nDrastic budget cuts would affect every facet of policing in America, Haberfeld said.\n\"With crime increasing you cannot afford to dilute the deployment,\" she said. \"There'll be cuts to overtime. Investigations will suffer. Response times will suffer \u2014 everything we ask the police to improve in terms of response time, in terms of clearing investigations and finding people responsible for various crimes.\"\nAlex Vitale, coordinator of the Policing and Social Justice Project at Brooklyn College and author of \"The End of Policing,\" said the calls for change stem from decades of \"gross over reliance on policing\" in the country.\n\"This is really a reaction to 40 years of American politicians turning every social problem under the sun, especially in low income and communities of color, over to the police to manage,\" he told CNN. \"And people are demanding that we find better solutions.\"\nThere are calls for $1 billion NYPD budget cut\nThe case for defunding the police 18:21\nAs protesters cried out to \"defund the NYPD\" while marching through the city's streets, advocates and city leaders considered which parts of the department's nearly $6 billion budget could go.\n\"The NYPD budget is incredibly opaque. It's the most secretive budget in the entire city,\" said Joo-Hyun Kang, director of Communities United for Police Reform, an advocacy group that proposed a $1 billion cut from NYPD's budget for the 2021 fiscal year.\nWhen it comes to policing the police, strong watchdogs are the exception\nOne of the most draconian measures proposed by the group is a hiring freeze, which would save $263 million in fiscal year 2021, according to the plan. It would also reduce the number of uniformed officers by taking officers out of schools, firing about 220 officers who are on modified duty and accused of misconduct, and removing officers from \"non-police\" enforcement roles including homeless outreach, mental health response and transportation.\n\"Cutting at least a billion dollars from the NYPD is the floor not the ceiling of what should be done,\" Kang said. \"NYPD's budget has been allowed to balloon and has been politically protected for years ...\"\nIn a statement, the NYPD cautioned there will be consequences of such a hit to its budget.\n\"Depleting NYPD personnel by several thousand police officers, at a time of increasing violence, would harm New Yorkers \u2014 particularly the communities most in need of public safety. While we support the shifting of some services to other city agencies to achieve the kind of real savings that are necessary now, significant budget cuts threaten to erode our shared successes, our continued reforms and the quality of service New Yorkers expect and deserve.\"\nThere's a growing call to defund the police. Here's what it means\nStringer, whose office focuses on city spending and how to make it run more efficiently, has a more modest proposal that would still cut $265 million from NYPD's budget each year over the next four years, for a total of nearly $1.1 billion.\nThe biggest cuts under Stringer's proposal would be to the department's 36,000 uniformed officers. He suggests cutting through an estimated 3% attrition rate. Those cuts, plus other \"fringe savings,\" would save the city $223 million for the year.\n\"Defund is not just about taking money from one agency to another. Defund is also about investment to fight systemic racism,\" Stringer said. \"A budget is as much a moral document as a financial one. It lays out the aspirations of a city. You put a price tag on those aspirations. I would like money directed at communities that need it the most.\"\nA push is on to fund youth and social services\nNYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea told CNN earlier this month he views shifting police funds to help youths as separate from the \"defund\" movement.\nNYPD commissioner testifies in ongoing investigation into interactions between police and the public\n\"Look at the fiscal crisis that we're about to be met by -- everyone is going to have to tighten their belts, including the NYPD,\" Shea said. \"I absolutely do commit to taking some money out of the NYPD budget if it can be used to restore programs for kids. I think that's crime fighting. I think it's crime fighting in a different way.\"\nNew York City is already struggling financially because of tax revenue shortfalls due to the pandemic.\nCrime rates, meanwhile, have spiked.\nNYPD statistics show the city's murder rate is up over 18%, over the first five months of the year compared to last year. Overall, shooting incidents are also up over 18% for the year as compared to last year, statistics show.\n\"It's a combination of things,\" said NYPD Chief of Department Terrance Monahan in an exclusive interview with CNN. \"More people not in jail. Rikers Island (jail) in New York is empty. Between Covid, between bail reform, the protest caused animosity towards the police, which took us out of neighborhoods that needed us the most.\"\nMayor Bill de Blasio has said he supports cutting money from the NYPD budget to shift toward youth and social services and is in closed-door negotiations with the City Council.\n\"I'm very hopeful that we'll get to a positive outcome with the Council, a major shift of funds from the NYPD to youth services and other community needs,\" de Blasio said on Friday.\nHouse approves police reform bill named in honor of George Floyd\nWhile de Blasio has said he does not support cutting $1 billion from the police budget, New York City Council Speaker Corey Johnson said Thursday the council is pushing the mayor to consider slashing more. He and other council members called for $1 billion in cuts to the NYPD's budget for next year.\n\"We have been negotiating, we have been pushing, we have been prodding, we have been telling them every single day that the number needs to be a bigger number,\" Johnson said.\nThe speaker said he was \"incredibly concerned\" about increasing crime rates.\n\"And we want to make sure that we are effectively dealing with those issues, but we don't think that the traditional methods of policing are the only things that work,\" Johnson said.\nPolice advocates argue that cutting uniformed officers at a time of spiking crime rates is a recipe for disaster.\nPolice Benevolent Association President Pat Lynch said, for decades, city agencies that failed at their tasks had those jobs taken away and given to the police.\n\"If the City Council wants to give responsibilities back to those failing agencies, that's their choice,\" Lynch said in a June 12 statement. \"But they will bear the blame for every new victim, for every New Yorker in need of help who falls through the cracks. They won't be able to throw cops under the bus anymore.\"\nThe NYPD said 272 uniformed officers have filed for retirement between May 25 and June 23 \u2014 which Lynch attributed to cops being at their \"breaking point.\" Last year, 183 officers had filed for retirement during that period.\n\"We are all asking the same question: How can we keep doing our job in this environment?\" he said in a statement.\nMinneapolis has been the most aggressive\nMinneapolis has taken the most dramatic steps, essentially declaring its police department beyond reform.\nThe City Council on Friday officially moved to dismantle its police force and replace it with a department of community safety and violence prevention in the wake of the police killing of Floyd in that city.\nFour weeks after George Floyd's death, an embattled police union finally speaks out\nThe unanimous vote approving a proposed charter amendment represents a first step in a complicated process that includes a review by a public commission before the measure could ultimately end up in the hands of voters at the November ballot.\nThe proposed change to the charter also faces a review by a council policy and oversight committee next month. The charter commission has at least 60 days to review and make a recommendation to the council.\nThe statutory deadline for submitting questions on the November 3 ballot is August 21, giving voters a final say on the matter.\nNine members of the city council \u2014 a veto-proof majority \u2014 pledged on June 7 to dismantle the police department.\nMinneapolis City Council takes another step to 'end the current policing system'\nEarlier this month, 12 city council members unanimously approved a resolution to declare the intent to create a \"transformative new model\" of policing, setting off a yearlong process to envision and create a new way to keep people safe.\nPolice Chief Medaria Arradondo has pushed reforms and withdrawn from contract negotiations with the police union in an attempt to facilitate change. He has cautioned that conversations about defunding or dismantling the department \"have to be thoughtful, they have to be mindful, they have to be based in fact.\"\n\"If it's totally driven by emotion, lives could be at stake as well,\" he said.\nThe city has experienced a recent spike in crime, including the shootings of 12 people \u2014 one fatally \u2014 last weekend.\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey also has said he does not support abolishing or defunding the department, preferring instead what he calls \"massive structural reforms\" in policing.\nPolice budgets are cut in LA, Philly, Seattle\nIn Los Angeles, Mayor Eric Garcetti has agreed to slash between $100 million and $150 million in proposed LAPD funding after Californians decried a proposal to increase its budget to $1.86 billion.\nThe aim, the city said, is to \"build trust and bolster accountability\" with more transparent police practices.\nThe People's Budget LA Coalition called Garcetti's pledge \"a start\" but said a $150 million cut for fiscal year 2020-21 would \"still leave LAPD with 51% of the city's unrestricted revenues.\"\nIn another budgetary move, the police department said officers who worked large amounts of overtime during recent protests would be compensated with time off and not paid, according to an internal memo.\nProtests in Los Angeles cost LAPD $40 million in overtime expenses but officers won't be paid\n\"During this extraordinary time, including the full mobilization of our sworn members, the Department has expended more than $40 million dollars in overtime expenses,\" the memo reads. \"This amount far exceeds any budgetary reserve to address unusual occurrences.\"\nLAPD officers say morale is at its lowest points in decades, with young officers angry at their superiors' perceived deference to civilian leadership.\nThe department tweeted earlier this month that between May 31 and June 6 homicides jumped 250% from the previous week. The number of shooting victims increased 56%.\nIn Philadelphia, Mayor Jim Kenney pulled back a planned $19 million increase in the police budget after 14 city council members said in a letter that they would not support it.\nThe cut totals more than $33 million after another $14 million for crossing guards and public safety enforcement officers was diverted to the city managing director's office, CNN affiliate WPVI reported.\nThe police department receives a sixth of the city's annual operating budget, $750 million, according to the letter. Since 2016, the police budget has increased by about $120 million.\n\"Many of us have realized that, as progressive and inclusive as we think we are, we still have a lot to learn,\" Kenney said in a statement announcing the cut along with a series of police reforms.\n\"We now will focus on reconciliation, on understanding, on listening \u2014 and on taking action. We will embark on a path toward real change in Philadelphia, and hopefully across America.\"\nResidents and businesses sue Seattle over protest zone\nSeattle Mayor Jenny Durkan is proposing to slash $20 million to the police department budget for the remainder of 2020 \u2014 as the city grapples with a shortfall of more than $300 million due to the pandemic.\nThe planned construction of a new police precinct has been put on hold.\nDurkan also directed the police department to identify options for other reductions and said the city would consult the community about the 2021 police budget.\n\"Our city and country are at a historic crossroads,\" she said in a statement.\nVitale, the Brooklyn College professor, called the changes to law enforcement funding \"an interrogation of the specific things that police are doing which have caused significant harms, have reproduced race and class inequality in America.\"\n\"It's about communicating with communities about what their needs are that have been ignored by government for generations now and demanding that they no longer turn those things over to folks whose tools for solving their problems are guns and handcuffs, coercion and threats,\" he said.\nCNN's Ganesh Setty contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/02/us/police-protests-use-of-force/index.html", "headline": "Protests are erupting over police brutality.

Accusations of heavy-handed police responses have come under withering criticism, with some officers suspended or facing criminal charges.\nIn some cases, police leaders say violence in the streets leaves them with no other choice. But protesters and police critics argue that some officers are escalating tensions with their actions.\n\"They're making the argument for the demonstrators, that American policing remains unreformed and out of control,\" says Alex Vitale, a professor of sociology at Brooklyn College who's called for police funding to be cut.\nIt's a fast-moving situation, with different scenes unfolding in different cities, and even -- at times -- on different blocks. Some officers have garnered praise for showing solidarity with protesters by kneeling beside them, or for defusing tensions by talking face-to-face with demonstrators.\n\"That's what people in the community want.

They want to feel a sense of trust,\" says Cedric Alexander, a CNN law enforcement analyst and former president of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives.\nBut Vitale says some police departments have been sending a much more aggressive message.\nPolice officers clash with protestors near the White House on June 1 as demonstrations against George Floyd's death continue.\n\"I'm surprised at the scale of it, that so many departments across the country are taking this zero-tolerance, quick escalation stance towards the demonstrators,\" he says. \"They very quickly escalated to tear gas and charging crowds. ... They did not go that extra mile to try to keep things from escalating out of control.\"\nHere's a look at some of the forceful ways we've seen officers around the country responding to protests:\nSome are accused of using excessive force\nWhat started as peaceful protests decrying police brutality and systemic racism last week after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis have sometimes turned violent. In some cities, stores have been looted and police have been pelted with rocks and bottles. Hundreds of people have been arrested.\nBut footage from recent protests also has spurred allegations that some officers are using excessive force in their responses to demonstrations.\nTwo officers in Buffalo, New York, were suspended without pay Thursday after video showed them pushing a 75-year-old man, causing him to fall back and hit his head on the sidewalk.\nIn Fort Lauderdale, Florida, a police officer is under investigation for allegedly shoving a black protester who was kneeling during a protest.\nA cop pushed a protester. Then a black officer stepped in 01:19\nAnd in Kansas City, Missouri, a video showing an officer pepper spraying a man during an arrest spurred outrage. \"This man was using his words,\" the poster of the video on Twitter wrote, \"and was responded to with weapons.\" A police spokesman told CNN they're reviewing the incident, and that pepper spray was used because the crowd of protesters was aggressive and violent.\nIn Atlanta, prosecutors say six officers are now facing charges after police were filmed breaking the windows of a vehicle, yanking two protesters out of the car and tasing one of them. Atlanta's mayor said two of the officers were fired after video of the incident showed them using excessive force against the college students.\n'I thought I might be killed' -- college student recalls traumatic encounter with Atlanta police\nIn New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo says he's asked the state's attorney general to investigate after videos surfaced showing what the governor called \"disturbing actions\" by officers during protests.\nFootage from New York showed a police truck plowing into a crowd, an officer brandishing his gun amid protesters and an officer pushing a woman.\n\"I think some of the actions of the NYPD have exacerbated the anger. There are videos of some NYPD actions that are very disturbing,\" Cuomo said in a briefing on Monday. \"There are videos of NYPD cars driving into a crowd that are very disturbing, pulling a mask down off a person to pepper spray them, throwing a woman to the ground, it's on video, it's on video. The looting is on video, so is NYPD activity on video.\"\nVideo appears to show NYPD truck plowing through crowd 01:16\nThe governor's comments drew a swift rebuke from the president of the city's police union, who accused Cuomo of \"wrongly blaming the chaos on the cops.\"\n\"Police officers are being run down, knocked down and almost shot on a nightly basis,\" Police Benevolent Association President Patrick Lynch said in a statement.\nCNN law enforcement analyst James Gagliano, a retired FBI supervisory special agent, said when looking at the video of the NYPD vehicle plowing into protesters, it's important to remember officers have been facing tremendous pressure and physical attacks.\n\"I can't get into the individual cops' minds, except to think that the night before, a Molotov cocktail had been thrown in a police vehicle with four police officers in New York City,\" Gagliano said. \"I'm guessing that they were nervous about what was happening. Things were being thrown at their vehicle. There was no way out. Somebody stepped on the gas. It's unfortunate. It's awful. We don't want to see any harm, anybody hurt, but this right now, this -- it's like a war zone in this country.\"\nSome are firing tear gas\nVideo footage and photos from protests across the country -- from a park outside the White House to the streets of Minneapolis -- show law enforcement firing tear gas into crowds of people. Sometimes the tear gas is being fired in response to violence and looting, and sometimes protesters allege it's being fired without provocation.\nA person holds a \"Black Lives Matter\" sign as as a heavy cloud of tear gas and smoke rises after being deployed by Seattle police on June 1.\n\"In the 1960s and '70s we saw a lot of use of tear gas, and mostly police departments learned a lesson -- that tear gas almost always makes the situation worse,\" Vitale says. \"And now all of a sudden, they're just letting it fly all over the place.\"\nVitale is the coordinator of the Policing and Social Justice Project, which has called for police funding to be cut, arguing that using the money for other programs like increased school counselors and drug treatment would do more to keep residents safe.\nHe says the firing of tear gas is one telling example of the ways police are not only inflaming tensions in the streets, but bolstering the case he and other critics have been making.\n\"This is a gross overreaction,\" he says.\nPolice in Minneapolis, Minnesota, advance on demonstrators who are protesting the killing of George Floyd.\nPolice across the country have defended their decisions to use tear gas.\n\"We applaud those who stand up and protest against police brutality, because we do, too, and we stand with them. But last night, peaceful protests began, but that is not how it ended,\" Dallas Police Chief U. Rene\u00e9 Hall told reporters Saturday after officers deployed tear gas during protests the night before. \"And what I want you to be clear about with me today, so there is no ambiguity, this department will not tolerate rogue vandalism. We will not tolerate tearing up our city. We will not tolerate tearing up our communities and bringing hurt, harm or danger to individuals who are protesting, and definitely not the ones who are protecting the residents of this community.\"\nAccording to the Dallas Morning News, Hall said the decision to use tear gas was made because property was being vandalized, bricks were thrown at officers and tires were slashed on police squad cars.\nMany are wearing riot gear\nBut even when no tasers are drawn and no shots are fired, some say some officers are behaving in a way that spurs more violence rather than calming the situation.\nOne case in point, they say: officers wearing riot gear.\nPolice clash with protesters during a demonstration on June 1, 2020 in Washington, DC.\n\"Equipping officers in a manner more appropriate for a battlefield may put them in the mindset that confrontation and conflict are inevitable,\" said Rachel Ward, National Director of Research at Amnesty International USA, in a statement. \"US police across the country are ... exacerbating a tense situation and endangering the lives of protesters.\"\nVitale told CNN it's easy to see how tensions escalate.\n\"Imagine you're angry and in front of you is a police officer in his regular uniform. Now imagine you're angry, and what's in front of you is a police officer in a helmet and a shield and a military-grade vehicle behind him,\" Vitale says. \"You're much more likely to throw a rock. It just dehumanizes the whole situation.\"\nPolice leaders have cautioned that protective gear is necessary to keep officers and the public safe.\nA police officer aims a nonlethal weapon as protesters raise their hands during demonstrations in Santa Monica, California, on May 31.\nIn Boston, after a city councilor criticized police for wearing what she described as \"riot gear\" to a protest, the police commissioner defended his officers on Twitter.\n\"The officers after being attacked by objects thrown at them by violent protestors, were ordered to put on protective helmets, not riot gear,\" Boston Police Commissioner William Gross wrote. \"The Officers were in uniform not riot gear. Four officers, your constituents, were injured. One hospitalized. Ty (thank you) for caring.\"\nSome are arresting and assaulting journalists\nThrough it all, reports of journalists being arrested and assaulted while covering the protests have also been growing.\nThe U.S. Press Freedom Tracker says it's counted more than 300 \"press freedom violations\" since the start of protests last week. As of Thursday night, the group's records showed \"49+ arrests, 192 assaults (160 by police, 32 by others), 42 equipment/newsroom damage.\"\nSome journalists have also reported being attacked by protesters.\nThis week the American Civil Liberties Union filed a class-action lawsuit asking a Minnesota court to stop what it calls \"unconstitutional conduct targeting journalists\"\n\"The past week has been marked by an extraordinary escalation of unlawful force deliberately targeting reporters,\" the ACLU said in Wednesday's filing.\nA photographer in Minneapolis said she was blinded by a rubber bullet. In Louisville, an officer fired what appeared to be pepper balls at a reporter for local TV station WAVE 3 News. The incident was broadcast live on the air.\nIn some cases, authorities have apologized, like Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz did after CNN's Omar Jimenez and his team were wrongfully arrested in Minneapolis last week.\nMinnesota police arrest CNN team on live television 06:36\n\"We are facing a full-scale assault on the First Amendment freedom of the press,\" Brian Hauss, staff attorney with the ACLU's Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, said in a statement. \"We will not let these official abuses go unanswered. This is the first of many lawsuits the ACLU intends to file across the country. Law enforcement officers who target journalists will be held accountable.\"\nSome may be taking cues from the President\nOn a conference call with governors this week, President Trump urged them to take more aggressive tactics with violent protesters.\n\"You have to dominate, or you'll look like a bunch of jerks,\" Trump said, according to an audio recording of the call obtained by CNN. \"You have to arrest and try people.\"\nTrump tells governors they must 'dominate' protesters 02:54\nThat, Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo said, isn't what law enforcement should be doing.\n\"It's not about dominating,\" Acevedo told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. \"It's about winning hearts and minds.\"\nAcevedo said police need to act swiftly to weed out bad cops, stressing that on a daily basis around the county, most officers are doing the right thing.\n\"When good policing happens, which happens every day in our country, it doesn't make the news. Tens of millions of contacts every year, in very dynamic situations, it doesn't make the news,\" he said. \"We're the most visible cog of government. When we get it wrong, there's no excuse. We can't excuse it. We have to accept it. But don't kid yourself into believing that the rage is just because of what happens with police.\"\nThe day police charged a peaceful protest for Trump's photo-op 02:35\nProtesters, Acevedo said, are outraged over other things, too, like inequalities in healthcare and education.\n\"The reason this stuff happens is because there are too many people right now in this country that are throwing block -- bricks and damaging property, never bother to vote. So, you have a choice,\" he said. \"Lift up your voice. Be heard in the voting booth, and continue to march peacefully, so the focus remains on bad policing, criminal policing.\"\nHours after the Houston police chief spoke with CNN, peaceful protesters just outside the White House gates were dispersed with tear gas, flash grenades and rubber bullets.\nIt was all, apparently, so Trump could visit a nearby church.\nCNN's Brian Stelter, Kristina Sgueglia, Kevin Liptak, Sarah Westwood, Paul LeBlanc and Jay Croft contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/23/us/black-capitalization-school-textbooks-mcgraw-hill-trnd/index.html", "headline": "This one letter in a textbook could change how millions of kids learn about race", "published_date": "2020-07-23", "text": "(CNN)Albert Broussard's intention to capitalize one letter in one word may impact millions of children around the US and how they learn about race.\nBroussard, a longtime history textbook writer for McGraw Hill and a history professor at Texas A&M University, is planning to capitalize the b in Black in a lengthy revision to a history textbook used in American middle and high schools. His revisions are happening as civil unrest grips the nation and while experts argue that change is needed in how Black history is taught in the US.\nWhether to capitalize the b in Black is also part of an ongoing historical debate on racial identification that dates back to sociologist W.E.B.

While it is unclear how many textbooks each company sells each year, more than $209 million worth of K-12 social studies books were sold in the US in 2018, according to data provided to CNN by the Association of American Publishers.\nTaking 'Black Lives Matter' from slogan to reality\nThe Associated Press and New York Times were among numerous publishers of the first drafts of history to capitalize Black recently. CNN made the same decision and will also capitalize White.\nCengage, an education and technology company which has nearly a dozen different K-12 history programs and books in the US, will capitalize Black and White while Houghton Mifflin Harcourt will be capitalizing Black.\n\"Cengage has undertaken a review of our textbooks and learning platforms for both higher ed and K-12 to evaluate our standards and practices. The capitalization of 'Black' and 'White' has been raised for consideration as part of this review, and is being adopted in texts where pertinent to the discussion, including the most recent edition of AP Human Geography,\" the company told CNN in a statement.\nThese decisions have been praised by teachers and education experts alike.\nThe educational habits children develop can make a difference\nA shift from using black to Black in K-12 textbooks is a step in the right direction, said Michael Hines, an assistant professor at Stanford University's Graduate School of Education.\n\"It's a recognition of the significance of the fact that Black people throughout the African diaspora share commonalities of history, culture and identity,\" Hines told CNN over email.\nThis was a sentiment shared by Gerardo Mu\u00f1oz, a social studies teacher who has taught in Denver Public Schools for 21 years. He is a producer and co-host of the podcast \"Too Dope Teachers and a Mic\" which addresses race and education in the US.\n\"It is very important, in my opinion, to use Black instead of black. In a very subtle way, black minimizes the importance of being Black. Because Black Americans were ruthlessly and abruptly cut off from their own national and ethnic identities, they don't have the privilege of attaching a homeland, spiritual or otherwise, to their American identity,\" Mu\u00f1oz told CNN over email.\nThe pandemic is causing an exponential rise in the online exploitation of children, experts say\nMany educators and experts agreed that the use of a capitalized Black in textbooks only works if teachers explain its importance. These sorts of classroom conversations can have a lasting impact on young impressionable minds, said Shawn Matson, a high school history teacher in Madison, Wisconsin.\nNkemka Anyiwo, a developmental psychologist and postdoctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania, has studied how messages youth receive about race affect their development. These messages, also known as \"racial socialization,\" play a significant role in how young people understand themselves, she told CNN through email.\nSchools build the foundation of young people's knowledge and play a crucial role in the racial and sociopolitical socialization of young people, Anyiwo said.\nWhile the longtime use of lowercase black in textbooks may seem minor, \"it can operate as an implicit form of racial messaging that perpetuate Black inferiority,\" she added.\n\"We have to ensure that teachers have the competency to clearly explain the importance of and impetus behind the language transition,\" Anyiwo said. \"Young people may not understand the significance of the transition without explicit conversations with teachers about the historical and political significance of 'Black' as identity and America's historical legacy of using 'black' as a tool to disenfranchise.\"\nThis is not the first time Black people have wanted a letter capitalized\nDu Bois and Edward A. Johnson, the late teacher who was also the first Black member of the New York legislature, fought to change how descendants from Africa were written about and identified.\nEducator William E. B. DuBois testifying on the UNCIO (United Nations Conference on International Organization) charter during hearings by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\nDu Bois campaigned vigorously for the capitalization of the word Negro roughly a century ago when it was the accepted term at that time, said Hines, the Stanford professor.\nIn 1910, the US Census included an item called \"color or race\" for the first time. The instructions permitted people to use \"Mu\" for mulatto and \"Ot\" for other and \"B\" was called \"black,\" Pew Research Center reported. The word black \"included \"all persons who are evidently full blooded negroes.\"\nDu Bois, one of the founders of the NAACP, started a letter-writing campaign in the 1920s calling on publications such as The New York Times to capitalize the letter N in Negro.\n\"I regard the use of a small letter for the name of 12 million Americans and 200 million human beings, as a personal insult,\" Du Bois wrote in the 1920s, according to the book \"How to Be Good with Words.\"\nThe Times turned Du Bois down in 1926 and eventually relented in 1930. The newspaper called the change \"not merely a typographical change\" but \"an act in recognition of racial self-respect,\" The Times wrote earlier this month when it decided to capitalize Black.\nRoughly 40 years before the Times changed its stance on Negro, Johnson published \"A School History of the Negro Race in America from 1619 to 1890.\"\nThe book offers \"sketches of slavery as it existed in the colonies \u2014 northern and southern\" and describes the \"accomplishments of some of the most distinguished slaves,\" the University of North Carolina wrote in a summary of the book.\nJohnson's book was published in 1890. It implored teachers to adopt the use of Negro with a capitalized N.\n\"I respectfully request that my fellow-teachers will see to it that the word Negro is written with a capital N,\" Johnson wrote. \"It deserves to be so enlarged, and will help, perhaps, to magnify the race it stands for in the minds of those who see it.\"\nAttorney Edward Austin Johnson\nDiscussions around racial identification and the use of Negro continued well into the mid-1900s.\nThe word Negro remained on the Census in the 1960s during the heart of the civil rights movement. The word was commonly used by civil rights leaders, including the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. For example, in a speech he gave in 1960, King said, \"The shape of the world today does not permit America the luxury of exploiting the Negro and other minority groups. The price that America must pay for the continued oppression of the Negro is the price of its own destruction.\"\n\"Black\" did not reappear on the Census form until 1970, Pew said.\nIn 1971, the Congressional Black Caucus was formed. Its name suggested how the civil rights and black power movements left behind terms such as African, colored and Negro. By 2013, the Census Bureau dropped the word from its surveys, NPR reported. President Barack Obama signed a law in 2016 that replaced \"Negro\" with \"African American,\" amending the Department of Energy Organization Act and the Local Public Works Capital Development and Investment Act of 1976.\nCapitalizing the b in Black is not enough\nEducating teachers and school districts on Black history is paramount in making sure the change from black to Black is more than just a gesture, said Anyiwo, the developmental psychologist.\nRight now, Black history is integral to American history, but not a requirement to earn a degree in teaching, nor is it a required subject area for teacher certification exams such as the Praxis, said Valerie Adams-Bass, an assistant professor of Youth and Social Innovations in the Department of Human Services at the University of Virginia Curry School of Education.\nAdams-Bass has done research that shows how students with more Black history knowledge had higher career aspirations, she said.\n\"This is important because most Black children are taught by White and other non-Black teachers who often assume Black children are low achievers or dislike schools,\" she told CNN. \"Black children are also overlooked for AP courses and other opportunities that expose and prepare them for college based on racial bias. Having more Black history knowledge meant youth had high career aspirations, perhaps in spite of teacher perceptions.\"\nWhy saying 'Black' with a capital B isn't enough\nA big part of Black history is educating children on Black people that make up the fabric of American existence, Anyiwo said. Students must be exposed to the realities of how Black people in America were enslaved and subjugated to centuries of racial marginalization and oppression from the institution of slavery to Jim Crow laws to mass incarceration, she added.\n\"We cannot truly 'capitalize' Black until we teach about how the beauty and power of Black resistance and advocacy for social justice have contributed to advances in the rights and freedoms of all Americans,\" Anyiwo said.\nCalifornia is one state that has already taken steps to address racial issues in its education system.\nThe state has some of the most teachers and students in the US, according to data from Educationdata.org and Brandman University. It's also one of the largest markets for history textbooks, according to the New York Times.\nFollowing Floyd's death, state superintendent Tony Thurmond called on communities across California to take action to dismantle institutional racism and inequities in public schools and beyond, the California Department of Education (CDE) told CNN in an email.\nA $500,000 grant was awarded to the CDE in June to fund the California Implicit Bias Training Initiative. This initiative involves experts training employees on implicit bias and racial justice, the CDE said in a news release. California is also considering a curriculum adjustment that would allow \"school districts to adapt their courses to better reflect the pupil demographics in their communities,\" the news release said.\n\"The curriculum taught in our schools has not done enough to highlight and preserve the contributions of people of color and has actually minimized the importance of their role,\" the news release said. \"A movement to create a better model of inclusion to be taught in our K--12 system was established in the hopes of teaching a history that is more representative of what actually occurred. Ethnic studies as a whole should represent a broad range of topics, but it must devote a special emphasis to people of color, including their experiences and their important role in our state and national history.\"\nOne person heartened by these developments in K-12 education is Broussard, the history textbook author. Floyd's death was a catalyst, he said.\n\"Change comes about slowly. This seems to be a more accelerated change than we've seen and almost a throwback to the 1960s,\" Broussard said. \"I'm happy and heartened. Frederick Douglass said over a hundred years ago, 'Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will.' These are people out marching and protesting and raising their voices. And that has made all the difference in the world.\""}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/29/us/paul-howard-rayshard-brooks-shooting/index.html", "headline": "5 things to know about the district attorney who charged the officers in the Rayshard Brooks case", "published_date": "2020-06-29", "text": "(CNN)When he was about 14 years old, Paul L. Howard Jr. sat in a Burke County, Georgia, courtroom with his classmates to watch a trial for a school lesson.\nThe case involved two Black defendants and a White alleged victim, who told the all-White jury, \"If my gun had not stuck, those two [n-word] wouldn't be here in court today.\"\n\"I can still hear him saying that,\" Howard told CNN.\nHoward said that incident spurred him to become a prosecutor.\nToday, as district attorney for Fulton County, Georgia's most populous county, Howard is no stranger to high-profile cases. Lately, however, Howard himself has been the center of national attention after he swiftly charged two White Atlanta police officers in the fatal shooting of Rayshard Brooks, a Black man.\nFulton County District Attorney Paul Howard speaks at a news conference on Wednesday, June 17, 2020, in Atlanta.\nBrooks's death has reignited nationwide protests over race and policing that were sparked by the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.\nBut the charges have also drawn accusations that Howard -- whose ongoing campaign for another term in office is already dogged by controversy -- charged the officers for political benefit.\nHoward denies these allegations.\nAs he dodges criticism amid a run for a 7th term, here are five things to know about Howard.\nHe is Georgia's first Black elected district attorney\nHoward was elected to the Fulton County District Attorney's Office in 1996, becoming Georgia's first elected African American district attorney.\nWhen Howard took office in January 1997, he said the county and Atlanta were \"beset with crime.\" He vowed to reduce it.\nToday Howard touts a higher conviction rate, which he says is 92%. His office has created several prosecution units, including those focused on crimes against women and children, white collar crime and cold cases.\nHoward has established programs to prevent crime and reduce recidivism rates. The latest is Project Level Up, a program with the public defender's office and the juvenile court system that focuses on repeat juvenile offenders.\nAtlanta is once again at the center of the nation's struggle with race and civil rights\nAnother Howard initiative includes the Conviction Integrity Unit, which reviews cases and overturns wrongful convictions. This year, an inmate serving a life sentence on a drug offense was released after two decades in prison.\nHoward said the rates of violent crime and overall crime in Atlanta have dropped significantly since he took office. Howard also said he has reduced the Fulton County jail population by half since taking office, saving taxpayers millions of dollars.\nHe's prosecuted high-profile cases, including Ray Lewis' murder trial\nOne well known case from early in his 23-year tenure was the trial of NFL player Ray Lewis, who was charged with murder along with two companions in connection with the deaths of two men following a post-Super Bowl celebration in early 2000.\nBy many accounts, the trial did not go well for Howard. His office eventually dropped the murder charges against Lewis, who pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice and agreed to testify against his two co-defendants. In the end, both were acquitted.\nFulton County District Attorney Paul Howard addresses members of the media outside of Fulton County Superior Court in Atlanta after Ray Lewis pleaded quilty to a misdemeanor in June 2000.\n\"The story of that case is a great example of what happens when a prosecutor rushes to judgment without having all the facts,\" said Page Pate, a Georgia criminal defense attorney.\nHoward dismissed claims he rushed the case. \"It could be 10 years down the road, and that's what a defense attorney will say: 'You rushed to judgment,'\" Howard said.\nThe Atlanta Public Schools cheating scandal, one of US public education's largest ever, represents another prominent case for Howard. Eleven of 12 defendants -- including executive administrators, a principal and four teachers -- were convicted of racketeering and other charges.\n\"He got a lot of criticism about bringing that case, about prosecuting those teachers,\" said Pate, who represented one of the teachers. But Pate also credits Howard for how he allowed his prosecutors to handle the case, including then-prosecutor Fani Willis, who is now running to unseat her former boss.\nHe's in a runoff election for his 7th term\nHoward is fighting to keep his office.\nHe's in a run-off election against Willis after he came in second in the Democratic primary earlier this month -- he obtained 35% of the vote to Willis's 42%. In Georgia, elections go into a run-off if no candidate collects 50% of the vote in a primary.\nHoward's performance, coupled with the speedy charges against Atlanta police officers, has resulted in accusations he charged the officers in the Brooks case because it could benefit him politically.\nIn a statement last week, the Georgia Sheriff's Association called the charges a \"grandstanding vote-seeking tactic,\" and said they were \"more about (Howard's) re-election than justice for the officers involved, the Atlanta Police Department and the citizens of our state.\"\nPate likened the case to a \"political gift\" for Howard. \"He is running as fast as he can to make prosecutorial decisions that may at the end of the day be the correct decisions,\" Pate said, \"But make no mistake, the timing is driven by the politics.\"\nDA in Brooks case: It's the same criticism every time 01:21\n\"I think that's ridiculous,\" Howard told CNN when asked about the claim. He said the case would be his office's 40th case charging a police officer, nine of which involved the death of someone by police.\nSome have complained Howard did not wait for the Georgia Bureau of Investigation to complete its investigation in the Brooks shooting. Howard said his office has no obligation to wait.\n\"The DA's office is an independent office. We've got our own investigators, our own lawyers. So when we get cases, we don't make decisions based upon what somebody else says,\" he told CNN.\nOne criticism of Howard is he is a micromanager, forcing prosecutors to run decisions through him for his approval, according to Atlanta criminal defense attorney Bruce Harvey, who has represented clients charged by Howard's office, including one of the defendants in the Ray Lewis case.\nHarvey said Howard's management style is dysfunctional and inefficient, particularly for a DA's office in a major metropolitan area.\nEx-officer who fatally shot Rayshard Brooks shot a suspect three times in 2015 and was concerned he'd face charges\n\"It affects the community, it affects families and it affects the perception of whether or not justice is being done in the courts and in this community,\" said Harvey, who supports Willis and has contributed to her campaign.\nSenior Fulton County Superior Court Judge Jerry Baxter, who presided over the cheating trial, said in an email that Howard's \"leadership style\" has resulted in lawyers quitting and going to work for other DA's offices, calling it a \"real shame\" for the county.\nHoward, calling the critique \"strange,\" said the office changed so a line attorney cannot dismiss a case without a supervisor's permission. Before, he said, cases got dismissed that shouldn't have.\n\"It is the district attorney who has to answer for those cases, and not the line attorneys,\" he said.\nFulton County District Attorney Paul Howard talks with the media following a hearing in Fulton County Superior Court in April 2015 in Atlanta.\nHe's under investigation by the GBI and has been accused of ethics violations\nComplicating his chances of re-election is the fact that Howard is under criminal investigation by the GBI.\nGBI spokeswoman Nelly Miles told CNN the agency began a criminal investigation of Howard following an April request by the state Attorney General's office. The GBI would not confirm why it is investigating and declined to comment further.\nHoward said he \"didn't have anything to hide.\"\nHoward has been accused of 14 ethics violations by the state ethics commission after he failed to disclose his roles in non-profit organizations in financial disclosure reports.\nAccording to a complaint by the Georgia Government Transparency and Campaign Finance Commission, between 2015 and 2019 Howard did not disclose that he was the CEO of two nonprofit organizations, including one called People Partnering for Progress.\nOfficers feel abandoned while protesters demand sweeping police reform\nCiting tax filings, the ethics commission complaint says over several years Howard paid himself at least $165,000 \u2014 supplemental income he never reported in his financial disclosure reports.\nThe AJC previously reported Howard received the money in two grants from the city of Atlanta because he felt he was underpaid.\nIn response to the GBI investigation and the ethics complaint, Howard told CNN he believes he will be \"totally exonerated.\"\nHoward said he did not make the disclosures in the financial report because he didn't know it was necessary and said he has since amended those filings.\nHoward confirmed he received the \"salary supplements\" from the city, and he sent then-Mayor Kasim Reed a letter indicating the money would be \"administered by the non-profit.\"\n\"I have not done anything wrong,\" he said.\nHe's been accused of sexual misconduct and gender discrimination\nHoward faces another set of allegations. Three women who work for him, or previously did so, have filed lawsuits accusing Howard of sexual misconduct and harassment and gender discrimination.\nIn a lawsuit filed in February, Jasmine Younge, Howard's deputy chief of staff and director of policy and programs, accused Howard of discriminating against her after she told him that she was pregnant and that it was considered high risk.\nThe lawsuit claims Howard immediately began looking to replace Younge. He excluded her from meetings and reassigned her duties, according to the lawsuit.\nTwo weeks after Younge notified Howard that she was pregnant, Howard asked for her resignation, the lawsuit says. When she refused, she says she was terminated.\nAnother lawsuit filed in April alleges Howard used his authority to pressure another employee, Cathy Carter, for sex, including by helping her son \"resolve multiple criminal issues.\" When Carter relented, she was promoted, the lawsuit says.\nThis went on because Carter, the lawsuit says, feared retaliation, but when she refused Howard's alleged advances she was moved to a different office building with a different job.\nFulton County District Attorney Paul Howard takes questions about the investigation into a shooting at the Fulton County Courthouse in March 2005.\nAnother suit, filed in May by human resources director Tisa Grimes, accuses Howard of sexual harassment, alleging he repeatedly made uninvited sexual comments and groped her.\nHoward allegedly threatened to remove Grimes from her position while continuing the alleged harassment, the lawsuit says. After Grimes filed an equal employment opportunity complaint against Howard, he sent her to another office building and stripped her of her title and duties as retaliation, according to the lawsuit.\nAccording to the AJC, an independent investigation sanctioned by Fulton County determined the allegations by Grimes were unfounded.\nHoward did not address the specifics of each of the lawsuits but said they were politically motivated. Howard pointed out the lawsuits were all filed \"within weeks of the general election,\" referring to them as \"campaign suits.\"\n\"I think people can see through it,\" he said. \"Guy's been in office for 23 years and then a month or two before the election these harassment suits are filed.\"\n\"I believe that Atlanta is probably the best place to lead the rest of the world in changing what is going on with policing in this country,\" the district attorney said. \"And I'm looking forward to being a part of that process.\""}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/27/us/ole-miss-university-mississippi-name-controversy/index.html", "headline": "The Battle over Ole Miss: Why a flagship university has stood behind a nickname with a racist past", "published_date": "2020-07-27", "text": "(CNN)Cities, colleges and even the US Capitol are seeing growing battles over statues or building names after the killing of George Floyd.\nThe University of Mississippi is facing a fight over its very identity.\nLike other universities, the state's flagship campus in Oxford is not generally addressed by its full name. For more than a century, it's been called Ole Miss. It sounds like folksy shorthand for Old Mississippi.\nThe term's actual origin is more unsettling.\nIn 1896, a fraternity-backed council asked students to name the new school yearbook. Student Elma Meek proffered Ole Miss.\nShe borrowed it from the vernacular of the antebellum \"darkey,\" who used it as a term of reverence for the slave master's wife, Meek told the university newspaper in 1937.\nThe story, which explains how the term became \"the valued possession\" of the university at large, ran under the headline: \"Ole Miss takes its name from darky dialect, not abbreviation of state.\"\nThe day's biggest stories in 10 minutes or less.\nSign up and get access to videos and weekly student quizzes.\nSign Me Up\nNo, Thanks\nBy subscribing you agree to our\nprivacy policy.\nPlenty of students and alum say the name has evolved to embody all that's good about the northwest Mississippi school and its traditions. Others -- including many Black students, who make up 12.5% of the student body in a state where African Americans compose triple that percentage of the population -- point to Meek's words and ask: How could Ole Miss mean something else?\n\"I had often heard old 'darkies' on Southern plantations address the lady in the 'big house' as 'Ole Miss,'\" Meek told the school paper 40 years after the term's advent. \"I have never thought much about the matter, for I never dreamed, of course, that the term would grow into such popularity and favor.\"\nShe felt the term was a tribute to Southern women, the paper reported.\n'We will continue to use the terms'\nTo be clear, this isn't breaking news. The Ole Miss origin story is an open secret. Two sources, with something less than conviction, offered an alternate theory -- about a train that ran from Memphis to New Orleans -- but the tale doesn't withstand academic or journalistic rigor.\nOn its own website, the university explains Elma Meek Hall, which houses the art department, is named for \"the student who submitted the name Ole Miss for the name of the annual yearbook; Ole Miss subsequently became synonymous with the University of Mississippi.\" A cached version of a 2013 university yearbook webpage also credits Meek.\nA Confederate statue on campus is lowered as part of relocation process earlier this month.\nThe university declined CNN's requests to discuss the matter with the chancellor or provost, saying, \"Our leadership is absorbed with Covid-19 planning as we prepare to resume on-campus operations safely.\"\nIn 2016, then-Chancellor Jeffrey Vitter tamped down concern about the university retiring Ole Miss or its mascot, the Rebels, saying the university would continue to use them because they're popular and have taken on new meanings. A Rebel was no longer a Confederate; she or he was now \"someone who bucks the status quo,\" he wrote.\n\"I can assure you that we will continue to use the terms Ole Miss and Rebels as endearing nicknames for the university,\" Vitter wrote.\nUM has been here before\nThe Battle of Ole Miss hasn't materialized with the same intensity as fights over Robert E. Lee statues, but on a campus with so many remnants of the Confederacy in an era of increasing intolerance for the tributes, it could be next. Traditionalists have been steeling themselves for it, gathering on social media to preemptively defend Ole Miss' honor.\nThey see what's happened across the nation since Floyd's death. His killing ignited a simmering movement to redefine the legacies of Confederates and other historic figures -- and statues have dropped like bowling pins since.\nTributes to Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson and Jefferson Davis have already fallen. Military bases with Confederate namesakes, such as Fort Benning and Fort Bragg, are in the crosshairs. Vice President John Calhoun's name was stripped from buildings Clemson. His statue fell in Charleston. Princeton nixed President Woodrow Wilson. In some instances, protesters have pulled the tributes down themselves.\nTo understand the coming conflagration, know the University of Mississippi has been in a state of war over ideas for more than two decades. Its 1997 \"stick ban\" was viewed as a slick way of getting Confederate flags out of football games without irking alumni. UM booted its mascot, Colonel Reb, six years later. It stopped flying the Confederate-themed state flag in 2015. It quit playing \"Dixie\" at games. The school, too, has rechristened buildings and added \"contextualization plaques\" to others, some built by slaves.\nGuard Blake Hinson transferred to Iowa State, citing UM's ties to the Confederacy.\nUniversity leaders were more resistant to demands they take down a 30-foot Confederate monument that has stood prominently on campus since 1906, but the statue was relocated this month. A new controversy sprouted when plans surfaced for a privately funded facelift for the statue's new location that will cost up to $1.2 million. Opponents accuse the university of building a shrine to the Lost Cause of the Confederacy.\n\"It feels like you're in the Upside Down. Everywhere else in the country these statues are coming down,\" UM associate history professor Anne Twitty said. \"You feel like you're fighting the battle of 15, 20 years ago.\"\nThinking back on the struggles she's seen since joining the faculty in 2010, she said, \"The battle over Ole Miss will be particularly hot.\"\nLast month, Blake Hinson, a guard on UM's basketball team, put the school's ties to the Confederacy in the headlines by transferring to Iowa State.\n\"I'm proud not to represent that flag anymore and to not be associated with anything representing the Confederacy,\" the Florida native told The Daytona Beach News-Journal in June. Iowa State would not make Hinson available for an interview.\nAlso last month, the university esports team dropped all references to \"Rebels.\"\nThe dangerous messaging at play\nJack Carey received his master's and doctorate at the university. He devoted a section of his dissertation to \"the invention of Ole Miss\" and is writing a book, \"Jim Crow U.,\" about flagship Southern universities during segregation.\nThe story of Ole Miss' origin, he said, is but one example of the school's deliberate efforts to hitch its image to the Old South and Confederacy. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries -- as old Confederates convulsed at the notion of civil rights and crafted Jim Crow laws to strip Black people of rights -- the university covered the campus with Old South iconography, Carey and others say.\n\"There's really no ambiguity about what (Elma Meek's) tapping into: a romanticized vision of the Old South and slavery,\" said Carey, a University of Alabama instructor of American studies. \"A lot of people don't think that much about it, which makes it all the more important to acknowledge the origin. It's quite a bit to try to explain away or rationalize.\"\nAside from sending an unwelcoming message to more than a third of the state's residents, who are Black -- along with those who feel those residents' lives and feelings matter -- retaining the nickname poses deeper dangers in its messaging, he said:\n\"It requires imagining enslaved people felt affection or endearment toward slaveholders.\"\nIt props up the myth of the White savior, a paternalistic figure who was necessary to civilize the Black race.\nAnd it ignores the brutality, violence and force necessary to maintain slavery.\nBy romanticizing slavery, Carey said, an institution doesn't have to confront it.\n\"To speak honestly about the origin requires a pretty serious reckoning not just with the name but also the institution's identity,\" Carey said.\nBy fighting to keep its name and other holdovers of the Confederacy, he said, the university sends a strong message to prospective Black students: \"Go somewhere else.\"\n\"That is not the way that a flagship state university should be imagining itself,\" Carey said. \"That's really exclusionary in terms of who that university would welcome, and its commitment to academic freedom and diversity of thought.\"\n'I think rebellion is a good thing'\nNot everyone concurs with Carey. On Facebook and in interviews, many students and alumni -- and some would argue most -- feel the same way the university does about keeping Ole Miss. Despite their alignment with university leaders, they worry because the school has defended traditions like Colonel Reb and \"Dixie\" in the past, only to relent under pressure, said Howie Morgan, a 2000 graduate and political consultant.\nMorgan co-founded the Colonel Reb Foundation in 2003 to honor the wishes of the 94% of students who voted that year to keep the colonel, he said.\n\"I think the problem that anyone's going to have in the current climate is the University of Mississippi, through its leadership over the last several decades, has not been honest with the students, alumni and fan base in their argument to change the symbols,\" he said.\nGrowing up with Southern parents in Vicksburg, \"I didn't know what racism was,\" he said. The Confederate flag is just a symbol -- \"the Cowboy hat of the South\" -- made popular by Lynyrd Skynyrd and \"The Dukes of Hazzard,\" he said.\nA Mississippi fan takes a picture with some dressed up a former mascot, Colonel Reb, in 2015.\nThat the Ku Klux Klan and other hatemongers co-opted the flag after the Civil War is just an example of groups stealing symbols, he said: \"The Klan also used an American flag. The Nazis also stole a Christian symbol.\"\nHe frowns on efforts to change Ole Miss or Rebels, echoing his alma mater's assertion that they've taken on new meanings. Those who fought for suffrage and to end child labor were rebels, he said.\n\"I think rebellion is a good thing,\" he said.\nHe worries outside pressure is pushing administrators to \"change from a niche market into a more bland university so we would blend in with all the other universities across the United States.\"\n'We're destined to repeat the bad'\nFor senior Lauren Moses, a columnist for the school paper, the controversial symbols, along with Ole Miss and Rebels, are not honors. They're reminders, she said.\n\"Things that happened around the Civil War, we remember those things. We don't celebrate them, but we remember. I don't think the majority of students who utter the words support neo-Nazis or racism,\" she said. \"For me, Ole Miss means both the good parts and the bad parts of our history.\"\nWhen graduate student Zach Borenstein wrote a February column urging students to stop saying Ole Miss (he'd be charged months later with vandalizing the Confederate statue), Moses fired back with a litany of traditions, including James Meredith integrating the school in 1962, that she associated with Ole Miss.\nJames Meredith sits on a park bench in Jackson with Keri Herrington and Eriyuanna Woods last month.\n\"From changing the school mascot to governing bodies voting to move the Confederate statue to contextualizing many buildings on campus, Ole Miss has lost its identity,\" the 21-year-old wrote. \"Those who do not take the time to understand the importance of tradition may never know the beauty of our campus.\"\nShe sees it as a microcosm of what's happening across the nation, where historic figures such as Christopher Columbus and Thomas Jefferson are removed from the context of their history and unfairly measured by today's norms and moral codes, she said.\n\"I see a sort of nihilism. We're trying to whitewash our history and get rid of everything that's bad,\" she told CNN. \"I think that's dangerous for society and dangerous for Ole Miss specifically. We're destined to repeat the bad.\"\n'If they're not willing to unlearn, we're at a standstill'\nCarl Tart, 22, the university's first homecoming king, faced backlash when he told his family he was attending UM. Relatives disapproved of its racist and Confederate history, he said, but he had attended an all-Black high school in Yazoo City.\n\"I knew the world wasn't going to be all Black,\" he said. \"I wanted to learn how to navigate the world with people who are different from me.\"\nOnce on campus, he'd experience a range of racism. He shared anecdotes about hateful messages Facebook and screen grabs of death threats on Snapchat targeting Black students. Other bigotry he experienced was more Archie Bunker than Bull Connor, he said.\nWhite students at pep rallies couldn't tell star wide receiver D.K. Metcalf from other Black players, he said. They'd blurt out the n-word while singing along with rap music in local bars. At tailgates in The Grove, Tart and other Black students had to check each other's backs to make sure no one put \"Our State Flag\" stickers on them. Unwilling to study in halls named for racists (the contextualization plaques \"didn't go far enough\"), Tart did most of his schoolwork at home, he said.\nDespite his stature, 6-foot-5 and almost 300 pounds, he found himself anxious when a vehicle pulled alongside him bearing the Confederate flag.\n\"I tense up because I have no idea if these people are about to target me. I have no clue what's going to happen from this point forward,\" he said.\nOn June 19, he issued an ultimatum: If his alma mater breaks ground on a shrine glorifying the relocated Confederate statue, count him out of any marketing initiatives expected of him as homecoming king.\n\"It's time for change and change is happening whether people like it or not. We have to start leaving behind these old traditions and these old prejudiced ways and bring positivity to the change,\" he said.\nNow a graduate student at Louisiana State, Tart bristles at the idea Ole Miss can be \"rebranded\" with new meaning. He doesn't understand how university leaders can continue to justify its use, he said.\n\"We're expected to basically assimilate into a culture that's not ours. You can teach a person so many things, but if they're not willing to unlearn, we're at a standstill,\" he said. \"It's not OK you're allowing Black students to live in fear.\"\nA conflicted Black student experience\nArielle Hudson, a Rhodes scholar and outgoing president of the Black Student Union, which has been demanding the removal of UM's Confederate tributes for decades, says changing Ole Miss is trickier than altering the state flag or moving a statue.\n\"The biggest problem is Ole Miss is a brand. It's making money,\" she said.\nThe 22-year-old graduated in May and is destined for the other Oxford, in England, come fall, but she has made the drive from her hometown, Tunica, for campus protests. The statue has spawned a few.\nOle Miss has come to represent the school's strong sports programs and academics, supporters say.\nWhen Borenstein was charged with vandalizing the statue, she raised his bail money because \"his stance was strong. I wanted to help him out.\" (Borenstein's case remains open, according to the Lafayette County Justice Court.)\nAs a young orientation ambassador, Hudson recalls debunking \"wild\" rumors from prospective Black students -- no, the KKK doesn't live on campus; no, they're not still lynching people in Oxford -- while affirming other disturbing elements of the university's history.\n\"Some of this stuff happened, but that doesn't mean you don't belong here,\" she'd tell them.\nShe occasionally wears Ole Miss apparel but takes a harder line on Rebels gear. Her aunt won't wear any of it, she said. Depending on Hudson's audience, Ole Miss might slip out in conversation, but never in interviews or academic settings. Still, Hudson thinks the sobriquet sends a negative message, she said.\n\"I think it definitely means we haven't come to terms with all the history of the University of Mississippi and our role with slavery, with Jim Crow, within the Reconstruction era,\" she said.\nHonesty and transparency are often missing from the debate, she said, echoing a complaint heard from both sides. Administrators too often announce a victory, only to hatch secret plans \"to glorify Lost Cause mythology rather than contextualize Civil War history,\" which is what Hudson believes happened with the statue, she said.\nReal dialogue means listening to all sides and using opposing arguments to hone her own, she said.\nJefferson Davis descendent: State flag should represent population 01:08\n\"You have to get more people engaged with that history and understanding that history,\" she said. \"Education pulls people to your side.\"\nAdministrators also do the right things for the wrong reasons, she and other students and faculty complained.\nThe stadium stick ban was purportedly about safety, rather than denouncing the Confederate flag. Ditching \"Dixie\" and Colonel Reb were couched as efforts to make pregame more inclusive. The new names for buildings and the statue relocation came after a consulting firm said such honors hurt the school's reputation.\n\"That's not the only problem or the main problem,\" she said, explaining that just once she'd like hear university leaders say, \"No matter how much it costs or how much we lose, it's wrong and we're going to take it down.\""}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/05/us/chop-seattle-police-protesters-public-safety/index.html", "headline": "They envisioned a world without police. Inside Seattle's CHOP zone, protesters struggled to make it real", "published_date": "2020-07-05", "text": "Seattle (CNN)In Wednesday's early morning hours, Seattle police cleared the Capitol Hill Organized Protest area, a relatively quiet end to a demonstration that had evolved into an art party, a garden, a tourist attraction, a tent city, a presidential fixation and the scene of multiple shootings, two of them fatal.\n\"This is like being rescued by your abuser,\" J.R.P. said of the police effort. The HVAC system of her apartment building in the CHOP territory -- named for the neighborhood and once called the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone -- had been contaminated four times during the protests by tear gas, and she was hit in the shoulder by a rubber bullet.\nBut she is not going to miss the protest. \"The CHOP was really good for a week,\" said J.R.P., who did not want her name published for fear she'd be fired from her job. \"The last two weeks it's been turned into a militant cult.\"\nHow it evolved is a case study in human nature, violence, mental illness, homelessness, and the difficulty in imagining a world without police.\nThere's a growing call to defund the police. Here's what it means\nProtesters wanted to end police violence against Black people by defunding the department by 50%. They argued armed officers shouldn't be called to respond to issues of mental health, homelessness, poverty. But once they created a police-free zone, they immediately had to deal with all those issues and more -- with only the donated time and supplies of fellow protesters, who still had day jobs. With police absent from the 6-square-block area, the experiment spun out of control, with accusations that it ended up causing exactly what it had aimed to stop: more violence against Black people.\nSeattle's protests following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody grew violent around the East Precinct. Police tried to prevent protesters from marching past it and to disperse the crowd with tear gas and pepper balls. Instead it became a kind of rallying point.\nGraffiti bearing the name of George Floyd is seen June 24 in Cal Anderson Park in the CHOP.\nOn June 8, police left the precinct. In an address to officers, Police Chief Carmen Best said \"leaving the precinct was not my decision,\" but \"ultimately, the city had other plans for the building and relented to severe public pressure.\"\n\"I was there the first night the police left,\" Tarika Powell said. Someone put a microphone and speaker outside the police building, and people talked about the change they wanted to see. She said they were unified on ending police brutality.\n\"There's nowhere else in the city where you have people coming together in conversations with one goal,\" she said. \"And that was one of the things that made it so wonderful and so appealing.\"\nThen, someone put up a sign: Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone. It's not clear which came first, the collective desire to set up the zone or the sign declaring it. But signs began popping up, and they were outrageous, and that made them funny. An official-looking traffic sign appeared on one corner: \"Alt Route Exit 1312. Free Capitol Hill -- Last Exit.\"\nThe first weekend of the CHOP had a kind of magical quality, where you could walk up to anyone and start talking. It didn't matter if they were kids or anarchists or old people, people dressed as wizards or as a giant pink pile of breasts.\nProtesters have occupied part of Seattle's Capitol Hill for a week. Here's what it's like inside\n\"One of the really awesome things about the space, before the shootings started, was it brought together people from all over Seattle,\" said Powell of Black Collective Voice, a group of organizers who met in CHOP. \"Even though Seattle is a very liberal place, it's divided by race and class. But there in CHOP you had people from various class and racial backgrounds coming together and supporting one cause.\"\nOn the cold Tuesday night of June 16, around 1 a.m., we found a couple dozen young people partying around a bonfire in a dry fountain. They were drunk and happy. We said we were journalists and showed our badges. A guy drinking from a red Solo cup grabbed it, held it to his hip, and said, \"If I had this, I'd be walking around this place like\" and then began strutting theatrically.\nHe also had an assignment for us. He pointed to the dozens of tents now planted on the lawn of Cal Anderson Park and whispered, \"Who are these people??\" He'd been playing basketball here his whole life, he said, and now the park was filthy. Why were people growing crops in it? Pointing to the garden, he posed the same question we'd already been asked by two other protesters: \"When did Black people say they needed more vegetables?\"\nIt was a good question. Some protesters had urged others not to treat the scene as a party so as not to detract from the message of defunding the police. Still the CHOP grew bigger every day: a free clothing site, free food tents, late-night dodgeball, a \"no cop co-op.\"\nA pop-up shop with free snacks, water and other items is seen June 9 near the Seattle Police Department's East Precinct.\nVolunteer medics, with training that ranged from first aid to professional nursing, had a couple tents in the parking lot of a taco restaurant. People passed out free masks to control the spread of Covid-19, and most people wore them, at least until the late-night party vibe took over. Protesters built gardens to plant crops, which a Seattle Public Utilities worker said was a problem because the park was on top of the watershed; she made them promise not to use nitrates. An urban farmer said he was going to graft the branches of fruit trees onto the park's trees so homeless people could just reach up and get something to eat.\nBut one of the most peculiar developments was the improvised security team. There were constant rumors that White power groups were just hours away, ready to bring violence. A cloud of paranoia hung over the protest. So, a defense operation evolved, with members often dressed in all black, carrying walkie-talkies, sometimes wearing balaclavas and occasionally body armor.\nRight-wing media says Antifa militants have seized part of Seattle. Local authorities say otherwise\nThe main security group was called the Sentinels, assisted by various leftist armed groups, who generally described themselves as offering protection for oppressed people from violence by the state, not as a replacement for government-vested power. Because maintaining a perimeter required organization and constant communication -- and that left behind something of a paper trail -- the security team also became one of the clearest ways to trace the evolution of the CHOP and its demise.\nA \"plan of action\" from the Puget Sound John Brown Gun Club, an anti-fascist organization, offered tips on de-escalation: Respond to nonviolence with nonviolence. If someone is being physically violent, the plan advised \"either de-escalate, use less lethal force to subdue, or leave the area.\" Do not respond with lethal force unless someone is using lethal force, it says. \"Don't be a cop.\" Avoid answering reports of \"Property damage or its prevention (we're not cops).\"\nArtists paint a streetwide sign that says Black Lives Matter over several blocks on June 11 in the CHOP.\nSome police saw protesters as vulnerable\nPolice saw the abandonment of the East Precinct as a humiliation, according to a Seattle police officer CNN spoke to a couple days after it happened. He did not want to be named because talking to journalists is against department policy.\nSeattle mayor tells Trump to 'go back to your bunker' after he criticizes her handling of protests\nHe was shocked at how quickly public opinion had turned. \"The city council is hostile to the police department,\" he said. \"The public turned against us.\" The protest chants were personal. Even his Facebook friends were posting memes about police brutality. \"My friends say, 'We need more cops like you. You're one of the good ones,'\" he said. \"I don't know what that means. I'm one of the normal ones.\"\n\"I think that we have a really good police department in this city, and people would rather believe we're fascists than that we have a good police department that sometimes has to be police,\" the officer said.\n\"What I want police reformers to understand is, if you're trying to make someone do something they don't want to do, you're eventually going to have to use force. You cannot de-escalate your way out of everything.\" He added, \"It's always going to look bad.\"\nThe police officer did not like the CHOP, but he worried the protesters were sitting ducks. On June 12, Seattle police officers were sent an email saying they should not respond to calls within the CHOP unless it was a \"mass casualty event,\" like an active shooter or a structural fire.\n\"Everybody loves firefighters and hates cops,\" he said. \"But they won't go in unless we go in.\"\nThat meant paramedics wouldn't go in either. In just over a week, this problem would no longer be theoretical.\nSeattle police walk past debris and bulldozing equipment near the East Precinct on July 1 after police cleared the CHOP.\nThreats, from errant drivers to drug crises\n\"In the beginning, we were there to look out for vehicles charging into the crowd,\" said Slate, who eventually led the security group and uses only a pseudonym.\nThen, it got more and more complex -- mental health calls, drug crises. Someone changed their group chat name to Sentinels, they said, and it felt good to formalize what they did. Slate became a leader, with a man who called himself James Madison his second in command. Black Collective Voice member Javi Cordero donated $400 worth of walkie-talkies. The John Brown Gun Club came in to help.\nTheir authority was \"reputation-based,\" Slate said, unlike the police, who got their authority by representing the government. The Sentinels had to \"maintain our reputation with the community so they respect us.\" There was a communications tent and training on how to use the radios.\nBut, Slate said, \"the situation just kept changing, and getting crazier and crazier and crazier.\"\nWithin a couple days, a Sentinels volunteer saw \"a major fistfight that turned bloody. ... I attempted to draw people away to give medics space to no avail.\" A few days later, the volunteer was responding to dozens of calls. \"There were several fist fights, a man who had snuck into the backyard of a Capitol Hill resident, and a large motorcycle gang rolled through that made my heart jump. It turned out that they were there to help with the barricade.\"\nFox News publishes digitally altered and misleading images of Seattle demonstrations\nIn the middle of the night in the first week, a white SUV started swerving through the CHOP, and people shouted to get out of the way. After a previous incident of a man driving into protesters and shooting a person in the arm, it seemed like a serious threat, and a crowd chased after the vehicle, someone yelling, \"Get his ass!\" When it stopped at a barricade inside the CHOP, a crowd pulled the door open. But the driver was not a White power terrorist, just an apparently drunk guy. They let him go.\nThey had to create a plan for ideological opponents who provoked the crowd and captured some damning footage. \"I'm sure you've seen the beautiful photoshop job Fox News did of me,\" Madison said. They were \"fighting an information war in addition to all the other stuff on the ground,\" Slate said.\nSome protesters dealt with provocateurs with wit. On June 13, a man in a Trump shirt and khaki shorts began marching through the field with an American flag. People were angry and shouted at him, someone stole his flag and his MAGA hat, then someone else returned his flag and his hat. An elderly man told the crowd not to yell and curse at him, and people hugged, and then finally Steffon Riggins, who'd been there protesting since the fights with police, just bought the guy's flag for $60. The man left, and Riggins stood in the center of the CHOP's main drag, the American flag draped over his shoulders.\nA man views an upside down US flag at the Seattle Police Department's vacated East Precinct on June 14 in the CHOP.\nThe power of de-escalation was repeatedly tested. In the park, a man experiencing homelessness set up a grill in the tent city, and called it something like \"Klay's Kommunity Kitchen,\" Madison said. \"He wrote KKK in grease,\" Madison said, \"and he stood by that.\" An angry crowd formed, and the security team had to figure out how to de-escalate it. They eventually got the crowd to disperse, got the man to shut down his grill and clean off the KKK, and then called in a mental health volunteer. \"We tried to not be the police but keep the peace.\"\nOne morning, at about 6:30 a.m., protester Michaud Savage saw two men running down the street. \"These homeless White dudes just start beating the s**t out of each other. I'm like, 'What do I even f**king do?'\" Savage said. He said he and others de-escalated the situation, and the men moved along. \"But I don't have training in that. I'm just a person.\"\nOne security volunteer who works as a social worker saw several clients in the CHOP. Over time, the tents in Cal Anderson Park housed more and more people who were otherwise homeless. Cordero estimated 40% to 60% of tent city residents were homeless in the late days of the CHOP. Black Collective Voice had decided to keep a \"safe distance,\" he said, \"because the CHOP is too large, too unstable, too dangerous a problem for one group to address, and it has been fundamentally thrown to the wolves by the city, in not providing the resources to keep it safe.\"\nCity crews on July 1 dismantle the CHOP.\nProtesters said they felt they'd been expected to solve society's most difficult problems on their own. \"People within the city are aware that it has long had a large population of people who have drug and mental health issues and who are homeless, who are not receiving any services from the city,\" Powell said.\nSeattle has the third largest homeless population in America, according to the most recent report from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development. Densely packed beds in homeless shelters maybe have contributed to the spread of the coronavirus, according to a CDC report on three city shelters. During the pandemic, the city removed homeless encampments, despite CDC guidelines against it. The city council then presented an emergency bill to limit camp removals.\n\"There's always been a population of those individuals around Cal Anderson\" Park, Powell said. \"The city of Seattle has continually failed them. Now, they use that population as a political ploy against CHOP.\"\nThe city blamed the CHOP for creating social and criminal problems that existed already, then said those problems would be fixed if police returned, she said. Mayoral spokeswoman Kamaria Hightower said, \"While Cal Anderson does have a history of people experiencing homelessness camping on the grounds, I think the timeline and Executive Order make clear that protecting demonstrators, those living on site, the residents in the area, and employees of local businesses from the escalating gun violence was the reason action had to be taken.\" Powell asked, \"How can we solve this problem within two weeks that you have failed to solve with decades of time and hundreds of millions of dollars in resources?\"\nThis perspective was shared by police. \"We're being asked to do way too many societal issues,\" Mike Solan, the president of the Seattle police union, said. \"That puts a lot of pressure on us as just human beings, but overall, in society, to have an answer, a solution, for everything we might encounter.\"\nThe police chief \"has repeatedly spoken of her dedication to holistic policing,\" SPD spokeswoman Sgt. Lauren Truscott said, and the department works with regional partners on \"mental health, substance abuse, and other root factors in crime that go beyond policing.\"\nPeople hang out in the Conversation Cafe on June 12 in the CHOP.\nShots ring out and tensions spike\nEarly on June 20, a 19-year-old named Lorenzo Anderson, was shot near the medic tents near the taco restaurant. Protesters claim that volunteer medics treated him on the scene, called for an ambulance to come, but it would only get as close as a couple blocks away. Police say they weren't allowed entry. Anderson was pronounced dead at the hospital. Around the same time, DeJuan Young, 33, was shot just outside CHOP barriers. In a security group chat, one person describes discovering Young's chest wound as a medic was treating him. He lived.\nPolice released body cam video of them responding to the scene. An angry crowd shouts that the victims had already been taken to the hospital.\nResidents and businesses sue Seattle over protest zone\nThe shock of the first shooting, Slate said, was that people in the CHOP had expected paramedics to enter the zone if someone was seriously hurt. They were wrong. \"That was wiped clean after the first (shooting),\" Slate said. \"But it cost a human life.\"\nAnderson's family demanded to know why the ambulance couldn't get in to treat him. Four protesters said some in the area blamed CHOP medics for being unable to save him, and it was not safe for medics to operate openly anymore. According to Slate, they faced threats. \"This is when the first of the gang stuff started,\" Slate said. \"Once that started and their involvement became known, the life of the medics became harder.\"\nThe CHOP medics left their tent near the taco restaurant parking lot. He added, \"We lost a significant number of riot medics because the nature of the injuries started changing. Not all of them are ready to have a man die on their hands.\" According to protesters, the John Brown Gun Club left, too.\nShooting in Seattle protest zone leaves one dead. Police say 'violent crowd' denied them entry\nThe next day, on Sunday evening, a third person was shot in the arm. He was 17. There was a vigil after the first shooting. \"There were a number of people present who were relatives or friends of the shooting victim,\" said one protester who attended. \"Based on hearing what they have said, it does appear that there is a connection to some sort of gang violence.\"\nAsked if the CHOP shootings were gang-related, Truscott, the SPD spokeswoman said, \"We do not normally discuss open/active investigations.\" Mayor Jenny Durkan in a July 1 news conference said, \"We don't know yet enough about those shootings to determine exactly who did it.\"\nBut within CHOP security group chats, there was frequent discussion that gangs were involved, warning of gang escalation and the presence of \"gangbangers.\"\nThe messages reveal the increasing danger of late-night CHOP. In voice memos circulated in one security group chat, someone reports, \"We're seeing multiple armed people -- non-right-wingers -- hanging around.\" Another warns, \"We have a couple of armed groups here trying to hold things down, but I would recommend that if you are not armed you stay away. If you are not armed and maybe even not armored, I would stay away.\"\nThere was another shooting early on the morning of June 23. The next day, the Sentinel security team left the CHOP. Walkie-talkies were handed over to a new team. \"We'd already made our peace with the fact that there were some things we weren't able to handle,\" Slate said. \"You can't be a target if you're not there. You can't make a bad decision if you're not there.\"\nAfter the June 21 shooting, Slate was crouched behind a concrete barrier with Madison. \"I got a rifle in my hand, he's got a rifle in his hand, and I said I really wish this were just a war zone. It'd be so much simpler.\" They wouldn't have to worry about legality, gangs, or mental health.\nPeople watch a screening of \"13th,\" a documentary film by director Ava DuVernay, on June 9 in the CHOP.\nThe Sentinels sign off\nOn June 29 at 3 a.m., a 14-year-old and a 16-year-old were shot in a car at a CHOP barricade. The 16-year-old was killed. The younger victim was hospitalized. Accounts of how it happened conflict. But videos from the moment show people running at the sound of gunfire. A voice memo sent to a CHOP security group said, \"Shots fired. May have been from our end, toward car coming in through barricades, barreling in through barricades.\" Messages to security groups say the car was driving either in or around the CHOP, and that people guarding the barricades shot into it.\nIn one video, when gunshots pause, someone shouts, \"So, you're not dead yet huh?\" In a CHOP safety group text, someone wondered who said it. Another person replied, \"God that was f**king haunting.\"\nAnother shooting in Seattle's police-free autonomous zone kills man and critically injures boy\n\"I saw two kids shot from my balcony,\" J.R.P. said. Her boyfriend tackled her and pulled her and their dogs into a closet. \"It was gunfire for two minutes straight.\" She'd been able to watch as the security situation evolved. \"The nice ones left and the bad ones showed up,\" she said. \"It went from daisies to barbwire.\"\nShe and her neighbors had talked about creating a support group for people who lived through it all, so they could smoke cigarettes and drink coffee and talk about the surreal experience with people who really get it. No one else understands.\nThe Sentinels bailed, too. They heard rumors they were targets of retaliation after the 16-year-old was killed. Slate told them to stop going to the CHOP. A security volunteer explained, \"A lot of people I know are not down for continuing to be part of something where we don't know if we're being used as pawns or not.\"\n17-year-old shot in Seattle protest zone\n\"There's three things really we weren't equipped for,\" Slate said. Sexual assault was one. Another was something that required a government agency like the ATF, because they'd found an AK-style rifle in an alley and had to deal with it. \"The third thing is homicide,\" they said. \"We weren't equipped for that.\"\nBut they had collected evidence with gloves and little plastic baggies. Madison said he had a meeting with homicide detectives later. \"The thing that really sucks is that we have to cooperate to some degree,\" Slate explained. \"Otherwise we're accessories and that's a crime itself. And that's not our objective.\"\n\"It's not CHOP's fault,\" Slate said. \"Violence is not born out of what CHOP did. Violence moved to CHOP. But Lorenzo is dead because of the CHOP because Lorenzo was in the CHOP. ...

I don't believe they would care or mention it if they could not use it as a political weapon against CHOP.\"\nThe police \"department routinely deploys significant resources whenever there are spikes in crime in a concentrated area,\" Truscott, the SPD spokeswoman, said. \"Our department also relentlessly investigates homicides in our city.\" The mayor's office pointed to its \"Reimagining Police\" memo, which outlines how the city \"has taken initial steps rooted in community demands to address policing and is committed to working towards lasting change.\"\nViolent crime typically increases in the summer in Seattle, and some of that is gang violence, according to SPD statistics. \"Some summer shootings, robberies and other crimes are committed by individuals with gang affiliation,\" Truscott said.\nSeattle police, at right, look on as Department of Transportation workers remove barricades Tuesday at the CHOP.\n\"Although the violence is coming from outside CHOP, we reject the invitation to disparage these young men,\" Powell said. \"People who are involved in gang activity are usually involved in that activity because they are poor and they do not see any means of not being poor besides engaging in criminal activity,\" she said. The protests were about \"White supremacy and capitalism,\" she added, and, \"they are victims of the same system.\"\nAt a \"decompression\" gathering over the weekend, security volunteers got together with their masks off.

He went on one Facetime date -- the girl, he said, seemed like she was \"just going through her matches ... like on a spreadsheet.\"\nBut on May 29, he had plans to meet up with a different match -- this time in person. A 28-year-old nurse named Brooke, with whom he would hike Runyon Canyon -- Los Angeles' picturesque, influencer-ridden trail.\nIt was in the middle of their approximately three-mile hike, when the two decided they felt comfortable enough to remove their face masks, that he knew this was different. Their guards were down, or as he described it, \"all caution (regarding coronavirus) was thrown to the wind.\"\nNow, less than one month and many dates later, they split most of their time between his West Hollywood apartment and hers in Long Beach. He's done what many initially considered impossible with social distancing guidelines and stay-at-home orders:\nHe found love during a global pandemic.\n\"This is truly two people finding their soulmate during the most unlikely of times,\" he told CNN in a phone interview. \"We're thinking about eloping to Vegas if the chapels open.\"\nSearching for love in the time of coronavirus\nWhile this may sound extreme, many formerly single people -- and dating experts -- say the pandemic has actually helped people find their matches more easily.\n\"I think people are more likely to find love during this time than not during this time,\" Yue Xu, co-host of the popular \"Dateable\" podcast, told CNN in a video call.\n\"Because we have this dedicated time to find love, there are no distractions -- you're not a bar looking at people around you or looking at your drink. Everyone's more present and they are more conscious about the way they are showing up to these virtual or real-life dates.\"\nXu and podcast co-host Julie Krafchick, who are based in San Francisco, said they've noticed an overall change for the better in terms of the dating landscape over the past few months.\n\"Consider this a reset,\" Xu said. \"Even though we're losing magic of that first date -- the first kiss, first touch -- we're forced to think about how we can reinvent dating.\"\nThe 'fail fast mentality'\nDating has never been -- and never will be -- perfect. Before the pandemic, Xu and Krafchick answered questions on their podcast such as \"Do Millennials even want to find love?\" and \"Is monogamy dead?\"\n\"We can't have amnesia that dating wasn't perfect before,\" Krafchick said. \"Part of the reason we created the podcast in the first place was to answer the question, 'What the f**k is wrong with modern dating?'\"\nThe biggest challenge for the singles out there before the pandemic, Krafchick said, was that many spent a lot of time in relationship limbo.\n\"No one wanted to say they were excited about someone,\" she said. \"No one wanted to define the relationship.\"\nNow, however, the pandemic has led to what Krafchick described as the \"fail fast mentality.\"\n\"People are starting to feel it's better to fail fast than be in this constant state of equilibrium,\" she said. \"Like, let's either get it off the ground or end it.\"\nYue Xu and Julie Krafchick host the \"Dateable\" podcast.\nThe podcast hosts have heard countless stories during these past few months of people who have successfully found love, and people who have felt more encouraged by their dating experiences even if their quarantine relationships didn't work out.\n\"Coming out of quarantine, everyone has a really strong feeling of a yes or no,\" Xu said.\nMany have also taken this time in quarantine to self reflect, which has helped pave the way to finding healthier relationships.\n\"I think this time has given people a lot of clarity into what they want in life,\" Krafchick said. \"It's shown life is short and at the end of the day, relationships are what matters most. A lot of people have used this time to do self work, especially in the dark middle period of quarantine, where it didn't feel like there was any way to meet someone.\"\nVirtual dates have also made people throw their old notions of dating out of the window, as they are forced to get creative. For example, \"there are 'Zootie' calls now,\" Xu explained. \"Zoom booty calls.\"\n'A whole other dimension of consent'\nWith this uncharted era of dating also comes new conversations around consent: Do you feel safe meeting in person during a pandemic? Do you agree to wearing masks on the first date? Do you feel comfortable being less than 6 feet apart?\nJessica Gerhardt, a Santa Monica, California, native, and her new partner -- they have not labeled the relationship yet -- waited three months before they decided to meet in person for the first time last week.\n\"He's way more conscientious than me,\" the musician said of the new guy in her life, who is also a musician.\nJessica Gerhardt and her new partner -- they have not labeled the relationship quite yet -- smile during one of the many video chats they had before meeting in person.\nThe two, who had mutual friends in the music scene, began talking after he \"slid into her DMs\" on Instagram. Before they met up, he researched and looked into data about social distancing, Gerhardt said.\n\"We both consented to hug when we first met,\" the 30-year-old told CNN. \"There's a whole other dimension of consent during this pandemic. Under normal circumstances, of course I'd want to hug -- but it was helpful to have that conversation before and nice to know if we don't do something it's not necessarily a sign of 'Oh, I'm not attracted or interested, but I'm trying to be considerate of your safety and vice versa.'\"\nThe lack of touching before meeting, Gerhardt said, made her feel like the two were cultivating \"deeper intimacy\" as they got to know each other.\nThey ended up going on a social distance walk in her neighborhood while both wore face masks. At the end of their walking date, he asked whether he could use her bathroom before he drove home.\n\"He came inside, and we both took off our masks after I asked, 'Do you feel comfortable being maskless?' and he said, 'I feel comfortable.' It was a nice surprise,\" she said. \"We ended up feeling comfortable enough to also hold hands and cuddle. It was really sweet.\"\nJessica Gerhardt snapped this photo on her first date with her new partner, where they took a walk in her neighborhood, while wearing masks.\nWhile they do not have plans to move in together any time soon, Gerhardt said he has now joined her quarantine pod, which includes her roommate and her roommate's boyfriend.\nLearning each other's values early on\nOn top of the pandemic, these past few months have seen nationwide protests demanding justice and an end to police brutality in the aftermath of the deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and Rayshard Brooks.\nHow people have acted during this time has helped provide a window into their beliefs, which for some singles has helped narrow down their pool of potential matches.\nLove under lockdown: The couples pushed together and kept apart by coronavirus\nFor example, on dating apps, many have said they have encountered photos of people holding \"Black Lives Matter\" signs at protests on their profiles. Others said they've seen people sporting face masks in their pictures, to highlight the fact that they are following social distancing guidelines recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in order to curb the spread of the virus.\n\"With the Black Lives Matter movement, Covid, and everything else that's been going on, it's been causing people to have way deeper conversations,\" Krafchick said. \"You can really quickly realize who has same values as you and who would be a better long-term partner. (Talking about) those things can really help you understand someone a lot better on a deeper level and get you past those basic dating questions.\"\nLiz Dwyer, who lives in LA, fell for a guy named Demis Courquet-Lesaulnier, who she has been messaging on Instagram since before the pandemic. He lives in Paris, and they had plans -- pre-coronavirus -- to meet abroad. Now, that plan has been put on hold.\nBut that hasn't slowed their relationship down at all. In fact, it's sped things up. Dwyer said she's gotten closer to her now-boyfriend these past few months virtually, thanks to many of the current events they discuss.\n\"We have completely different cultural backgrounds,\" the writer and editor told CNN. \"I'm American, he's French. I'm Black, he's White. We had to get to know each other -- not just on the 'I think you're good looking' and 'you're cute too' conversation.\"\nDwyer said Demis created a list of 54 films -- including \"BlacKkKlansman,\" \"13th\" and \"When They See Us\" -- \"to try and understand what it's like to be Black in America.\" The two have conversations about them, and discuss what he noticed, observed and learned from them. He even wrote a post titled \"A Love Letter to Black America\" to reflect on his takeaways.\n\"He was open to understanding what was happening in terms of racism,\" she said.\nWithout the pandemic, she doesn't know what their relationship would look like today.\n\"I don't know what the future holds,\" she added, \"but no matter what, the experience has changed me for the better.\"\nFinding your 'apocalypse partner'\nRonni Morgan, 32, and her partner Adriane (AJ) Johnson, 41, met on the HER app -- a dating app for queer people -- on March 23.\nThey started by texting, having FaceTime dates and watching Netflix together virtually, with Morgan in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and Johnson in Grand Rapids, Michigan.\nWhen they finally reached a point where they felt safe enough to start planning an in-person meeting, they found an AirBnB in between their two locations that they considered secluded and off-the-beaten path.\nFrom the beginning, Morgan said, the two were \"on the same page about how to handle the pandemic.\"\n\"We have both taken it very seriously,\" Morgan told CNN. \"I don't think we would've made it this far otherwise.\"\nWhen they finally did meet, on June 26, Morgan said their weekend together \"legitimately was like a lesbian romance novel, complete with a fireplace, velvety red blanket and epic thunderstorm.\"\n\"When we did finally get to meet in person, we were already so deeply connected there was no question of what the chemistry would be like,\" she told CNN.\nTheir relationship is still a long-distance one -- but Morgan said there's no doubt in her mind that she's found her \"apocalypse partner,\" aka the person to ride out the pandemic with.\n\"There's this meme that talks about how dating in 2020 is about choosing your apocalypse partner wisely and honestly I couldn't agree more,\" Morgan said. \"I can say, without a shadow of a doubt, there's no one I'd rather be braving the new world with than AJ.\"\nThe two have created a Facebook page and Instagram page dedicated to their love story.\n\"I never imagined I'd meet the love of my life during a global pandemic but here we are,\" Morgan wrote in a post sharing their story on Facebook.\n\"Anything is possible.\"\nMeeting at the virtual bar\nBack in March, Krafchick and Xu decided to bring their community of listeners together in a Facebook group they called \"Love in the Time of Corona by the Dateable Podcast.\" They said they felt it was important for people to feel less alone as quarantine began.\nYue Xu and Julie Krafchick take a selfie while hosting their podcast.\nSo far, the group has amassed more than 500 members -- who all actively utilize the group to share their experiences with dating in comments, over virtual happy hours, and, sometimes even with the two hosts as guests on their show.\nThursday afternoon, a \"Dateable\"-hosted virtual happy hour was in full swing, with about 20 people from across the United States -- some returning faces, others new to the hangout -- hopping on a video chat on Facebook.\nGroup members could check out different Facebook rooms, including: \"The Bar,\" where Krafchick and Xu kicked off the afternoon with intros. Then, some stayed behind to play a game of \"Would You Rather?\" with dating-themed questions.\n\"Would you rather date someone who is in a lot of debt but donates to charity on a regular basis,\" Xu asked the group, \"or someone who has no debt, but doesn't donate to charities?\"\nOthers joined the \"Playtime\" room, where they participated in dating-themed trivia. And some joined a new \"room\" called the \"Dance Floor,\" where one member taught a dance class."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/17/us/brooklyn-molotov-lawyers-protests/index.html", "headline": "How two promising lawyers found themselves facing life in prison for alleged Molotov cocktail attack during protests in NY", "published_date": "2020-06-17", "text": "New York (CNN)On an early October evening in 2014, a group of New York University law school students gathered for a joint birthday party at (Le) Poisson Rouge, a popular bar and music venue a few blocks from campus.\nOne of the birthday celebrants, Colinford Mattis, quickly hit it off with another guest, Urooj Rahman, who was studying law at Fordham. Both raised in Brooklyn, the two bonded over their professional interest in human rights and their engagement in local politics, becoming friends from there on.\nToday, Mattis, 32, and Rahman, 31, are in jail, facing federal charges alleging they participated in a Molotov cocktail attack on an empty New York Police Department vehicle during protests sparked by the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.\nThe promising young lawyers with enviable educational pedigrees and significant familial responsibilities -- he is raising three foster children; she is the primary caretaker for her elderly mother -- suddenly find themselves detainees indicted on seven federal felony charges for which they face life in prison. Their predicament has puzzled not only family and friends, but also prosecutors themselves.\n\"He's a person with an extraordinary career that was just starting in the law. He attended prestigious universities, he had some of the best education that you can have in this country and yet he risked everything -- everything -- to drive around in a car with Molotov cocktails attacking police vehicles,\" federal prosecutor Ian Richardson said during one of Mattis's initial court appearances.\n\"It is difficult for me, frankly,\" Richardson later added, \"to comprehend how somebody in his position with his background would do what he did.\"\nThe day's biggest stories in 10 minutes or less.\nSign up and get access to videos and weekly student quizzes.\nSign Me Up\nNo, Thanks\nBy subscribing you agree to our\nprivacy policy.\nA former colleague of Rahman's, Alicia Bella, said she couldn't reconcile the charges with the person she knew. \"I'm very surprised. My heart goes out to her, and I want to do everything I can to help her,\" she said. \"I know what this country does to people who express themselves. I'm definitely worried.\"\nProsecutors say the two lawyers drove Mattis's tan minivan late in the evening of May 29 to participate in widespread protests in Brooklyn's Fort Greene neighborhood. There, just before 1 a.m. on May 30, Rahman approached an empty NYPD vehicle with an already broken window and tossed in a makeshift explosive device, according to court filings. She also \"attempted to distribute Molotov cocktails to several other individuals and to incite them to use the Molotov cocktails in the course of the protests.\"\nThe van, driven by Mattis, then \"fled the scene,\" court documents say, and shortly thereafter police stopped the vehicle and found \"precursor items\" to build explosives, including a lighter, a Bud Light bottle stuffed with toilet paper and a gasoline tank. Both Mattis and Rahman have been indicted on charges including use of explosives, arson and civil disorder. They haven't entered a plea.\nThough the alleged actions of the two did not cause physical harm to any individual, their behavior, as described by prosecutors, came at the height of both the protests that swept the city and an eruption of destructive looting and property damage that sparked days of tension between police and those who had taken to the streets.\nBy all accounts, their alleged actions stand in contrast to their nature.\nAccording to their friends and lawyers and a review of their professional experiences and personal lives, Mattis and Rahman are lifelong social justice advocates with deep interests in civil rights and police reform, but neither displayed signs that they might engage in the sort of violent outburst of which they are accused.\n'He always wanted to use a law degree to do good in this world'\nMattis was raised and attended public school in East New York, a section of Brooklyn that has among the highest crime rates and lowest-performing schools in the city, according to public records.\nHe went on to attend St. Andrew's School, a prestigious private institution in Middletown, Delaware, where he published an essay for the school magazine that signaled his nascent interest in social and economic justice issues.\nHe wrote that, inspired by his colonial history class and the Kanye West song \"Diamonds from Sierra Leone,\" he had organized a forum on the trade of blood diamonds.\n\"As I researched the brutality of mining diamonds and lack of compensation, I was reminded of my time working at a fair trade coffee cooperative in Mexico over the summer,\" he wrote. \"There I learned the values of fair trade, and met the people who make an inexpensive commodity that Americans just consume. I realized that just because America is a capitalist society, success does not need to ultimately be 'someone loses and someone wins,' but rather everyone can win and have enough to live comfortably.\"\nAt Princeton University, where Mattis studied sociology and played rugby, he appears to have amassed a dedicated group of friends.\nDuring an early teleconference in his court case, his attorney, Sabrina Shroff, told the judge that \"almost all of the colleagues that he had at Princeton are either on this line, have called me or e-mailed me or offered to support him in one way or another.\"\nShe added: \"I could not overemphasize here the level of support that Colin has received from the Princeton community.\" Reached by CNN, she declined to comment for this story, though she told the court in a filing Tuesday that the alleged conduct outlined in the charges is \"highly aberrational.\" Of the suggestion Mattis would be involved in violent acts, she wrote, \"he is no such person.\"\nAfter two years teaching math and science in New Orleans as part of Teach for America, Mattis returned to New York City to attend law school, where he struck classmates as unaffected by the trappings of the institutions he had attended.\n\"I think it's very easy in that kind of setting to get wrapped up in the doctrine of the law and in grades, and he always wanted to use a law degree to do good in this world,\" said Olivia Ensign, a friend of his from law school who remains in close contact with him.\nTo Mattis, she said, that meant \"that it's not enough to really have access to these places of power and privilege, that you need to bring in other people and make sure that anything you do is with a sense of community and bringing down structural inequality.\"\nWhen he ran for social chair of the law school's student bar association, he described himself in his campaign pitch as \"pretty chill & super friendly + I like dopeness.\" He suggested that as chair he would push for food at events, puppies at dog therapy, \"and whatever fresh ideas y'all have.\"\nWhen he campaigned the next year to continue on as a third-year representative, Mattis advocated a plan for free or subsidized coffee on campus and to \"strengthen our intellectual community as a space for open and sincere discourse around legal and societal issues that matter.\"\n\"A vote for me is a vote for more awesome at NYU Law!\" he wrote.\nHe did corporate work at the law firm Holland & Knight after graduating, while volunteering for a group called Her Justice, which provides lawyers for women living in poverty. There, Mattis and another lawyer won an award for their advocacy for a mother seeking financial support for her young daughter, according to the group's website.\nSome law enforcement officers at protests have no badges and some have covered them. City officials say that is unacceptable\nMore recently, he worked at mid-size law firm Pryor Cashman LLP in its corporate practice group and was a member of the local community board in his childhood neighborhood of East New York, where he returned to live with his mother.\nHe was furloughed from the firm in April, amid the coronavirus pandemic, and after his arrest, the firm placed him on suspension without pay.\n\"As we confront critical issues around historic and ongoing racism and inequity in our society, I am saddened to see this young man allegedly involved in the worst kind of reaction to our shared outrage over what had occurred,\" the firm's managing partner, Ronald H. Shechtman, said in a statement at the time of Mattis's arrest.\nDuring his employment at Pryor Cashman, Mattis's home life took a turn, according to his lawyer and friends. His mother fell ill of uterine cancer while caring for three foster children. Last year, Mattis's mother died, and he assumed full-time care of the children, ages 5, 7 and 11, moving forward on the adoption process for two of them, with plans to do so for the third, according to his lawyer.\nA friend of both Mattis and Rahman, Salmah Rizvi, recalled him as unfazed by the daunting task of suddenly caring for three children on his own.\n\"He was inspired by this new responsibility and he felt that it really helped him to manage his time,\" she said, adding that he attended all of their parent-teacher conferences. \"He felt it was nothing but a blessing. Never ever did he use the word 'stress.'\"\n'Everything she did was to help underprivileged people'\nRahman cut a similar path. A Pakistani immigrant, she arrived in Brooklyn at age 4 with her mother to meet her father, who was already living in the US. Rahman grew up in Bay Ridge, where she attended public school and then gained entry to Brooklyn Technical High School, a specialized school that is one of the most competitive in New York City. Next came Fordham University.\nIn law school, also at Fordham, she became deeply interested in refugee rights and international human rights, winning a fellowship to work as a lawyer in Turkey, where she helped asylum-seekers in Istanbul, and then did similar work in Cairo for a group called Saint Andrew's Refugee Services, according to her lawyer.\nAs demand for police reform grows, military equipment program faces new scrutiny\nWhen she returned to New York, she got involved in local politics, becoming policy director for a longshot 2017 mayoral campaign by Robert Gangi, an activist and police reform advocate whose central campaign proposal was to eliminate \"broken windows\" policing in New York.\nThe eradication of that practice, which holds that issuing summonses and making arrests for minor offenses helps ward off more serious crimes, was important to Rahman, recalled Bella, one of Gangi's campaign managers.\nBella said Rahman kept their team organized, but rather than being a taskmaster, took on extra work herself if it needed to be done.\n\"I was talking to a few of our colleagues about everything and we were saying, when I forget how to keep going in politics, I think of Urooj. She was the reason why I felt like I could make a difference and my voice mattered,\" Bella said. \"Everything she did was to help underprivileged people.\"\nRahman's professional interests, however, belie the more casual side of a young woman who loves Cardi B, the New York Yankees and Bollywood dancing, her friends said.\nRizvi, the mutual friend of Rahman and Mattis, said Rahman helped choreograph dances for a ceremony the night before Rizvi's wedding, and often assists her in the kitchen.\n\"I like to cook, and she's always willing to cut my onions for me so I don't have to cry.\"\nPrior to her detainment, Rahman had been working for Bronx Legal Services, where she fought evictions for impoverished tenants in housing court, and was responsible for caring for her mother, who is in declining health, doing her grocery shopping and getting her medications.\nAt an early court hearing, a lawyer for Rahman noted that the care she provided for her mother was so extensive that she draws a stipend from a home health care organization.\nNow, however, Rahman may face a bleak outlook. As a prosecutor put it in court: \"She has thrown away her career in the law when she threw that Molotov cocktail at a New York City Police Department vehicle.\"\nSince the protests, video that appears to include an interview with Rahman taken the evening of the alleged incident has surfaced online.\nPosted to YouTube by a group called Loudlabs News NYC, the video shows a woman who gives her name as \"Urooj\" and who wears the same outfit in which Rahman was photographed that evening.\n\"This has got to stop, and the only way they hear us is through violence, through the means that they use,\" she says. \"Gotta use the master's tools, that's what my friend always says.\"\nShe continues: \"What I saw was targeting of property, and no property is above a human life. Destruction of property is nothing compared to the murder of a human life. So I understand why people are doing it. It's a way to show their pain, their anger, because it just never stops.\"\nHer lawyer, Paul Shechtman, said the conduct laid out in the charges, if believed, was \"an aberrant act in the heat of the civil protests that have swept the country over police violence and systemic racism. Viewed in the context of her life, violence is clearly not Ms. Rahman's way.\"\nThough Rahman and Mattis were initially granted bail by a US District Court judge, an appeals court ordered that they be detained while Brooklyn federal prosecutors appeal the bail decision. Since last week, the two have been incarcerated at the Metropolitan Detention Center.\nRahman's lawyer disclosed in a court filing Tuesday arguing against her detention that she is being \"held in isolation (in quarantine) for two weeks,\" adding that \"to believe that Ms. Rahman will turn to violence if released to home detention -- and thereby risk substantial harm to herself and to family and friends -- is to substitute fiction for reason.\"\nIn an unusual step, a group of 56 former federal prosecutors also submitted a proposed brief to the court Tuesday to argue that federal prosecutors in the Rahman and Mattis case have misconstrued the bail laws and that the defendants have been wrongly jailed.\nMeanwhile, their detention has alarmed their friends.\n\"They're just amazing people,\" said Rizvi. \"They're really kind-hearted and they do not deserve to be in jail right now. They are not a threat.\"\nCorrection: A previous version of this story had the incorrect name of the school Mattis attended. He attended St. Andrew's School in Middletown, Delaware."}]
