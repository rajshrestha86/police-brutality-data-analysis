REUTERS/Axel Schmidt\nSocial media users have been sharing an image online that makes several disparaging and false claims about George Soros. Some of these claims include Soros being a former Nazi, Soros \u201cswearing to destroy the U.S.A.\u201d, Soros owning ANTIFA and Black Lives Matter, and Soros paying for protesters. Examples can be seen here and here. \nGeorge Soros is a billionaire philanthropist and founder of Open Society Foundations. He has been the target of multiple conspiracy theories and misinformation on social media (here). Previous Reuters fact checks debunking claims about Soros can be found here and here. \nOpen Society Foundations told Reuters via email that the claims made toward Soros in these posts are \u201cfalse\u201d and \u201cdo a disservice to the very bedrock of our democracy, as enshrined in the First Amendment.\u201d\nSOROS IS NOT A FORMER NAZI\nReuters debunked a false claim that a photograph shows a young Soros in a Nazi uniform (here). During the time Nazis were active, Soros would not have met the age requirements to be in the Schutzstaffel. Soros and his family were Hungarian Jews who lived in Budapest during the war, disguising their identities for safety. In 1947 at the age of 17, Soros moved to London to attend university (more  here). \nBy the time Soros was 17, the fall of Nazi Germany had already happened. Soros could not possibly have been involved in the Nazi party which was active between 1920-1945. He is also a Hungarian Jew, further disproving this theory. In a 1998 60 Minutes interview (youtu.be/AiqHiQYuoOs) Soros says his father forged his family\u2019s identity to protect them. Soros, as a teenager, was placed under custody of a government official with the premise of being his godson. During this time, Soros witnessed (but did not actively participate in) the confiscation of Jewish property (here). In the interview, Soros says he doesn\u2019t feel guilt looking back at these events, mentioning that he was a child at the time and that he was a \u201cspectator\u201d to something that would have happened regardless of his presence.\nSOROS NEVER SWORE TO \u201cDESTROY THE USA\u201d\nReuters found no evidence of Soros ever saying this. Other fact checkers have also debunked this specific \u201cquote\u201d (here, here).\nAn older version of the quote attributes it to a Newsweek interview but there is no evidence Soros said this in their archive. One article quotes Steve Bannon comparing politics to war, saying, \u201cThey fight, look at [George] Soros and these other NGOs...they destroy you.\u201d The article also states that, according to Bannon, Soros threatened to \u201cdestroy him personally.\u201d (here).\nSOROS DOES NOT \u201cOWN\u201d ANTIFA AND BLACK LIVES MATTER\nGeorge Soros does not \u201cown\u201d ANTIFA or Black Lives Matter.\nA spokesperson for Open Society Foundations told Reuters via email: \u201cWe proudly support organizations that promote civic engagement and champion the right of all Americans to petition their government for redress of grievances. Those protesting the death of Mr. Floyd and police brutality across the nation do so out of a deep and abiding concern for country; they don\u2019t do so for pay from these foundations or any other, as some cynics claim.\u201d\nBlack Lives Matter is a largely horizontal, grassroots, global organization (https://\u202fbit.ly/373z22H). Its co-founders, Opal Tometi, Patrisse Cullors, and Alicia Garza started the movement in 2013, after the death of Trayvon Martin. The co-founders recently told the New Yorker that Black Lives Matter \u201chas always been somewhat decentralized\u201d and operates in a horizontal manner: \u201cWe have always said the power goes on in the local chapter because they know what is going on\u201d.\nThe organization recently set up a $12 million grant to help organizations fighting institutional racism, after an upsurge in donations amid the current protests. Beyonc\u00e9 and Prince are among the celebrities who have donated to Black Lives Matter in previous years (here). \nOpen Society Foundations donates to groups worldwide (here). Some of their previous donations - including to Black Lives Matter and Planned Parenthood - have been subject to controversy in the U.S. (here, here). It is unclear if the foundation has donated to Black Lives Matter again in the last month.  \nAntifa, short for \u201canti-fascist,\u201d is an amorphous movement whose adherents oppose people or groups they consider authoritarian or racist, often using aggressive tactics, according to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), which monitors extremists (here). Horizontal in nature and largely lacking official organization, it is unclear how Antifa is funded, if at all (  here  ).\nSOROS DID NOT PAY FOR PROTESTERS AFTER TRUMP\u2019S ELECTION\nFollowing Trump\u2019s 2016 election win, some far-right claims suggested actors including Soros funded the \u2018Not My President\u2019 protests. Open Society Foundations denied paying these protesters in any way (here, here). \nSoros has been mistakenly accused of sponsoring protests after Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s Supreme Court appointment and protests against racism in Ferguson, Missouri (here, here). \nOpen Society Foundations recently explained in a tweet: \u201cWe do not pay protesters. Neither does our founder George Soros. Claims that we do serve to delegitimize those who are exercising their Constitutionally-protected right to protest peacefully and petition their government for redress of grievances.\u201d (here) \nVERDICT\nFalse. Conspiracy theories about George Soros visible in this post are unfounded.\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.

U.S. Attorney's Office in Boston/Handout via Reuters/Files/File Photo\nTsarnaev and his older brother set off a pair of homemade pressure-cooker bombs near the finish line of the world-renowned race, tearing through the packed crowd and causing many people to lose legs.\nA three-judge panel of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld much of Tsarnaev\u2019s conviction but ordered a new trial over what sentence Tsarnaev should receive for the death penalty-eligible crimes he was convicted of.\nU.S. Circuit Judge O. Rogeriee Thompson, writing for the court, said the trial judge \u201cfell short\u201d in conducting the jury selection process and screening jurors for potential bias following pretrial publicity surrounding the high-profile case.\nThompson said the pervasive news coverage of the bombings and their aftermath featured \u201cbone-chilling\u201d photos and videos of Tsarnaev, now 27, and his brother carrying backpacks at the marathon and of those injured and killed near its finish line.\nThompson said the judge deemed jurors eligible who had \u201calready formed an opinion that Dzhokhar was guilty - and he did so in large part because they answered \u2018yes\u2019 to the question whether they could decide this high-profile case based on the evidence.\u201d\nThompson stressed the ruling\u2019s limits. \u201cMake no mistake: Dzhokhar will spend his remaining days locked up in prison, with the only matter remaining being whether he will die by execution,\u201d she said.\nWhile all three judges agreed the death sentence should be overturned, U.S. Circuit Judge Juan Torruella said he believed Tsarnaev was also denied the right to a fair trial when the judge declined to let the case be tried outside of Boston.\nDavid Patton, Tsarnaev\u2019s lawyer, said prosecutors must now decide \u201cwhether to put the victims and Boston through a second trial, or to allow closure to this terrible tragedy by permitting a sentence of life without the possibility of release.\u201d\nU.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling\u2019s spokeswoman said his office is reviewing the decision. Prosecutors could ask the full appeals court to reconsider the ruling or appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.\nSpeaking at an event with law enforcement in Tampa, Florida, President Donald Trump referred to Tsarnaev as an \u201canimal.\u201d\n\u201cThey just sent this conviction for the death penalty back to the lower courts so they\u2019ll argue about that for a long time,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d\nHOUSE-TO-HOUSE MANHUNT\nTsarnaev is being held at the United States\u2019 \u201cSupermax\u201d prison in Florence, Colorado, a site so remote and well secured that it is nicknamed the \u201cAlcatraz of the Rockies.\u201d\nTsarnaev and his older brother Tamerlan sparked five days of panic in Boston on April 15, 2013, when they detonated two homemade pressure cooker bombs at the marathon\u2019s finish line and then went into hiding.\nThree nights later, as they attempted to flee the city, they sparked a new round of terror in Boston when they hijacked a car and shot dead Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer Sean Collier. Tsarnaev\u2019s brother died later that night after a gunfight with police, which ended when Dzhokhar ran him over with a stolen car.\nPolice then locked down Boston and most surrounding communities for almost 24 hours, with heavily armed officers conducting house-to-house searches through the suburb of Watertown, where the surviving brother was found hiding in a dry-docked boat in a backyard.\nA jury in 2015 found Tsarnaev guilty of all 30 counts he faced and later determined he deserved execution for a bomb he planted that killed 8-year-old Martin Richard and 23-year-old Chinese exchange student Lingzi Lu. Restaurant manager Krystle Campbell, 29, was also killed.\nBill and Denise Richard, whose son Martin was the youngest fatality in the attack, in a statement printed on the front page of the Boston Globe in 2015 had asked the U.S. Department of Justice to drop its pursuit of the death penalty, saying it would only prolong their pain.\nOn the day of his sentencing, Tsarnaev admitted his crimes.\n\u201cI am sorry for the lives I have taken, for the suffering that I have caused you, for the damage I have done, irreparable damage,\u201d said Tsarnaev. \u201cIn case there is any doubt, I am guilty of this attack, along with my brother.\u201d\nReporting by Nate Raymond; Editing by Scott Malone, Leslie Adler, Jonathan Oatis and Daniel Wallis\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"url": "/article/idUSKCN24W2QD", "headline": "In Portland, some Black activists frustrated with white protesters", "published_date": "2020-07-31", "text": "By Deborah Bloom\n4 MIN READ\nPORTLAND (Reuters) - A small group of Black teenage girls carrying megaphones stood in front of the federal courthouse in downtown Portland near midnight on Thursday facing a largely white band of protesters.\nA protester walks through tear gas deployed by federal law enforcement officers during a demonstration against police violence and racial inequality in Portland, Oregon, U.S., July 29, 2020.

Florida is among at least 18 states that saw cases more than double in July, when almost 25,000 people in the United States died of COVID-19.\n\u201cI definitely don\u2019t feel safe.

She rarely ventures outside except to walk her dog but recently went on a drive to the beach.\n\u201cThere were people there walking around without masks, even though they mandated masks and there are police officers giving fines,\u201d Santiago told Reuters. \u201cFlorida is in a really bad position right now.\u201d\nAdding to the state\u2019s woes, a hurricane was bearing down on Florida\u2019s Atlantic coast.\nGovernor Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency for counties on that coast with Hurricane Isaias expected to hit as early as Friday night, a development that prompted the widespread closure of COVID-19 testing sites.\nNationally, coronavirus deaths are rising at their fastest rate since early June and one person in the United States died about every minute from COVID-19 on Wednesday, the day with the largest increase in deaths so far this week.\nFAUCI ON THE SPOT\nIn Washington, Anthony Fauci, the main infectious diseases expert at the National Institutes of Health, evaded efforts by a staunch ally of President Donald Trump to have him criticize holding protests about racial injustice during the pandemic.\nFauci clashed with Representative Jim Jordan at a hearing of the U.S. House of Representatives Subcommittee on the Coronavirus after the Ohio Republican asked him whether protests should be curbed or eliminated to control the coronavirus.\n\u201cShould we limit the protesting?\u201d Jordan asked. When Fauci said he was not in a position to make such a recommendation, the lawmaker retorted: \u201cYou make all kinds of recommendations. You make comments on dating, on baseball and everything you could imagine.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not favoring anybody over anybody,\u201d Fauci replied. \u201cI\u2019m not going to opine on limiting anything ... I\u2019m telling you what is the danger, and you can make your own conclusion about that. You should stay away from crowds, no matter where the crowds are.\u201d\nFauci also fended off attempts by Democrats to have him criticize the current state of COVID-19 testing.\nHe repeatedly handed off Democratic lawmakers\u2019 questions about testing to witnesses more directly involved with that effort. Fauci made headlines in March by describing U.S. testing efforts as failing.\nTrump, who appeared to be watching the hearing, weighed in on Twitter against his Democratic critics: \u201cOur massive testing capability, rather than being praised, is used by the Lamestream Media and their partner, the Do Nothing Radical Left Democrats, as a point of scorn. This testing, and what we have so quickly done, is used as a Fake News weapon. Sad!\u201d\nThe COVID-19 epicenter in the United States has shown signs of shifting to the Midwest after ravaging New York and Sunbelt states.\nOn Friday, a travel order in Chicago went into effect requiring people who visited or are coming from neighboring Wisconsin to quarantine for 14 days. Wisconsin joined 21 other states that have seen a surge in new cases and been placed on Chicago\u2019s travel quarantine list.\nAllison Arwady, commissioner of the Chicago Department of Public Health, said in a Twitter video that commuters are exempt but must limit their activities, avoid public spaces and wear a face mask. If people violate the order they face fines of up to $500 per day, the city said.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak \u201cis not in good control\u201d in Wisconsin, she said.\nIllinois Governor JB Pritzker warned that if coronavirus numbers get worse, bars may have to close in some places, according to media reports.\nDr. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, said on Thursday that Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, Missouri, Kansas and Nebraska were particularly at risk \u201cbecause of vacations and other reasons of travel.\u201d (Reporting by Lisa Shumaker and Brendan O\u2019Brien in Chicago, Maria Caspani in New York and David Morgan in Washington; Writing by Alistair Bell; Editing by Daniel Wallis)\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"url": "/article/idUSL3N2F11UQ", "headline": "In Portland, some Black activists frustrated with white protesters", "published_date": "2020-07-31", "text": "By Deborah Bloom\n4 MIN READ\nPORTLAND (Reuters) - A small group of Black teenage girls carrying megaphones stood in front of the federal courthouse in downtown Portland near midnight on Thursday facing a largely white band of protesters.\nA protester walks through tear gas deployed by federal law enforcement officers during a demonstration against police violence and racial inequality in Portland, Oregon, U.S., July 29, 2020.

Or do they scale back on work, or even quit, threatening their financial stability?\nThe barriers risk stalling or reversing the economic gains of recent years made by working women, who are more likely to take a career hit than men when they are unable to find child care, studies show.\nA survey here by Northeastern University between May 10-June 22 found that 13% of working parents had to resign or reduce their work hours because of a lack of child care during the health crisis, with women impacted significantly more than men. In all, of those who said they had lost a job due to child care problems, 60% were women, the survey found.\n\u201cIf women don\u2019t have child care, they can\u2019t go back to work,\u201d said Karen Schulman, Child Care and Early Learning Research Director for the National Women\u2019s Law Center. If that doesn\u2019t happen, \u201cyou end up creating a system that is going to result in vast gender inequities\u201d.\nPrior to the pandemic, the labor force participation rate for women aged 25-54 touched 77% in February, rising from 73% in September 2015 and close to the peak reached in 2000, when the share of women in the labor force began to plateau, in part because of challenges accessing affordable child care, experts say.\nLIMITED OPTIONS\nPressure looks certain to mount on families in the coming weeks, as various aid programs and protections that offered relief to jobless parents expire, including enhanced unemployment benefits, eviction moratoriums and a freeze on student loan payments.\n\u201cThere\u2019s this fragile, invisible thread holding the lives of our moms, holding the lives of our economy together,\u201d said Chastity Lord, president and chief executive of the Jeremiah Program, a Minneapolis-based nonprofit organization that supports single mothers and their children.\nSlideshow ( 4 images )\nFinding a way to broaden access to child care will be pivotal to helping the U.S. labor market heal from the economic devastation caused by the pandemic, with latest data showing the economy contracting an annualized 32.9% in the second quarter of 2020 and approximately one out of five workers claiming unemployment insurance in the week ending July 11.\nChild care was already scarce before the coronavirus led to the shuttering of thousands of centers. More than half of all Americans lived in a child care \u201cdesert\u201d as of 2018, defined by the Center for American Progress, a liberal nonprofit group in Washington, as an area with no licensed child care providers or less than one slot for every three children under five.\nNow, in many states, care centers accept only limited numbers of children to prevent the virus from spreading. Additionally, families that relied on grandparents or other older relatives or neighbors must weigh up the risks of asking for their help again and perhaps exposing them to a disease that has proved especially deadly for the elderly.\nChantel Springer, 24, worked at Starbucks in Manhattan during the early months of the pandemic but has been on furlough since June, when the store cut back on staff to adjust to lower demand and social distancing requirements. Now that her unemployment benefits could shrink as low as $325 a week, Springer is making arrangements to get back to her job as a shift manager.\n\u201cI feel like I have to work,\u201d said Springer, explaining that the reduced benefits would not be enough to cover the rent, food, diapers and other costs.\nThis month, Springer transferred to a store in Brooklyn so she could be closer to her apartment and her two-year-old. But finding someone to babysit her son is a challenge. Springer can no longer leave the toddler with her mother, who recently moved to take care of a disabled sister whose husband died from Covid-19. For now, she is looking to coordinate schedules with her son\u2019s father, who has also returned to work at a retail store.\nHOME ALONE\nUnder the CARES Act passed in late March, parents who lost access to child care because of the pandemic became eligible for unemployment benefits. But the process of qualifying for the program, which varies from state to state, became less clear cut as the school year ended and some day care centers began to re-open with limited capacity.\nThe Labor Department sought to clarify with guidance that parents should resort to their typical summer child care plans.\nMany states, including New York, Missouri and Louisiana, allow parents to self-certify each week, under penalty of perjury, that their child care center was closed and that they met the requirements to continue receiving benefits. Other states, like California and Texas, make such decisions on a \u201ccase-by-case\u201d basis.\nWhile child care places are hard to find for toddlers, they are even scarcer for school-age children and many summer programs for this age-group went online, leaving parents facing a quandary.\nSarah Sapp is hatching plans to rig up an old cell phone for her 11-year-old son, Avery.\nThe 37-year-old waitress from North Olmsted, a western suburb of Cleveland, fears her son, who sometimes struggles to pay attention to instructions, isn\u2019t quite mature enough to be left home alone while she serves food and drinks at a high-end tavern. But she feels she has little choice.\nWhen Ohio initially ordered restaurants and bars to close in March, Sapp qualified for state unemployment. But when the state told people it was safe to return to work in May, she was informed that she would no longer be eligible. Sapp tried to sign her son up for a day camp at her local recreation center but it got canceled.\nMore problems are piling up on the horizon. Sapp\u2019s school district has told parents they must choose between all online lessons or a hybrid of two days shortened days in school and three days at home when classes resume in September. Neither of these options would allow her to work her lunchtime shift.\n\u201cI feel stuck,\u201d Sapp said. \u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to be a right choice no matter how I look at things.\u201d\nRachel Dissell is a contributing reporter with The Fuller Project, a global nonprofit newsroom reporting on issues that impact women.; Jonnelle Marte reported for this story from New York; Editing by Heather Timmons and Crispian Balmer\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"url": "/article/idUSKCN24V3RM", "headline": "NBA players protest racial injustice as league returns to action", "published_date": "2020-07-31", "text": "By Rory Carroll\n3 MIN READ\n(Reuters) - NBA teams bowed their heads and knelt during the playing of the U.S. national anthem while wearing Black Lives Matter T-shirts on Thursday as the league returned for the first time since the coronavirus halted play in March with two thrilling games.\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\nCoaches and game officials joined players from the Utah Jazz, New Orleans Pelicans and Los Angeles Lakers and Clippers in taking a knee to protest against racial injustice and police brutality in the first games in 140 days.\nBlack Lives Matter was also written on the courts at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex in the Walt Disney World Resort near Orlando, where the NBA plans to finish its season with 22 teams inside a bio-secure bubble.\n\u201cThe game of basketball has always been bigger than just the ball, the rim, 10 guys on the floor and referees,\u201d the Lakers LeBron James said after hitting the game-winning shot in his team\u2019s 103-101 win over the Clippers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to use this platform to spread a lot of positivity and love throughout the whole world.\u201d\nHe said that while there has been progress in the fight against systemic racism, the key was to maintain the momentum.\n\u201cWe want to keep our foot on the gas,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with a lot of racism, a lot of social injustice and a lot of police brutality, not only in my neighborhood and not only with Black people, but with all people of color.\u201d\nRELATED COVERAGE\nNBA re-evaluating training programme in China after abuse allegations\nSome players had messages like \u201cEquality,\u201d \u201cEducation Reform\u201d and \u201cSay Their Names\u201d on the backs of their jerseys in place of their names.\nAthletes from around the world have united behind anti-racism protests sparked by the death of George Floyd, a Black man in police custody in Minneapolis in May.\nIn the first game, the Jazz came from behind to defeat the Pelicans 106-104 after the Pelicans\u2019 Brandon Ingram\u2019s three-pointer at the buzzer rimmed out.\nThe games are being played without fans, but \u201cvirtual fans\u201d appeared on LED screens wrapped around the court and a simulation of a crowd\u2019s cheers and jeers could be heard.\nReporting by Rory Carroll in Los Angeles; Editing by Ed Osmond and William Mallard\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"url": "/article/idUSKCN24W0BU", "headline": "NBA notebook: Players, coaches kneel as games return", "published_date": "2020-07-30", "text": "By Reuters Staff\n3 MIN READ\nEvery person present at HP Fieldhouse on the ESPN Wide World of Sports campus near Orlando knelt during the national anthem before the first game of the NBA\u2019s restarted season on Thursday night.\nJuly 30, 2020; Lake Buena Vista, USA; Members of the New Orleans Pelicans and Utah Jazz kneel together around the Black Lives Matter logo on the court during the national anthem before the start of an NBA basketball game.

MORGAN ASSET MANAGEMENT, LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM\n\u201cToday\u2019s US GDP release confirmed that the Covid-19 crisis brought about the fastest decline in US activity since the Great Depression, but to markets and investors this is now old news.\n\u201cThe important question is how quickly will the economy recover? While we believe the worst is certainly behind us we think the path ahead will be bumpy as the economy battles to re-open without leading to a reacceleration in infections. The most recent high frequency data show the difficulty in achieving that balance - the pace of the recovery appears to have slowed in July as consumers are cautious of going out and spending amid high infection levels. Eighteen million Americans are still out of work and the enhanced unemployment benefits are due to run out tomorrow.\n\u201cWith the economy far from ready to stand on its own two feet, it is vital that Congress approves a new support package in the coming days if the recovery is to be sustained.\u201d\nELLIS PHIFER, MARKET STRATEGIST, RAYMOND JAMES, MEMPHIS\n\u201cI call it a cartoonishly large number and that\u2019s what we got.\u201d\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s looking to all the positives we had and some of the growth that we\u2019ve seen and some of the better-than-expected numbers that we\u2019ve seen since, but then again we\u2019re looking at the potential for more slowing.\u201d\n\u201cEverybody expected these wild crazy numbers and we\u2019re getting them and the (Treasury) market is kind of focused on \u2018ok are we going to move ahead?\u2019\u201d\nMICHAEL O\u2019ROURKE, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST AT JONESTRADING IN STAMFORD, CONNECTICUT\n\u201cThe GDP number is not really a surprise. It\u2019s been expected for some time. At this point its old news. It\u2019s a horrible number but the quarter ended a month ago. Everybody lived it and experienced it. It\u2019s a backward looking number.\u201d\n\u201cThe more important number is probably that initial jobless claims increased for the second week in a row for the first time since March.\u201d\n\u201cThe market first was down 1% because futures sold off in Europe overnight. That\u2019s why we were initially down. The increase in claims just reinforces the fact that the economic recovery has leveled out,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cwe could be rolling over again as we shut down more states and roll back the reopening.\u201d\nJACK ABLIN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER AT CRESSET CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, CHICAGO\n\u201cThe economy declined by more than 32% on an annualized basis and that was better than expected, so you can take it as incrementally good news. This is an environment where I track a lot of high-frequency data nowadays, I\u2019m watching the New York Fed high-frequency economic data, I watch COVID cases, I\u2019m watching OpenTable and claims. This is probably the only period in my career where the Thursday weekly unemployment claims carries more weight than the previous quarter\u2019s GDP number.\n\u201cOne thing I can take comfort in is economists did have it pretty close to correct, they were able to gather a lot of chaotic data and assemble it in a way, at least for the quarter, seemed to be about right. I just have to laugh when I saw the number and said, \u2018hey that is better than expected, that is going to be taken as good news.\u2019\u201d\nRANDY FREDERICK, VICE PRESIDENT, TRADING AND DERIVATIVES, CHARLES SCHWAB, AUSTIN, TEXAS\n\u201cWhen you get to numbers that are that big, the amount that you\u2019re off by two percentage points is really not that much. The fact that it was better than expected maybe is a good thing, but certainly not much better, and it\u2019s still a terrible number.\u201d\n\u201cThe jobless claims numbers were very close to expectations. But it was the second weekly uptick, which I think is significant, because that really means that the initial claims have leveled off.\u201d\n\u201cSo each week 1.4 million or so new people are looking for unemployment assistance and that\u2019s a huge number. It certainly is not a good sign because it\u2019s not continuing to decline.\u201d\nMARC CHANDLER, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, BANNOCKBURN GLOBAL FOREX, NEW YORK\n\u201cI\u2019m kind of surprised that there\u2019s been such a mild dollar reaction. The dollar has basically bounced post Fed, but the bounce is relatively mild.\u201d\n\u201cI think that the GDP number is really old news in the sense that everybody knew that it going to be horrible. And the exact number on horrible, I\u2019m not sure how much that matters. Instead I was surprised that there was such a little reaction to the jobless claims second weekly increase, and the continuing claims rose for the first time in a week. This has made the U.S. yields basically at record lows, the two-year, the five-year and the 10-year are all near record lows. So I think this is going to keep the dollar under pressure, but we\u2019ve really seen a really mild reaction.\u201d\nRUSSELL PRICE, CHIEF ECONOMIST, AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL SERVICES INC, TROY, MICHIGAN\n\u201cThe market probably is reacting to the claims number more than the GDP report. Futures already were down before these reports. The GDP numbers were already largely expected to be very, very bad. But the market was already viewing this report in the review mirror, and quite frankly, good riddance.\n\u201cMost of the (GDP) numbers that I\u2019m looking at were generally in line with expectations. But it provides a low bar for growth in the second half of the year. What the market is responding to is the fact that new claims for unemployment ticked up for the second straight week, and continuing claims remain very, very high as well.\n\u201cGDP was horrible, but it was fractionally less horrible than expected. The claims report is what\u2019s more worrisome because it shows that the recovery that had been showing strong numbers from early on in May and June has now stalled and maybe even reversed a little bit because of the surge in new COVID-19 cases.\u201d\nERIK BREGAR, HEAD OF FX STRATEGY, EXCHANGE BANK OF CANADA, TORONTO\n\u201cThe GDP number is not surprising and I don\u2019t really think markets care. This is old news. But my gut feeling is that there is no V-shaped recovery coming. A quick look at the bond market today tells you that things are going to get worse, not better.\nGerman Bunds are trading at two month lows. U.S. 10-year yields are also trading lower. If the bond market and the banks which are huge participants in that market bond believe that they are going to see a V-shaped recovery, then yields would be trading much, much higher.\u201d\nPETER CARDILLO, CHIEF MARKET ECONOMIST, SPARTAN CAPITAL SECURITIES, NEW YORK\n\u201c(GDP) came in close to consensus, but obviously it\u2019s a historic decline. And if you look at consumer spending, it was off 34.6% and PCE prices were down 1.9%. These are historic numbers.\u201d\n\u201cOf course this is old news, but what does it mean going forward? The numbers so bad that while recovery is on the way, the new impact of coronavirus cases could stall the recovery.\u201d\n\u201cBut this was baked into the market. We had a warning from the Fed yesterday that the economy will depend on the course of the virus. With that in mind with the new cases it will be an even slower recovery that we anticipated.\u201d\n\u201cWe also saw jobless claims rise and that \u2018s probably even more of a problem.

That it is not fair,\u201d Washington told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nDubbed the \u201cQueen of Urban Farming\u201d, Washington co-founded Black Urban Growers, an organisation supporting farmers working in urban and rural settings, and also started Rise & Root Farm.\nGreenhouses and rows of crops and flowers stretch across the women-led market garden in Chester, New York, which supplies organic vegetables, herbs and bouquets to buyers in the city.\nPotted seedlings are on sale too for beginners wanting to turn their balconies or yards into vegetable patches.\n\u2018BAD FOOD, LACK OF FOOD\u2019\nWhile the struggle for \u201cfood justice\u201d is decades-old, the coronavirus pandemic has exposed how racial inequalities still make it harder for many Black Americans to eat well, affecting their health and ultimately cutting some lives short.\nPreliminary data from several states has shown that COVID-19 is killing African Americans at a higher rate.\nHuman rights campaigners say that likely reflects both poorer underlying health with Black Americans more likely to have heart disease, diabetes and high blood pressure as well as reduced access to healthcare.\n\u201cThe bad food, the lack of food, the health disparities, the life expectancy, the incarceration rates, the violence, all of those pieces are all connected to the economic system and who has power,\u201d said Erika Allen, co-founder and chief executive at the Chicago-based Urban Growers Collective.\nBut food production has not always been an almost exclusively white endeavour in the United States.\nIn 2017, 95% of the country\u2019s nearly 3.4 million farmers were white, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) census released last year.\nBlack farmers accounted for 1.3% or 45,508, compared to the 1920s when their numbers peaked at 925,708.\nPeople of color hold 3% of the country\u2019s agricultural land, according to a 2014 government survey on tenure and ownership.\nLeah Penniman, co-director of Soul Fire Farm, an urban growing collective based in Petersburg, New York, said the fall in the number of Black farmers reflected decades of discrimination and a backlash over an estimated 16 million acres (6.5 million hectares) of land they owned in 1910.\n\u201cRacism and white supremacy are really built into the DNA of the U.S. food system,\u201d said Penniman, author of a book called \u201cFarming While Black\u201d.\nShe said the same thinking that justified the theft of indigenous lands and the use of slaves as farm labour morphed over decades into new forms of racial discrimination in the country\u2019s food production chain.\nThousands of Black farmers who said they were racially discriminated against for decades by the USDA won $1.25 billion in a court settlement in 2010. A separate $760 million in compensation for American Indian farmers was also announced.\nZIP CODE LOTTERY\nBringing to mind scorched, barren terrain far from towns and cities, the USDA uses the term \u201cfood desert\u201d to describe areas with limited supplies of fresh, affordable foods.\nIt is a term rejected by community farming activists who say the lack of food available in these poverty-afflicted areas is a reflection of discrimination rather than unfavourable geography.\nAn estimated 54.4 million Americans - 17.7% of the population - live in \u201cfood deserts\u201d, according to the USDA.\nNot everyone living in \u201cfood deserts\u201d is Black, but studies have shown that even when poverty levels are similar, Black neighborhoods have fewer supermarkets than other areas.\nPenniman, who opened Soul Fire Farm in 2010, lived in a \u201cfood desert\u201d in the south of Albany, New York, recalling how hard it was to find fruit and vegetables for her young family as they did not own a car and there was no bus service.\nThe only option was to buy a subscription from a local farm about two miles (three kms) away through a community-supported agriculture (CSA) program. It cost more than the family\u2019s rent.\nThat spurred Penniman and her husband to set up a community garden that now offers low-cost doorstep delivery of fruits and vegetables to residents of the Albany-Troy area and runs training programs on how to farm.\n\u201cIn this country, your zip code is a very high predictor of your life expectancy,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a concentration of hunger and diet-related illness in certain zip codes that correlates with where Black and brown communities live.\u201d\nOther grassroots initiatives challenging the agricultural status quo are happening in other parts of the country, even as the pandemic forces the suspension of services such as farmers markets and on-site training courses.\nIn Chicago, Allen\u2019s Urban Growers Collective, which uses converted city buses as mobile markets for farm produce, plans to start work on a facility to turn food waste into compost.\nCritically acclaimed Burmese restaurant Thamee in Washington D.C. has teamed up with non-profit Dreaming Out Loud to offer customers a selection of products sourced from Black farmers.\nThe restaurant is also selling pantry items produced by Black, Indigenous and people of color, said co-owner Simone Jacobson.\nWashington hopes that changes stemming from the coronavirus and Black Lives Matter movement could prove a watershed in her fight to uproot \u201cfood apartheid\u201d for good.\nBut she said structural changes were needed as opposed to businesses paying lip service to equality by making one-off donations to charity programmes or other PR-friendly gestures.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t go on controlling a food system and say systemic change is going to take place ... Move on and let somebody else take the leadership position,\u201d she said.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t always say, \u2018I\u2019m waiting for you to get ready.\u2019 We\u2019ve been ready for 400 years.\u201d\nReporting by Thin Lei Win, Editing by Helen Popper and Belinda Goldsmith Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers the lives of people around the world who struggle to live freely or fairly.

The constitution now will allow Putin to return to power for another two six-year terms. Independent monitor Golos, however, reported unprecedented vote fraud, and political opponents say the elaborate maneuvering over the ballot has weakened Putin\u2019s legitimacy. Public discontent over Putin\u2019s rule has begun to spill into the open in Russia\u2019s Far East, where tens of thousands have marched in protest for the past three weekends.\nBeyond Putin\u2019s own comments to state TV, the Kremlin isn\u2019t explaining its calculus about the constitutional change. But a first-hand account by a former insider of how the Kremlin tried to manage the handover of power in 2008, when Putin first faced a constitutional limit on his presidency, provides a glimpse into the under-the-carpet power struggles of Moscow\u2019s ruling elite and some of the issues the Russian leader must grapple with.\nPugachev entertaining Igor Sechin, then deputy chief of staff, and Nikolai Patrushev, then head of the Federal Security Service, both to his right hand, at his dacha in 2005.\nSince at least 2006, former Kremlin adviser Sergei Pugachev told Reuters, Putin has been grappling with the question of succession. Once known as the Kremlin\u2019s banker, Pugachev played a key role in Putin\u2019s rise 20 years ago. His business interests spanned military shipyards, coal and construction, and he sat as a senator in parliament\u2019s upper chamber. Today he is in deep conflict with his former allies, accused by Russian authorities of bankrupting the bank he co-founded, a charge Pugachev denies. He left Russia, ending up in Britain and then France, where he currently lives, after London\u2019s High Court in 2014 ordered his assets frozen at Russia\u2019s request.\nNow, Pugachev has spoken for the first time about Putin\u2019s decision-making in the run-up to 2008. He told how the president was often hostage to the will of his inner circle of former KGB men and associates from his hometown of St Petersburg.\nThe question of handing over power has always been the \u201cbiggest headache\u201d of Putin\u2019s rule, Pugachev told Reuters. For Putin, the succession \u201cwas always a serious, personal stress. He never intended to hand over control of the country to anyone.\u201d Putin saw himself running Russia behind the scenes as the father of the nation, said Pugachev, but finding a successor who would go along with this plan \u201cwas always a big problem.\u201d\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to comment about Pugachev\u2019s account of events.\nIn 2007, Pugachev was still a consummate Kremlin insider, close to many of the powerful men around Putin, the so-called siloviki, mostly drawn from Russia\u2019s security services. He says he was in the room when several key decisions were made.

These included Nikolai Patrushev, then the head of the Federal Security Service, or FSB, successor to the KGB; and Igor Sechin, one of Putin\u2019s KGB allies from St Petersburg, who at the time of the photo was deputy head of the Kremlin administration.\nA LOOMING DEADLINE\nThe first time Putin considered changing laws to prolong his rule was in the second term of his presidency, Pugachev said.\nBy the summer of 2007, Sergei Ivanov, Putin\u2019s first deputy prime minister and the youngest ever general in Russia\u2019s foreign intelligence service, was widely considered the frontrunner to become president the following year, ahead of another Putin ally, Dmitry Medvedev. The constitution dictated that Putin should step down in 2008 upon expiry of his second consecutive term.\nMembers of Putin\u2019s inner circle feared that if Ivanov got the top job, he would cut them out of power. They began briefing Putin against Ivanov, said Pugachev. \u201cThey began telling Putin that Ivanov is very dangerous. He is very aggressive. He will take power and then you will never be able to get rid of him. They were collecting all kinds of kompromat (compromising information) on Ivanov. Almost everyone was against him.\u201d\nKremlin spokesperson Peskov said Ivanov, now the president\u2019s special representative for nature, ecology and transport, would not be able to comment. Reuters couldn\u2019t reach him directly.\nPugachev too had fallen out with Ivanov, after failing to win a major shipbuilding contract in 2006, when Ivanov was the defence minister. That Ivanov seemed to be a loner only boosted him in Putin\u2019s eyes, according to Pugachev. It meant Ivanov \u201ccouldn\u2019t coordinate with anyone against Putin.\u201d\nBehind the scenes, another option to extend Putin\u2019s hold on power was also under consideration. Pugachev said that, at Putin\u2019s request, Pugachev directed a group of lawyers headed by a co-author of the Russian constitution, Sergei Shakhrai, to look into ways Putin could run for a third term. The lawyers proposed enabling Putin to run again through a two-thirds majority vote in parliament. Putin had consistently opposed changing the constitution but, said Pugachev, he wanted \u201ca second option just in case.\u201d Shakhrai declined to comment.\nSlideshow ( 4 images )\nIvanov\u2019s candidacy ended in August 2007, according to Pugachev. Putin had just announced the restoration of long-haul military flights capable of reaching American shores for the first time in 15 years, a move hailed by Russian newspapers as a demonstration of Moscow\u2019s restored military might.\nSix days after Putin\u2019s triumphant announcement, Ivanov said in a television interview the flights did not signify a return to the Cold War. By appearing to speak for the Kremlin, he had overstepped the mark.\n\u201cSechin brought a tape of Ivanov\u2019s interview to Putin,\u201d Pugachev said, describing a meeting between Pugachev, Putin and Sechin. Sechin, according to Pugachev, told the president: \u201c\u2018Look, Vladimir Vladimirovich, you launched the bombers which have not flown for 15 years, since before the Soviet collapse. And Sergei Ivanov, who is no one \u2013 he isn\u2019t even the president yet, he isn\u2019t even the successor yet \u2013 he has already claimed [the project] as his own.\u201d\n\u201cSechin played on his ego,\u201d Pugachev continued. \u201cPutin has a thing about going down in history. This was his story, and Ivanov entered his territory\u2026. It was an important psychological moment.\u201d\nA spokesman for Sechin declined to comment. Kremlin spokesman Peskov said he could not comment since he was not present.\nPutin wanted a successor who would be president in name only and ready to make way at any moment, Pugachev said. After this incident, added Pugachev, the door was closed to Ivanov.\nBut time had run out to amend the rules so that Putin could run for a third term. The presidential election was to be announced by the end of 2007, with the vote itself in March 2008. By law, any legal change allowing Putin to remain in power had to happen at least six months prior to an election being called. Putin \u201cslept through\u201d the opportunity for a third term, Pugachev said.\nInstead, in September 2007, Putin announced he was appointing as prime minister Viktor Zubkov, a little-known former state farm director who at the time was head of Russia\u2019s anti-money laundering watchdog. The 66-year-old Zubkov was suddenly in the frame to succeed Putin.\nPugachev said Putin was weighing making Zubkov president for one year, after which Zubkov could say he had fallen ill, and Putin could return. \u201cI discussed this with him personally. With Putin and with Zubkov,\u201d Pugachev said. But Putin rejected the idea. \u201cHe told me it wouldn\u2019t look very good.\u201d\nReuters couldn\u2019t reach Zubkov. Kremlin spokesman Peskov declined to comment on the matter.\nFinally, on December 10, just as the election was about to be declared, Putin announced Dmitry Medvedev, a St Petersburg lawyer who\u2019d long worked in Putin\u2019s shadow, was his favoured candidate to take over as president. Pugachev said Putin\u2019s circle believed that Medvedev, who\u2019d served as Kremlin chief of staff and most recently alongside Ivanov as a first deputy prime minister, would be the most malleable successor and, importantly, the most willing to make way for Putin should Putin decide to return to the presidency. Similar views of the Putin-Medvedev partnership were widely reported in Russia at the time.\nAlexander and Viktor Pugachev with Putin\u2019s daughters, Maria and Katerina, in the Kremlin library circa 2004.\nA TIME OF CONFUSION\nFor the next four years of Medvedev\u2019s presidency, it was as if there were one and a half presidents, Pugachev said. While Putin served as prime minister to Medvedev\u2019s president, many within Russia\u2019s elite were confused about who had the final say.\n\u201cFirst people ran to Medvedev, and then they ran to Putin. People didn\u2019t understand. If you did something Putin gave you the go ahead to do, the next day Medvedev could reproach you,\u201d Pugachev said, citing the example of one Russian state bank boss who, when arranging financing, first sought Putin\u2019s approval and then went to Medvedev for his. \u201cFor people it\u2019s unacceptable when there are two presidents, or one and a half. It\u2019s very important for them to understand who the Tsar is.\u201d\nPutin might have been happy to allow Medvedev to serve as president for a second term, but Putin\u2019s inner circle could not contemplate the prospect, Pugachev said, because they feared losing their hold over the economy. A \u201cvicious war\u201d broke out between factions as Medvedev, in anticipation of running for a second term, began positioning his allies to take over greater chunks of the economy, including Gazprom and Rosneft, the state energy giants long run by Putin\u2019s closest cohort, including Sechin.\nThe U.S. administration\u2019s open courtship of Medvedev over Putin further exacerbated the rift.\nMedvedev\u2019s hopes for a second term were quashed at the very last minute, said Pugachev. By now, Pugachev had already fled Russia, but he said he continued to have in-depth conversations with one of Medvedev\u2019s closest allies about what was happening.\nAccording to this account, Medvedev was in the Kremlin putting the finishing touches to his anticipated announcement that he would run for a second term, to be delivered the next day, Sept. 24, 2011, at the annual congress of the ruling United Russia party. In the small hours of the morning, Putin\u2019s security men quietly swapped out the most loyal members of Medvedev\u2019s presidential guard.\nThe switching of the guards was a threatening sign, according to Pugachev. He recounted that soon afterwards Putin arrived at Medvedev\u2019s Kremlin office and the two men had a friendly chat. Later, Putin announced he was seeking the presidency for himself. \u201cIn the end it didn\u2019t really matter how much pressure Putin\u2019s security men put on Medvedev [to stand aside]. In the end it was a question of personal contact between Putin and Medvedev,\u201d said Pugachev.\nKremlin spokesman Peskov said he could not comment on the veracity of Pugachev\u2019s account. He said he only heard of Putin\u2019s plans to return as president when it was publicly announced at the United Russia congress. \u201cI worked alongside Putin. But he did not share his plans,\u201d Peskov said.\nMedvedev could not be reached for comment.\nA political consultant who\u2019d previously worked for Medvedev, Gleb Pavlovsky, said at the time that it looked like Medvedev had stepped down under pressure. He pointed out that only three months earlier, in an interview with the Financial Times, Medvedev had made clear he would seek a second term as president.\nBut while the 2008-2012 experiment with Medvedev\u2019s presidency had revealed to Putin\u2019s circle the risks of a handover of power, Pugachev said he believes Putin might still be considering standing aside again. The recent constitutional vote may give Putin time to resolve a succession plan behind the scenes, without the pressure of the clock ticking on his final term, Pugachev said.\nA sign that Putin may be keeping his options open, Pugachev said, is that a little-noticed change formalises into the constitution a law granting former presidents immunity from prosecution.\nIf Putin were to pick a successor, it would be imperative this person be a member of his trusted inner circle, Pugachev said. \u201cPutin can\u2019t stand outsiders. It\u2019s either his people or no one. It could be his driver or his bodyguard. The successor has to be his.\u201d\nreporting by Catherine Belton; edited by Janet McBride\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"url": "/article/idUSKCN24T1HL", "headline": "Special Report: Rite Aid deployed facial recognition systems in hundreds of U.S. stores", "published_date": "2020-07-28", "text": "By Jeffrey Dastin\n25 MIN READ\n(Reuters) - Over about eight years, the American drugstore chain Rite Aid Corp RAD.N quietly added facial recognition systems to 200 stores across the United States, in one of the largest rollouts of such technology among retailers in the country, a Reuters investigation found.\n In the hearts of New York and metro Los Angeles, Rite Aid deployed the technology in largely lower-income, non-white neighborhoods, according to a Reuters analysis. And for more than a year, the retailer used state-of-the-art facial recognition technology from a company with links to China and its authoritarian government.\nIn telephone and email exchanges with Reuters since February, Rite Aid confirmed the existence and breadth of its facial recognition program. The retailer defended the technology\u2019s use, saying it had nothing to do with race and was intended to deter theft and protect staff and customers from violence. Reuters found no evidence that Rite Aid\u2019s data was sent to China.\nLast week, however, after Reuters sent its findings to the retailer, Rite Aid said it had quit using its facial recognition software. It later said all the cameras had been turned off.\n\u201cThis decision was in part based on a larger industry conversation,\u201d the company told Reuters in a statement, adding that \u201cother large technology companies seem to be scaling back or rethinking their efforts around facial recognition given increasing uncertainty around the technology\u2019s utility.\u201d\nReuters pieced together how the company\u2019s initiative evolved, how the software has been used and how a recent vendor was linked to China, drawing on thousands of pages of internal documents from Rite Aid and its suppliers, as well as direct observations during store visits by Reuters journalists and interviews with more than 40 people familiar with the systems\u2019 deployment. Most current and former employees spoke on condition of anonymity, saying they feared jeopardizing their careers.\nWhile Rite Aid declined to disclose which locations used the technology, Reuters found facial recognition cameras at 33 of the 75 Rite Aid shops in Manhattan and the central Los Angeles metropolitan area during one or more visits from October through July.\nThe cameras were easily recognizable, hanging from the ceiling on poles near store entrances and in cosmetics aisles. Most were about half a foot long, rectangular and labeled either by their model, \u201ciHD23,\u201d or by a serial number including the vendor\u2019s initials, \u201cDC.\u201d In a few stores, security personnel \u2013 known as loss prevention or asset protection agents \u2013 showed Reuters how they worked.\nThe cameras matched facial images of customers entering a store to those of people Rite Aid previously observed engaging in potential criminal activity, causing an alert to be sent to security agents\u2019 smartphones. Agents then reviewed the match for accuracy and could tell the customer to leave.\nRite Aid told Reuters in a February statement that customers had been apprised of the technology through \u201csignage\u201d at the shops, as well as in a written policy posted this year on its website. Reporters found no notice of the surveillance in more than a third of the stores they visited with the facial recognition cameras.\nAmong the 75 stores Reuters visited, those in areas that were poorer or less white were much more likely to have the equipment, the news agency\u2019s statistical analysis found.\nStores in more impoverished areas were nearly three times as likely as those in richer areas to have facial recognition cameras. Seventeen of 25 stores in poorer areas had the systems. In wealthier areas, it was 10 of 40. (Ten of the stores were in areas whose wealth status was not clear. Six of those stores had the equipment.)\nIn areas where people of color, including Black or Latino residents, made up the largest racial or ethnic group, Reuters found that stores were more than three times as likely to have the technology.\nReuters\u2019 findings illustrate \u201cthe dire need for a national conversation about privacy, consumer education, transparency, and the need to safeguard the Constitutional rights of Americans,\u201d said Carolyn Maloney, the Democratic chairwoman of the House oversight committee, which has held hearings on the use of facial recognition technology.\nRite Aid said the rollout was \u201cdata-driven,\u201d based on stores\u2019 theft histories, local and national crime data and site infrastructure.\nCathy Langley, Rite Aid\u2019s vice president of asset protection, said earlier this year that facial recognition \u2013 which she referred to as \u201cfeature matching\u201d \u2013 resulted in less violence and organized crime in the company\u2019s stores. Last week, however, Rite Aid said its new leadership team was reviewing practices across the company, and \u201cthis was one of a number of programs that was terminated.\u201d\n\u2018ORWELLIAN SURVEILLANCE\u2019\nFacial recognition technology has become highly controversial in the United States as its use has expanded in both the public and private sectors, including by law enforcement and retailers. Civil liberties advocates warn it can lead to harassment of innocent individuals, arbitrary and discriminatory arrests, infringements of privacy rights and chilled personal expression.\nAdding to these concerns, recent research by a U.S. government institute showed that algorithms that underpin the technology erred more often here when subjects had darker skin tones.\nFacial recognition systems are largely unregulated in the United States, despite disclosure or consent requirements, or limits on government use, in several states, including California, Washington, Texas and Illinois. Some cities, including San Francisco, ban municipal officials from using them. In general, the technology makes photos and videos more readily searchable, allowing retailers almost instantaneous facial comparisons within and across stores.\nAmong the systems used by Rite Aid was one from DeepCam LLC, which worked with a firm in China whose largest outside investor is a Chinese government fund. Some security experts said any program with connections to China was troubling because it could open the door to aggressive surveillance in the United States more typical of an autocratic state.\nU.S. Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican and acting chair of the U.S. Senate\u2019s intelligence committee, told Reuters in a statement that the Rite Aid system\u2019s potential link to China was \u201coutrageous.\u201d \u201cThe Chinese Communist Party\u2019s buildup of its Orwellian surveillance state is alarming, and China\u2019s efforts to export its surveillance state to collect data in America would be an unacceptable, serious threat,\u201d he said.\nThe security specialists expressed concern that information gathered by a China-linked company could ultimately land in that government\u2019s hands, helping Beijing to refine its facial recognition technology globally and monitor people in ways that violate American standards of privacy.\n\u201cIf it goes back to China, there are no rules,\u201d said James Lewis, the Technology Policy Program director at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.\nAsked for comment, China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: \u201cThese are unfounded smears and rumors.\u201d\n\u2018A PROMISING NEW TOOL\u2019\nRite Aid, afflicted with financial losses in recent years, is not the only retailer to adopt or explore facial recognition technology.\nTwo years ago, the Loss Prevention Research Council, a coalition founded by retailers to test anti-crime techniques, called facial recognition \u201ca promising new tool\u201d worthy of evaluation.\n\u201cThere are a handful of retailers that have made the decision, \u2018Look, we need to leverage tech to sell more and lose less,\u201d said council director Read Hayes. Rite Aid\u2019s program was one of the largest, if not the largest, in retail, Hayes said. The Camp Hill, Pennsylvania-based company operates about 2,400 stores around the country.\nRELATED COVERAGE\nHow Reuters analyzed Rite Aid's use of facial recognition technology\nThe Home Depot Inc HD.N said it had been testing facial recognition to reduce shoplifting in at least one of its stores but stopped the trial this year. A smaller rival, Menards, piloted systems in at least 10 locations as of early 2019, a person familiar with that effort said.\nWalmart Inc WMT.N has also tried out facial recognition in a handful of stores, said two sources with knowledge of the tests. Walmart and Menards had no comment.\nUsing facial recognition to approach people who previously have committed \u201cdishonest acts\u201d in a store before they do so again is less dangerous for staff, said Rite Aid\u2019s former vice president of asset protection, Bob Oberosler, who made the decision to deploy an early facial recognition system at Rite Aid. That way, \u201cthere was significantly less need for law enforcement involvement,\u201d he said.\n\u2018TOUGHER\u2019 NEIGHBORHOODS\nIn interviews, 10 current and former Rite Aid loss prevention agents told Reuters that the system they initially used in stores was from a company called FaceFirst, which has been backed by U.S. investment firms.\nIt regularly misidentified people, all 10 of them said.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t pick up Black people well,\u201d one loss prevention staffer said last year while using FaceFirst at a Rite Aid in an African-American neighborhood of Detroit. \u201cIf your eyes are the same way, or if you\u2019re wearing your headband like another person is wearing a headband, you\u2019re going to get a hit.\u201d\nFaceFirst\u2019s chief executive, Peter Trepp, said facial recognition generally works well irrespective of skin tone, an issue he said the industry addressed years ago. He declined to talk about Rite Aid, saying he would not discuss any possible clients.\nRite Aid originally piloted FaceFirst at its store on West 3rd Street and South Vermont Avenue in Los Angeles, a largely Asian and Latino neighborhood, around 2012.\nOf the 65 stores the retailer targeted in its first big rollout, 52 were in areas where the largest group was Black or Latino, according to Reuters\u2019 analysis of a Rite Aid planning document from 2013 that was read aloud to a reporter by someone with access to it. Reuters confirmed that some of these stores later deployed the technology but did not confirm its presence at every location on the list.\nSeparately, two former Rite Aid managers and a third source familiar with the FaceFirst rollout said the systems were concentrated, respectively, in the \u201ctougher,\u201d \u201ctoughest\u201d or \u201cworst\u201d areas.\nReuters reviewed a 2016 spreadsheet from the company\u2019s asset protection unit in which Rite Aid rated 20 higher-earning Manhattan stores as having equal risk of loss \u2013 labeled \u201cMedHigh.\u201d Two of 10 stores where whites were the largest racial group had facial recognition technology when Reuters visited this year, whereas eight of the 10 in non-white areas had the systems.\nOne spot ranked \u201cMedHigh\u201d was a store at 741 Columbus Avenue in New York\u2019s whiter, wealthier Upper West Side. Another was the pharmacy\u2019s West 125th Street store in nearby Harlem, a majority African-American neighborhood. The Harlem store got facial recognition technology; the Upper West Side one did not, as of July 9.\n(See graphics here here and here here and here tmsnrt.rs/2EpMRhF?scatter=true)\n\u2018LOOKS NOTHING LIKE ME\u2019\nStarting in 2013, as Rite Aid deployed FaceFirst\u2019s technology in Philadelphia, Baltimore and beyond, some serious drawbacks emerged, current and former security agents and managers told Reuters.\nFor instance, the system would \u201cgenerate 500 hits in an hour all across the United States\u201d when photos in the system were blurry or taken at an odd angle, one of the people familiar with FaceFirst\u2019s operations said.\nFaceFirst\u2019s Trepp said the company has high accuracy rates while running \u201cover 12 trillion comparisons per day without any known complaints to date.\u201d\nDuring that earlier period, Tristan Jackson-Stankunas said Rite Aid wrongly fingered him as a shoplifter in a Los Angeles store based on someone else\u2019s photo. While Reuters could not confirm the method Rite Aid used to identify him, the store had FaceFirst technology by that time, according to a Rite Aid security agent and a Foursquare review photo showing the camera.\nAccording to a complaint Jackson-Stankunas filed with the California Department of Consumer Affairs a week after the incident, he was looking for air freshener in September 2016 when a manager ordered him to leave the store. The manager said he had received a security image of Jackson-Stankunas taken at another Rite Aid in 2013 from which he allegedly had stolen goods, according to the complaint.\nWhen Jackson-Stankunas viewed the photo on the manager\u2019s phone, he told Reuters, he saw nothing in common with the person except their race: Both are Black.\n\u201cThe guy looks nothing like me,\u201d said Jackson-Stankunas, 34, who ultimately was allowed to make his purchase and leave the store. Rite Aid \u201conly identified me because I was a person of color. That\u2019s it.\u201d\nThe California department told him his complaint fell outside its purview, directing him to another state office, email records show. Instead, he said he decided to write the store a bad review on Yelp.\nRite Aid and the manager who allegedly was involved declined to comment on Jackson-Stankunas\u2019 account.\nAt one store Reuters visited, a security agent scrolled through FaceFirst \u201calerts\u201d showing a number of cases in which faces were obviously mismatched, including a Black man mixed up with someone who was Asian. Reuters could not determine whether the incorrect matches resulted in confrontations with customers.\nFaceFirst CEO Trepp said that his company takes racial bias seriously and would not work with any business that disregarded civil rights. \u201cWe cannot stand for racial injustice of any kind, including in our technology,\u201d he said.\nGenerally, Trepp said, Reuters\u2019 findings about his company contained \u201cextensive factual inaccuracies\u201d and are \u201cnot based upon information from credible sources.\u201d\nSlideshow ( 8 images )\nA NEW SYSTEM\nEarly in 2018, Rite Aid began installing technology from DeepCam LLC, ultimately phasing out FaceFirst in stores around the country, interviews with Rite Aid loss prevention agents and internal vendor documents indicate.\nSix security staffers who used both systems said DeepCam\u2019s matches were more accurate \u2013 sometimes to a fault. The technology picked up faces from ads on buses or pictures on T-shirts, three said. One famous face captured in DeepCam was Marilyn Monroe\u2019s, one of the agents said.\nAt least until 2017, FaceFirst had employed an older method of biometric identification that compared maps of subjects\u2019 faces, two people familiar with its system said. Only later did it move over to software based on \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d like DeepCam\u2019s. Though the data and algorithms differ by brand, these systems draw upon potentially millions of samples to \u201clearn\u201d how to match faces.\nDeepCam cameras photographed and took live video of every person entering a Rite Aid store, aiming to create a unique facial profile, Rite Aid agents said. If the customer walked in front of another DeepCam facial recognition camera at a Rite Aid shop, new images were added to the person\u2019s existing profile. Two agents said they lost access to the images after 10 days unless the person landed on a watch list based on their behavior in stores.\nWhen agents saw someone commit a crime \u2013 or just do something suspicious, one said \u2013 they scrolled through profiles on their smartphone to search for the individual, only adding the person to the watch list with a manager\u2019s approval. The next time the shopper walked into a Rite Aid that had the technology, agents received a phone alert and checked the match for accuracy. Then they could order the person to leave, agents told Reuters.\nRite Aid said adding customers to the watch list was based on \u201cmultiple layers of meaningful human review.\u201d The company told Reuters its procedures ensured customers were not confronted unnecessarily.\nIf a person was found to be engaging in criminal behavior, Rite Aid said, \u201cwe retain the data as a matter of policy to cooperate in pending or potential criminal investigations.\u201d\nOther U.S. retail stores have tried DeepCam. Independent 7-Eleven franchise owners in Virginia told Reuters they conducted trials of the software starting in 2018 and later dropped it. They said they largely found the system accurate but not user friendly and too expensive to maintain. The system was advertised online as costing $99 a month.\n7-Eleven Inc did not answer requests for comment.\nTHE CHINA CONNECTION\nThe two founding owners of U.S.-based DeepCam LLC were Don Knasel and Jingfeng Liu, who set up the firm in Longmont, Colorado, in 2017, state records show. Liu\u2019s residential address in Longmont was listed as its headquarters.\nA Chinese native with U.S. citizenship and a doctorate from Carnegie Mellon University, Liu had the skills to do business in both the United States and China.\nAccording to China\u2019s official business registration records, he is chairman of another facial recognition firm in China called Shenzhen Shenmu Information Technology Co Ltd, whose website is DeepCam.com.\nFor a time, the U.S.-based DeepCam LLC and Shenzhen Shenmu were closely connected: In addition to Liu\u2019s role in both companies, they shared the same website and email accounts, according to internal records seen by Reuters.\nSlideshow ( 8 images )\nInternal correspondence reviewed by Reuters suggests that DeepCam reached a deal with Rite Aid by March 2018, when a colleague emailed Knasel to congratulate him. Internal records also indicated that China-based Shenzhen Shenmu helped its American counterpart with product development and that Liu was expected to pay at least some of the bills. That same month, a U.S. executive wrote: \u201cHi Jingfeng- Thanks for the credit card. Here is the receipt for the Indianapolis Trade Show.\u201d\nIn an interview, Liu confirmed the financing, saying of Knasel: \u201cWhenever he needed money, I give him some money.\u201d Liu said Knasel told him about the Rite Aid project but left him in the dark about the business. Knasel \u201cnever let data cross between the two countries,\u201d Liu said.\nAs the Rite Aid rollout proceeded in 2018, correspondence among DeepCam staff, seen by Reuters, expressed concerns about publicly revealing any links to China, as well as using the term \u201cfacial recognition\u201d in the U.S. market for fear of attracting the attention of the American Civil Liberties Union.\nDays after the ACLU wrote a March 2018 blog post here critical of retailers\u2019 suspected use of the technology, including Rite Aid\u2019s, Knasel emailed staff: \u201cIt looks like the ACLU may be starting to stick its head up....We need to tone down facial recognition, which I have tried to do....If they come after us, we are dead....so we have to avoid.\u201d The punctuation in the message is Knasel\u2019s.\nJay Stanley, the ACLU senior policy analyst who co-authored the blog post, told Reuters that the right response to civil liberties concerns about surveillance technology \u201cis not to start using it in secret.\u201d\nIt is \u201cto stop using the technology altogether. We are glad Rite Aid seems to have ultimately recognized this.\u201d\nToday, both Liu and Knasel say no ties exist between the U.S. and Chinese businesses.\n\u201cWe never do any business in USA,\u201d Liu wrote in a brief email to Reuters in March. \u201cWe focus in China market.\u201d\nMore recently, in an interview and an email, Liu said he had not spoken with Knasel for more than a year and, to his disappointment, had not benefited from the U.S. venture.\nIn a statement to Reuters, Knasel sought to distance himself from Liu, Shenzhen Shenmu and DeepCam.\nHe did not address questions about DeepCam\u2019s deal with Rite Aid. DeepCam, he said, is \u201cwinding up\u201d its operations and now has no assets. He added that DeepCam never supplied China-based Shenzhen Shenmu with any data.\nIn February, Rite Aid told Reuters that DeepCam had been \u201cre-branded\u201d as pdActive.

And for more than a year, the retailer used state-of-the-art facial recognition technology from a company with links to China and its authoritarian government.\nIn telephone and email exchanges with Reuters since February, Rite Aid confirmed the existence and breadth of its facial recognition program. The retailer defended the technology\u2019s use, saying it had nothing to do with race and was intended to deter theft and protect staff and customers from violence. Reuters found no evidence that Rite Aid\u2019s data was sent to China.\nLast week, however, after Reuters sent its findings to the retailer, Rite Aid said it had quit using its facial recognition software. It later said all the cameras had been turned off.\n\u201cThis decision was in part based on a larger industry conversation,\u201d the company told Reuters in a statement, adding that \u201cother large technology companies seem to be scaling back or rethinking their efforts around facial recognition given increasing uncertainty around the technology\u2019s utility.\u201d\nReuters pieced together how the company\u2019s initiative evolved, how the software has been used and how a recent vendor was linked to China, drawing on thousands of pages of internal documents from Rite Aid and its suppliers, as well as direct observations during store visits by Reuters journalists and interviews with more than 40 people familiar with the systems\u2019 deployment. Most current and former employees spoke on condition of anonymity, saying they feared jeopardizing their careers.\nWhile Rite Aid declined to disclose which locations used the technology, Reuters found facial recognition cameras at 33 of the 75 Rite Aid shops in Manhattan and the central Los Angeles metropolitan area during one or more visits from October through July.\nThe cameras were easily recognizable, hanging from the ceiling on poles near store entrances and in cosmetics aisles. Most were about half a foot long, rectangular and labeled either by their model, \u201ciHD23,\u201d or by a serial number including the vendor\u2019s initials, \u201cDC.\u201d In a few stores, security personnel \u2013 known as loss prevention or asset protection agents \u2013 showed Reuters how they worked.\nThe cameras matched facial images of customers entering a store to those of people Rite Aid previously observed engaging in potential criminal activity, causing an alert to be sent to security agents\u2019 smartphones. Agents then reviewed the match for accuracy and could tell the customer to leave.\nRite Aid told Reuters in a February statement that customers had been apprised of the technology through \u201csignage\u201d at the shops, as well as in a written policy posted this year on its website. Reporters found no notice of the surveillance in more than a third of the stores they visited with the facial recognition cameras.\nAmong the 75 stores Reuters visited, those in areas that were poorer or less white were much more likely to have the equipment, the news agency\u2019s statistical analysis found.\nStores in more impoverished areas were nearly three times as likely as those in richer areas to have facial recognition cameras. Seventeen of 25 stores in poorer areas had the systems. In wealthier areas, it was 10 of 40. (Ten of the stores were in areas whose wealth status was not clear. Six of those stores had the equipment.)\nIn areas where people of color, including Black or Latino residents, made up the largest racial or ethnic group, Reuters found that stores were more than three times as likely to have the technology.\nReuters\u2019 findings illustrate \u201cthe dire need for a national conversation about privacy, consumer education, transparency, and the need to safeguard the Constitutional rights of Americans,\u201d said Carolyn Maloney, the Democratic chairwoman of the House oversight committee, which has held hearings on the use of facial recognition technology.\nRite Aid said the rollout was \u201cdata-driven,\u201d based on stores\u2019 theft histories, local and national crime data and site infrastructure.\nCathy Langley, Rite Aid\u2019s vice president of asset protection, said earlier this year that facial recognition \u2013 which she referred to as \u201cfeature matching\u201d \u2013 resulted in less violence and organized crime in the company\u2019s stores. Last week, however, Rite Aid said its new leadership team was reviewing practices across the company, and \u201cthis was one of a number of programs that was terminated.\u201d\n\u2018ORWELLIAN SURVEILLANCE\u2019\nFacial recognition technology has become highly controversial in the United States as its use has expanded in both the public and private sectors, including by law enforcement and retailers. Civil liberties advocates warn it can lead to harassment of innocent individuals, arbitrary and discriminatory arrests, infringements of privacy rights and chilled personal expression.\nAdding to these concerns, recent research by a U.S. government institute showed that algorithms that underpin the technology erred more often here when subjects had darker skin tones.\nFacial recognition systems are largely unregulated in the United States, despite disclosure or consent requirements, or limits on government use, in several states, including California, Washington, Texas and Illinois. Some cities, including San Francisco, ban municipal officials from using them. In general, the technology makes photos and videos more readily searchable, allowing retailers almost instantaneous facial comparisons within and across stores.\nAmong the systems used by Rite Aid was one from DeepCam LLC, which worked with a firm in China whose largest outside investor is a Chinese government fund. Some security experts said any program with connections to China was troubling because it could open the door to aggressive surveillance in the United States more typical of an autocratic state.\nU.S. Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican and acting chair of the U.S. Senate\u2019s intelligence committee, told Reuters in a statement that the Rite Aid system\u2019s potential link to China was \u201coutrageous.\u201d \u201cThe Chinese Communist Party\u2019s buildup of its Orwellian surveillance state is alarming, and China\u2019s efforts to export its surveillance state to collect data in America would be an unacceptable, serious threat,\u201d he said.\nThe security specialists expressed concern that information gathered by a China-linked company could ultimately land in that government\u2019s hands, helping Beijing to refine its facial recognition technology globally and monitor people in ways that violate American standards of privacy.\n\u201cIf it goes back to China, there are no rules,\u201d said James Lewis, the Technology Policy Program director at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.\nAsked for comment, China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: \u201cThese are unfounded smears and rumors.\u201d\n\u2018A PROMISING NEW TOOL\u2019\nRite Aid, afflicted with financial losses in recent years, is not the only retailer to adopt or explore facial recognition technology.\nTwo years ago, the Loss Prevention Research Council, a coalition founded by retailers to test anti-crime techniques, called facial recognition \u201ca promising new tool\u201d worthy of evaluation.\n\u201cThere are a handful of retailers that have made the decision, \u2018Look, we need to leverage tech to sell more and lose less,\u201d said council director Read Hayes. Rite Aid\u2019s program was one of the largest, if not the largest, in retail, Hayes said. The Camp Hill, Pennsylvania-based company operates about 2,400 stores around the country.\nRELATED COVERAGE\nHow Reuters analyzed Rite Aid's use of facial recognition technology\nThe Home Depot Inc HD.N said it had been testing facial recognition to reduce shoplifting in at least one of its stores but stopped the trial this year. A smaller rival, Menards, piloted systems in at least 10 locations as of early 2019, a person familiar with that effort said.\nWalmart Inc WMT.N has also tried out facial recognition in a handful of stores, said two sources with knowledge of the tests. Walmart and Menards had no comment.\nUsing facial recognition to approach people who previously have committed \u201cdishonest acts\u201d in a store before they do so again is less dangerous for staff, said Rite Aid\u2019s former vice president of asset protection, Bob Oberosler, who made the decision to deploy an early facial recognition system at Rite Aid. That way, \u201cthere was significantly less need for law enforcement involvement,\u201d he said.\n\u2018TOUGHER\u2019 NEIGHBORHOODS\nIn interviews, 10 current and former Rite Aid loss prevention agents told Reuters that the system they initially used in stores was from a company called FaceFirst, which has been backed by U.S. investment firms.\nIt regularly misidentified people, all 10 of them said.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t pick up Black people well,\u201d one loss prevention staffer said last year while using FaceFirst at a Rite Aid in an African-American neighborhood of Detroit. \u201cIf your eyes are the same way, or if you\u2019re wearing your headband like another person is wearing a headband, you\u2019re going to get a hit.\u201d\nFaceFirst\u2019s chief executive, Peter Trepp, said facial recognition generally works well irrespective of skin tone, an issue he said the industry addressed years ago. He declined to talk about Rite Aid, saying he would not discuss any possible clients.\nRite Aid originally piloted FaceFirst at its store on West 3rd Street and South Vermont Avenue in Los Angeles, a largely Asian and Latino neighborhood, around 2012.\nOf the 65 stores the retailer targeted in its first big rollout, 52 were in areas where the largest group was Black or Latino, according to Reuters\u2019 analysis of a Rite Aid planning document from 2013 that was read aloud to a reporter by someone with access to it. Reuters confirmed that some of these stores later deployed the technology but did not confirm its presence at every location on the list.\nSeparately, two former Rite Aid managers and a third source familiar with the FaceFirst rollout said the systems were concentrated, respectively, in the \u201ctougher,\u201d \u201ctoughest\u201d or \u201cworst\u201d areas.\nReuters reviewed a 2016 spreadsheet from the company\u2019s asset protection unit in which Rite Aid rated 20 higher-earning Manhattan stores as having equal risk of loss \u2013 labeled \u201cMedHigh.\u201d Two of 10 stores where whites were the largest racial group had facial recognition technology when Reuters visited this year, whereas eight of the 10 in non-white areas had the systems.\nOne spot ranked \u201cMedHigh\u201d was a store at 741 Columbus Avenue in New York\u2019s whiter, wealthier Upper West Side. Another was the pharmacy\u2019s West 125th Street store in nearby Harlem, a majority African-American neighborhood. The Harlem store got facial recognition technology; the Upper West Side one did not, as of July 9.\n(See graphics here here and here here and here tmsnrt.rs/2EpMRhF?scatter=true)\n\u2018LOOKS NOTHING LIKE ME\u2019\nStarting in 2013, as Rite Aid deployed FaceFirst\u2019s technology in Philadelphia, Baltimore and beyond, some serious drawbacks emerged, current and former security agents and managers told Reuters.\nFor instance, the system would \u201cgenerate 500 hits in an hour all across the United States\u201d when photos in the system were blurry or taken at an odd angle, one of the people familiar with FaceFirst\u2019s operations said.\nFaceFirst\u2019s Trepp said the company has high accuracy rates while running \u201cover 12 trillion comparisons per day without any known complaints to date.\u201d\nDuring that earlier period, Tristan Jackson-Stankunas said Rite Aid wrongly fingered him as a shoplifter in a Los Angeles store based on someone else\u2019s photo. While Reuters could not confirm the method Rite Aid used to identify him, the store had FaceFirst technology by that time, according to a Rite Aid security agent and a Foursquare review photo showing the camera.\nAccording to a complaint Jackson-Stankunas filed with the California Department of Consumer Affairs a week after the incident, he was looking for air freshener in September 2016 when a manager ordered him to leave the store. The manager said he had received a security image of Jackson-Stankunas taken at another Rite Aid in 2013 from which he allegedly had stolen goods, according to the complaint.\nWhen Jackson-Stankunas viewed the photo on the manager\u2019s phone, he told Reuters, he saw nothing in common with the person except their race: Both are Black.\n\u201cThe guy looks nothing like me,\u201d said Jackson-Stankunas, 34, who ultimately was allowed to make his purchase and leave the store. Rite Aid \u201conly identified me because I was a person of color. That\u2019s it.\u201d\nThe California department told him his complaint fell outside its purview, directing him to another state office, email records show. Instead, he said he decided to write the store a bad review on Yelp.\nRite Aid and the manager who allegedly was involved declined to comment on Jackson-Stankunas\u2019 account.\nAt one store Reuters visited, a security agent scrolled through FaceFirst \u201calerts\u201d showing a number of cases in which faces were obviously mismatched, including a Black man mixed up with someone who was Asian. Reuters could not determine whether the incorrect matches resulted in confrontations with customers.\nFaceFirst CEO Trepp said that his company takes racial bias seriously and would not work with any business that disregarded civil rights. \u201cWe cannot stand for racial injustice of any kind, including in our technology,\u201d he said.\nGenerally, Trepp said, Reuters\u2019 findings about his company contained \u201cextensive factual inaccuracies\u201d and are \u201cnot based upon information from credible sources.\u201d\nSlideshow ( 8 images )\nA NEW SYSTEM\nEarly in 2018, Rite Aid began installing technology from DeepCam LLC, ultimately phasing out FaceFirst in stores around the country, interviews with Rite Aid loss prevention agents and internal vendor documents indicate.\nSix security staffers who used both systems said DeepCam\u2019s matches were more accurate \u2013 sometimes to a fault. The technology picked up faces from ads on buses or pictures on T-shirts, three said. One famous face captured in DeepCam was Marilyn Monroe\u2019s, one of the agents said.\nAt least until 2017, FaceFirst had employed an older method of biometric identification that compared maps of subjects\u2019 faces, two people familiar with its system said. Only later did it move over to software based on \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d like DeepCam\u2019s. Though the data and algorithms differ by brand, these systems draw upon potentially millions of samples to \u201clearn\u201d how to match faces.\nDeepCam cameras photographed and took live video of every person entering a Rite Aid store, aiming to create a unique facial profile, Rite Aid agents said. If the customer walked in front of another DeepCam facial recognition camera at a Rite Aid shop, new images were added to the person\u2019s existing profile. Two agents said they lost access to the images after 10 days unless the person landed on a watch list based on their behavior in stores.\nWhen agents saw someone commit a crime \u2013 or just do something suspicious, one said \u2013 they scrolled through profiles on their smartphone to search for the individual, only adding the person to the watch list with a manager\u2019s approval. The next time the shopper walked into a Rite Aid that had the technology, agents received a phone alert and checked the match for accuracy. Then they could order the person to leave, agents told Reuters.\nRite Aid said adding customers to the watch list was based on \u201cmultiple layers of meaningful human review.\u201d The company told Reuters its procedures ensured customers were not confronted unnecessarily.\nIf a person was found to be engaging in criminal behavior, Rite Aid said, \u201cwe retain the data as a matter of policy to cooperate in pending or potential criminal investigations.\u201d\nOther U.S. retail stores have tried DeepCam. Independent 7-Eleven franchise owners in Virginia told Reuters they conducted trials of the software starting in 2018 and later dropped it. They said they largely found the system accurate but not user friendly and too expensive to maintain. The system was advertised online as costing $99 a month.\n7-Eleven Inc did not answer requests for comment.\nTHE CHINA CONNECTION\nThe two founding owners of U.S.-based DeepCam LLC were Don Knasel and Jingfeng Liu, who set up the firm in Longmont, Colorado, in 2017, state records show. Liu\u2019s residential address in Longmont was listed as its headquarters.\nA Chinese native with U.S. citizenship and a doctorate from Carnegie Mellon University, Liu had the skills to do business in both the United States and China.\nAccording to China\u2019s official business registration records, he is chairman of another facial recognition firm in China called Shenzhen Shenmu Information Technology Co Ltd, whose website is DeepCam.com.\nFor a time, the U.S.-based DeepCam LLC and Shenzhen Shenmu were closely connected: In addition to Liu\u2019s role in both companies, they shared the same website and email accounts, according to internal records seen by Reuters.\nSlideshow ( 8 images )\nInternal correspondence reviewed by Reuters suggests that DeepCam reached a deal with Rite Aid by March 2018, when a colleague emailed Knasel to congratulate him. Internal records also indicated that China-based Shenzhen Shenmu helped its American counterpart with product development and that Liu was expected to pay at least some of the bills. That same month, a U.S. executive wrote: \u201cHi Jingfeng- Thanks for the credit card. Here is the receipt for the Indianapolis Trade Show.\u201d\nIn an interview, Liu confirmed the financing, saying of Knasel: \u201cWhenever he needed money, I give him some money.\u201d Liu said Knasel told him about the Rite Aid project but left him in the dark about the business. Knasel \u201cnever let data cross between the two countries,\u201d Liu said.\nAs the Rite Aid rollout proceeded in 2018, correspondence among DeepCam staff, seen by Reuters, expressed concerns about publicly revealing any links to China, as well as using the term \u201cfacial recognition\u201d in the U.S. market for fear of attracting the attention of the American Civil Liberties Union.\nDays after the ACLU wrote a March 2018 blog post here critical of retailers\u2019 suspected use of the technology, including Rite Aid\u2019s, Knasel emailed staff: \u201cIt looks like the ACLU may be starting to stick its head up....We need to tone down facial recognition, which I have tried to do....If they come after us, we are dead....so we have to avoid.\u201d The punctuation in the message is Knasel\u2019s.\nJay Stanley, the ACLU senior policy analyst who co-authored the blog post, told Reuters that the right response to civil liberties concerns about surveillance technology \u201cis not to start using it in secret.\u201d\nIt is \u201cto stop using the technology altogether. We are glad Rite Aid seems to have ultimately recognized this.\u201d\nToday, both Liu and Knasel say no ties exist between the U.S. and Chinese businesses.\n\u201cWe never do any business in USA,\u201d Liu wrote in a brief email to Reuters in March. \u201cWe focus in China market.\u201d\nMore recently, in an interview and an email, Liu said he had not spoken with Knasel for more than a year and, to his disappointment, had not benefited from the U.S. venture.\nIn a statement to Reuters, Knasel sought to distance himself from Liu, Shenzhen Shenmu and DeepCam.\nHe did not address questions about DeepCam\u2019s deal with Rite Aid. DeepCam, he said, is \u201cwinding up\u201d its operations and now has no assets. He added that DeepCam never supplied China-based Shenzhen Shenmu with any data.\nIn February, Rite Aid told Reuters that DeepCam had been \u201cre-branded\u201d as pdActive. PdActive is a facial recognition company run by Knasel, who said it is not a rebranding of DeepCam but a different company that has no owners who are Chinese citizens.\nKnasel remained connected to DeepCam through another company he runs, dcAnalytics, which Knasel said licensed DeepCam\u2019s technology until November 2019. Since then, Knasel said, U.S.-based dcAnalytics has been using \u201cproprietary\u201d technology, as well as facial recognition cameras purchased from DeepCam.\nKnasel said dcAnalytics is \u201ccommitted to upholding the highest standards possible to make sure facial recognition technology is used fairly, properly and responsibly.\u201d\nSENSITIVE QUESTIONS\nSteve Dickinson, a Seattle attorney who practiced law in China for more than a decade and writes about cybersecurity, said geopolitical tensions have added sensitivity to any work Chinese surveillance firms do in the United States.\nLast year, the U.S. government blacklisted several Chinese companies \u2013 including Hikvision 002415.SZ, one of the biggest surveillance camera manufacturers globally \u2013 alleging involvement in human rights abuses.

And for more than a year, the retailer used state-of-the-art facial recognition technology from a company with links to China and its authoritarian government.\nIn telephone and email exchanges with Reuters since February, Rite Aid confirmed the existence and breadth of its facial recognition program. The retailer defended the technology\u2019s use, saying it had nothing to do with race and was intended to deter theft and protect staff and customers from violence. Reuters found no evidence that Rite Aid\u2019s data was sent to China.\nLast week, however, after Reuters sent its findings to the retailer, Rite Aid said it had quit using its facial recognition software. It later said all the cameras had been turned off.\n\u201cThis decision was in part based on a larger industry conversation,\u201d the company told Reuters in a statement, adding that \u201cother large technology companies seem to be scaling back or rethinking their efforts around facial recognition given increasing uncertainty around the technology\u2019s utility.\u201d\nReuters pieced together how the company\u2019s initiative evolved, how the software has been used and how a recent vendor was linked to China, drawing on thousands of pages of internal documents from Rite Aid and its suppliers, as well as direct observations during store visits by Reuters journalists and interviews with more than 40 people familiar with the systems\u2019 deployment. Most current and former employees spoke on condition of anonymity, saying they feared jeopardizing their careers.\nWhile Rite Aid declined to disclose which locations used the technology, Reuters found facial recognition cameras at 33 of the 75 Rite Aid shops in Manhattan and the central Los Angeles metropolitan area during one or more visits from October through July.\nThe cameras were easily recognizable, hanging from the ceiling on poles near store entrances and in cosmetics aisles. Most were about half a foot long, rectangular and labeled either by their model, \u201ciHD23,\u201d or by a serial number including the vendor\u2019s initials, \u201cDC.\u201d In a few stores, security personnel \u2013 known as loss prevention or asset protection agents \u2013 showed Reuters how they worked.\nThe cameras matched facial images of customers entering a store to those of people Rite Aid previously observed engaging in potential criminal activity, causing an alert to be sent to security agents\u2019 smartphones. Agents then reviewed the match for accuracy and could tell the customer to leave.\nRite Aid told Reuters in a February statement that customers had been apprised of the technology through \u201csignage\u201d at the shops, as well as in a written policy posted this year on its website. Reporters found no notice of the surveillance in more than a third of the stores they visited with the facial recognition cameras.\nAmong the 75 stores Reuters visited, those in areas that were poorer or less white were much more likely to have the equipment, the news agency\u2019s statistical analysis found.\nStores in more impoverished areas were nearly three times as likely as those in richer areas to have facial recognition cameras. Seventeen of 25 stores in poorer areas had the systems. In wealthier areas, it was 10 of 40. (Ten of the stores were in areas whose wealth status was not clear. Six of those stores had the equipment.)\nIn areas where people of color, including Black or Latino residents, made up the largest racial or ethnic group, Reuters found that stores were more than three times as likely to have the technology.\nReuters\u2019 findings illustrate \u201cthe dire need for a national conversation about privacy, consumer education, transparency, and the need to safeguard the Constitutional rights of Americans,\u201d said Carolyn Maloney, the Democratic chairwoman of the House oversight committee, which has held hearings on the use of facial recognition technology.\nRite Aid said the rollout was \u201cdata-driven,\u201d based on stores\u2019 theft histories, local and national crime data and site infrastructure.\nCathy Langley, Rite Aid\u2019s vice president of asset protection, said earlier this year that facial recognition \u2013 which she referred to as \u201cfeature matching\u201d \u2013 resulted in less violence and organized crime in the company\u2019s stores. Last week, however, Rite Aid said its new leadership team was reviewing practices across the company, and \u201cthis was one of a number of programs that was terminated.\u201d\n\u2018ORWELLIAN SURVEILLANCE\u2019\nFacial recognition technology has become highly controversial in the United States as its use has expanded in both the public and private sectors, including by law enforcement and retailers. Civil liberties advocates warn it can lead to harassment of innocent individuals, arbitrary and discriminatory arrests, infringements of privacy rights and chilled personal expression.\nAdding to these concerns, recent research by a U.S. government institute showed that algorithms that underpin the technology erred more often here when subjects had darker skin tones.\nFacial recognition systems are largely unregulated in the United States, despite disclosure or consent requirements, or limits on government use, in several states, including California, Washington, Texas and Illinois. Some cities, including San Francisco, ban municipal officials from using them. In general, the technology makes photos and videos more readily searchable, allowing retailers almost instantaneous facial comparisons within and across stores.\nAmong the systems used by Rite Aid was one from DeepCam LLC, which worked with a firm in China whose largest outside investor is a Chinese government fund. Some security experts said any program with connections to China was troubling because it could open the door to aggressive surveillance in the United States more typical of an autocratic state.\nU.S. Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican and acting chair of the U.S. Senate\u2019s intelligence committee, told Reuters in a statement that the Rite Aid system\u2019s potential link to China was \u201coutrageous.\u201d \u201cThe Chinese Communist Party\u2019s buildup of its Orwellian surveillance state is alarming, and China\u2019s efforts to export its surveillance state to collect data in America would be an unacceptable, serious threat,\u201d he said.\nThe security specialists expressed concern that information gathered by a China-linked company could ultimately land in that government\u2019s hands, helping Beijing to refine its facial recognition technology globally and monitor people in ways that violate American standards of privacy.\n\u201cIf it goes back to China, there are no rules,\u201d said James Lewis, the Technology Policy Program director at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.\nAsked for comment, China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: \u201cThese are unfounded smears and rumors.\u201d\n\u2018A PROMISING NEW TOOL\u2019\nRite Aid, afflicted with financial losses in recent years, is not the only retailer to adopt or explore facial recognition technology.\nTwo years ago, the Loss Prevention Research Council, a coalition founded by retailers to test anti-crime techniques, called facial recognition \u201ca promising new tool\u201d worthy of evaluation.\n\u201cThere are a handful of retailers that have made the decision, \u2018Look, we need to leverage tech to sell more and lose less,\u201d said council director Read Hayes. Rite Aid\u2019s program was one of the largest, if not the largest, in retail, Hayes said. The Camp Hill, Pennsylvania-based company operates about 2,400 stores around the country.\nThe Home Depot Inc said it had been testing facial recognition to reduce shoplifting in at least one of its stores but stopped the trial this year. A smaller rival, Menards, piloted systems in at least 10 locations as of early 2019, a person familiar with that effort said.\nWalmart Inc has also tried out facial recognition in a handful of stores, said two sources with knowledge of the tests. Walmart and Menards had no comment.\nUsing facial recognition to approach people who previously have committed \u201cdishonest acts\u201d in a store before they do so again is less dangerous for staff, said Rite Aid\u2019s former vice president of asset protection, Bob Oberosler, who made the decision to deploy an early facial recognition system at Rite Aid. That way, \u201cthere was significantly less need for law enforcement involvement,\u201d he said.\n\u2018TOUGHER\u2019 NEIGHBORHOODS\nIn interviews, 10 current and former Rite Aid loss prevention agents told Reuters that the system they initially used in stores was from a company called FaceFirst, which has been backed by U.S. investment firms.\nIt regularly misidentified people, all 10 of them said.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t pick up Black people well,\u201d one loss prevention staffer said last year while using FaceFirst at a Rite Aid in an African-American neighborhood of Detroit. \u201cIf your eyes are the same way, or if you\u2019re wearing your headband like another person is wearing a headband, you\u2019re going to get a hit.\u201d\nFaceFirst\u2019s chief executive, Peter Trepp, said facial recognition generally works well irrespective of skin tone, an issue he said the industry addressed years ago. He declined to talk about Rite Aid, saying he would not discuss any possible clients.\nRite Aid originally piloted FaceFirst at its store on West 3rd Street and South Vermont Avenue in Los Angeles, a largely Asian and Latino neighborhood, around 2012.\nOf the 65 stores the retailer targeted in its first big rollout, 52 were in areas where the largest group was Black or Latino, according to Reuters\u2019 analysis of a Rite Aid planning document from 2013 that was read aloud to a reporter by someone with access to it. Reuters confirmed that some of these stores later deployed the technology but did not confirm its presence at every location on the list.\nSeparately, two former Rite Aid managers and a third source familiar with the FaceFirst rollout said the systems were concentrated, respectively, in the \u201ctougher,\u201d \u201ctoughest\u201d or \u201cworst\u201d areas.\nReuters reviewed a 2016 spreadsheet from the company\u2019s asset protection unit in which Rite Aid rated 20 higher-earning Manhattan stores as having equal risk of loss \u2013 labeled \u201cMedHigh.\u201d Two of 10 stores where whites were the largest racial group had facial recognition technology when Reuters visited this year, whereas eight of the 10 in non-white areas had the systems.\nOne spot ranked \u201cMedHigh\u201d was a store at 741 Columbus Avenue in New York\u2019s whiter, wealthier Upper West Side. Another was the pharmacy\u2019s West 125th Street store in nearby Harlem, a majority African-American neighborhood. The Harlem store got facial recognition technology; the Upper West Side one did not, as of July 9.\n(See graphics here here and here here and here tmsnrt.rs/2EpMRhF?scatter=true)\n\u2018LOOKS NOTHING LIKE ME\u2019\nStarting in 2013, as Rite Aid deployed FaceFirst\u2019s technology in Philadelphia, Baltimore and beyond, some serious drawbacks emerged, current and former security agents and managers told Reuters.\nFor instance, the system would \u201cgenerate 500 hits in an hour all across the United States\u201d when photos in the system were blurry or taken at an odd angle, one of the people familiar with FaceFirst\u2019s operations said.\nFaceFirst\u2019s Trepp said the company has high accuracy rates while running \u201cover 12 trillion comparisons per day without any known complaints to date.\u201d\nDuring that earlier period, Tristan Jackson-Stankunas said Rite Aid wrongly fingered him as a shoplifter in a Los Angeles store based on someone else\u2019s photo. While Reuters could not confirm the method Rite Aid used to identify him, the store had FaceFirst technology by that time, according to a Rite Aid security agent and a Foursquare review photo showing the camera.\nAccording to a complaint Jackson-Stankunas filed with the California Department of Consumer Affairs a week after the incident, he was looking for air freshener in September 2016 when a manager ordered him to leave the store. The manager said he had received a security image of Jackson-Stankunas taken at another Rite Aid in 2013 from which he allegedly had stolen goods, according to the complaint.\nWhen Jackson-Stankunas viewed the photo on the manager\u2019s phone, he told Reuters, he saw nothing in common with the person except their race: Both are Black.\n\u201cThe guy looks nothing like me,\u201d said Jackson-Stankunas, 34, who ultimately was allowed to make his purchase and leave the store. Rite Aid \u201conly identified me because I was a person of color. That\u2019s it.\u201d\nThe California department told him his complaint fell outside its purview, directing him to another state office, email records show. Instead, he said he decided to write the store a bad review on Yelp.\nRite Aid and the manager who allegedly was involved declined to comment on Jackson-Stankunas\u2019 account.\nAt one store Reuters visited, a security agent scrolled through FaceFirst \u201calerts\u201d showing a number of cases in which faces were obviously mismatched, including a Black man mixed up with someone who was Asian. Reuters could not determine whether the incorrect matches resulted in confrontations with customers.\nFaceFirst CEO Trepp said that his company takes racial bias seriously and would not work with any business that disregarded civil rights. \u201cWe cannot stand for racial injustice of any kind, including in our technology,\u201d he said.\nGenerally, Trepp said, Reuters\u2019 findings about his company contained \u201cextensive factual inaccuracies\u201d and are \u201cnot based upon information from credible sources.\u201d\nA NEW SYSTEM\nEarly in 2018, Rite Aid began installing technology from DeepCam LLC, ultimately phasing out FaceFirst in stores around the country, interviews with Rite Aid loss prevention agents and internal vendor documents indicate.\nSix security staffers who used both systems said DeepCam\u2019s matches were more accurate \u2013 sometimes to a fault. The technology picked up faces from ads on buses or pictures on T-shirts, three said. One famous face captured in DeepCam was Marilyn Monroe\u2019s, one of the agents said.\nAt least until 2017, FaceFirst had employed an older method of biometric identification that compared maps of subjects\u2019 faces, two people familiar with its system said. Only later did it move over to software based on \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d like DeepCam\u2019s. Though the data and algorithms differ by brand, these systems draw upon potentially millions of samples to \u201clearn\u201d how to match faces.\nDeepCam cameras photographed and took live video of every person entering a Rite Aid store, aiming to create a unique facial profile, Rite Aid agents said. If the customer walked in front of another DeepCam facial recognition camera at a Rite Aid shop, new images were added to the person\u2019s existing profile. Two agents said they lost access to the images after 10 days unless the person landed on a watch list based on their behavior in stores.\nWhen agents saw someone commit a crime \u2013 or just do something suspicious, one said \u2013 they scrolled through profiles on their smartphone to search for the individual, only adding the person to the watch list with a manager\u2019s approval. The next time the shopper walked into a Rite Aid that had the technology, agents received a phone alert and checked the match for accuracy. Then they could order the person to leave, agents told Reuters.\nRite Aid said adding customers to the watch list was based on \u201cmultiple layers of meaningful human review.\u201d The company told Reuters its procedures ensured customers were not confronted unnecessarily.\nIf a person was found to be engaging in criminal behavior, Rite Aid said, \u201cwe retain the data as a matter of policy to cooperate in pending or potential criminal investigations.\u201d\nOther U.S. retail stores have tried DeepCam. Independent 7-Eleven franchise owners in Virginia told Reuters they conducted trials of the software starting in 2018 and later dropped it. They said they largely found the system accurate but not user friendly and too expensive to maintain. The system was advertised online as costing $99 a month.\n7-Eleven Inc did not answer requests for comment.\nTHE CHINA CONNECTION\nThe two founding owners of U.S.-based DeepCam LLC were Don Knasel and Jingfeng Liu, who set up the firm in Longmont, Colorado, in 2017, state records show. Liu\u2019s residential address in Longmont was listed as its headquarters.\nA Chinese native with U.S. citizenship and a doctorate from Carnegie Mellon University, Liu had the skills to do business in both the United States and China.\nAccording to China\u2019s official business registration records, he is chairman of another facial recognition firm in China called Shenzhen Shenmu Information Technology Co Ltd, whose website is DeepCam.com.\nFor a time, the U.S.-based DeepCam LLC and Shenzhen Shenmu were closely connected: In addition to Liu\u2019s role in both companies, they shared the same website and email accounts, according to internal records seen by Reuters.\nInternal correspondence reviewed by Reuters suggests that DeepCam reached a deal with Rite Aid by March 2018, when a colleague emailed Knasel to congratulate him. Internal records also indicated that China-based Shenzhen Shenmu helped its American counterpart with product development and that Liu was expected to pay at least some of the bills. That same month, a U.S. executive wrote: \u201cHi Jingfeng- Thanks for the credit card. Here is the receipt for the Indianapolis Trade Show.\u201d\nIn an interview, Liu confirmed the financing, saying of Knasel: \u201cWhenever he needed money, I give him some money.\u201d Liu said Knasel told him about the Rite Aid project but left him in the dark about the business. Knasel \u201cnever let data cross between the two countries,\u201d Liu said.\nAs the Rite Aid rollout proceeded in 2018, correspondence among DeepCam staff, seen by Reuters, expressed concerns about publicly revealing any links to China, as well as using the term \u201cfacial recognition\u201d in the U.S. market for fear of attracting the attention of the American Civil Liberties Union.\nDays after the ACLU wrote a March 2018 blog post here critical of retailers\u2019 suspected use of the technology, including Rite Aid\u2019s, Knasel emailed staff: \u201cIt looks like the ACLU may be starting to stick its head up....We need to tone down facial recognition, which I have tried to do....If they come after us, we are dead....so we have to avoid.\u201d The punctuation in the message is Knasel\u2019s.\nToday, both Liu and Knasel say no ties exist between the U.S. and Chinese businesses.\n\u201cWe never do any business in USA,\u201d Liu wrote in a brief email to Reuters in March. \u201cWe focus in China market.\u201d\nMore recently, in an interview and an email, Liu said he had not spoken with Knasel for more than a year and, to his disappointment, had not benefited from the U.S. venture.\nIn a statement to Reuters, Knasel sought to distance himself from Liu, Shenzhen Shenmu and DeepCam.\nHe did not address questions about DeepCam\u2019s deal with Rite Aid. DeepCam, he said, is \u201cwinding up\u201d its operations and now has no assets. He added that DeepCam never supplied China-based Shenzhen Shenmu with any data.\nIn February, Rite Aid told Reuters that DeepCam had been \u201cre-branded\u201d as pdActive. PdActive is a facial recognition company run by Knasel, who said it is not a rebranding of DeepCam but a different company that has no owners who are Chinese citizens.\nKnasel remained connected to DeepCam through another company he runs, dcAnalytics, which Knasel said licensed DeepCam\u2019s technology until November 2019. Since then, Knasel said, U.S.-based dcAnalytics has been using \u201cproprietary\u201d technology, as well as facial recognition cameras purchased from DeepCam.\nKnasel said dcAnalytics is \u201ccommitted to upholding the highest standards possible to make sure facial recognition technology is used fairly, properly and responsibly.\u201d\nSENSITIVE QUESTIONS\nSteve Dickinson, a Seattle attorney who practiced law in China for more than a decade and writes about cybersecurity, said geopolitical tensions have added sensitivity to any work Chinese surveillance firms do in the United States.\nLast year, the U.S. government blacklisted several Chinese companies \u2013 including Hikvision, one of the biggest surveillance camera manufacturers globally \u2013 alleging involvement in human rights abuses. China has deployed facial recognition cameras widely within its borders, providing a level of monitoring unfathomable to many Americans.\nAt the time, a U.S. Hikvision spokesman said the firm \u201cstrongly opposes\u201d the decision and that punishing Hikvision would harm its U.S. business partners and discourage global companies from communicating with the U.S. government.\nLiu described his company as nothing like the Chinese video surveillance giants. With about 20 employees, he said, it is \u201ca tiny company pretending to be big,\u201d struggling unsuccessfully to get government contracts and nearly bankrupt.\nReuters found that he and his company have financial and other ties to the Chinese government, however.\nMost notably, Shenzhen Shenmu\u2019s largest outside investor, holding about 20% of its registered capital, is a strategic fund set up by the government of China. Called the SME Development Fund (Shenzhen Limited Partnership), it has built a 6 million yuan ($855,000) stake in Shenzhen Shenmu since early 2018, Chinese public business records show.\nA person with the same name as a Shenzhen Shenmu board director has also worked for the venture firm managing the SME fund, according to the records and the investment firm\u2019s website.\nThe fund acknowledged investing in Shenzhen Shenmu and said it \u201cdoes not participate in the daily operation and management of the enterprise.\u201d\nLiu is a member of China\u2019s Thousand Talents program, according to a local government website. That program was started by Beijing as a way to bring top academics working in important fields abroad back to China. According to allegations here by the U.S. Justice Department, the program aimed to steal foreign technology.\nIn a statement, China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs described such allegations as false and as \u201cstigmatization\u201d by the United States.\nLiu told Reuters he tried to get into the program but does not know if he is. The achievement was reported in an article on Shenzhen Shenmu\u2019s website, but Liu said he only wanted to use the distinction to help him sell products. Reuters was unable to confirm with China\u2019s government whether Liu was a member.\nAnother website, that of a Shenzhen Shenmu subsidiary, Magicision, claims its technology has helped officials arrest fugitives and suspected criminals in China.\nLiu was vague about the firm\u2019s public security work, saying his company has tried unsuccessfully to get contracts with Chinese law enforcement. He called the website\u2019s information \u201cbullshit marketing.\u201d\nAbout the Chinese government\u2019s interest in his company\u2019s data, however, he was clear.\n\u201cThe China government never care about us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are too small.\u201d\n\u201cI know (the) China threat is a hot, eyeball-attractive topic. But what you have in mind is totally untrue.\u201d\nReporting by Jeffrey Dastin in Los Angeles and New York; Data analysis by Ryan McNeill in London; Additional reporting by Cate Cadell and Yingzhi Yang in Beijing; Engen Tham and Brenda Goh in Shanghai; Farah Master in Hong Kong; the Beijing and Shanghai newsrooms; Lucas Jackson, Aleksandra Michalska and Samuel Hart in New York; Paresh Dave in Oakland; and Tom Bergin in London; Editing by Julie Marquis and Simon Robinson\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"url": "/article/idUSL5N2EZ1VP", "headline": "RPT-EXCLUSIVE-HSBC aims to double number of senior Black staff by 2025- memo", "published_date": "2020-07-28", "text": "By Sinead Cruise\n2 MIN READ\n(Repeats story that ran late Monday with no changes to text)\n* Bank aims to double Black staff at director rank by 2025\n* Black staff feel bank has not been vocal enough on race issues External search firm hired to find diverse candidates\nLONDON, July 27 (Reuters) - HSBC aims to double the number of Black staff in senior roles by 2025, Chief Executive Noel Quinn said in an internal memo, as the bank attempts to take action against discrimination and create opportunities for advancement in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement.\nBlack employees at the bank have said in internal meetings that they have felt overlooked for career opportunities and \u201cuninspired by the lack of senior role models\u201d, Quinn said in a memo to all staff seen by Reuters on Monday.\nADVERTISEMENT\nA spokeswoman for HSBC confirmed the contents of the memo.\nHSBC held meetings with Black staff following the spotlight put on systemic racism in the United States and worldwide after the killing of George Floyd in May.\nBlack employees in those meetings said \u201cHSBC has not been strong or vocal enough as an organisation on matters that concern them,\u201d Quinn told staff in the memo.\nIn response Quinn said the bank would aim to double by 2025 the number of Black staff at \u201cGCB3\u201d or higher level, a senior rank in the firm\u2019s hierarchy equivalent to director.\nThe bank did not say what proportion of its current senior employees are Black.\n\u201cThe Black Lives Matter movement has rightly created more urgent demand for action,\u201d Quinn said.\n\u201cI want us to be judged by the concrete, sustainable actions we take to be a more diverse and inclusive bank.\u201d\nThe move by HSBC to promote and hire more senior Black employees follows similar moves by other banks around the world including Goldman Sachs and Lloyds Banking Group .\nHSBC has also hired a recruiting firm to help it engage Black and ethnically diverse talent for leadership roles, Quinn said.\nReporting By Sinead Cruise, writing by Lawrence White, editing by Susan Fenton and Jane Merriman\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"url": "/article/idUSKCN24S13F", "headline": "Civil rights pioneer, Congressman John Lewis honored in Capitol Hill ceremony", "published_date": "2020-07-27", "text": "By Richard Cowan\n3 MIN READ\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The flag-draped coffin bearing the body of longtime U.S. Representative John Lewis was escorted on Monday to the Capitol where it will lie in state through Tuesday in a tribute to his life-long dedication to civil rights.\n Before arriving on Capitol Hill, the hearse carrying Lewis passed by Washington landmarks important to the American civil rights movement - the Lincoln Memorial and the nearby Martin Luther King, Jr., Memorial.\nAs the motorcade wound its way through the city, it slowed at a painted yellow mural on a street pavement near the White House that reads \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d in letters large enough to be seen from space, honoring the social movement of that name.\nA bystander was heard playing the hymn \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d on the harmonica.\nThe congressional arrival ceremony was held in the historic Rotunda of the Capitol.

Like most in Chicago, Easterling is not a fan of Trump, who won just 51 of the city\u2019s 2,069 precincts in the 2016 presidential election.\nEasterling, 54, has lived in Englewood since he was seven. He said crime is particularly bad this year and Trump should consider bringing in the National Guard and using drones to record evidence of crimes as they occur\nOthers were more cautious, saying they feared an increased federal presence would erode civil liberties in a city that has had long-standing problems with police brutality in poor, predominantly Black neighborhoods.\nTrump said last week that hundreds of officers from the FBI and other federal agencies would help fight crime in Chicago. The city is suffering a spike in violent crime, including a drive-by shooting by suspected gang members at a funeral last week that wounded 15 people.\nTrump has sought to project a law-and-order stance as he seeks re-election on Nov. 3, targeting cities controlled by Democrats who he says are soft on criminals. Critics say the administration is seeking to divert attention from its widely criticized response to the coronavirus pandemic.\nEight of 10 people Reuters interviewed in wealthier and safer areas on Chicago\u2019s North Side opposed any form of intervention from Trump, saying federal officers could fan tensions in the city and would not address underlying issues such as unemployment.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how the feds are going to help with anything,\u201d said Michael Flaherty, a 53-year-old architect who lives in Chicago\u2019s Gold Coast neighborhood.\n\u201cThey\u2019re violent.

The U.S. Justice Department said on Thursday it would investigate the use of force in Portland and whether federal agents had proper identification.\nBlack Lives Matter activists, who have led protests against police brutality in Chicago, are suing federal officials to try to ensure agents do not violate civil rights.

Now, reluctantly he is backing it.\nA woman walks in a pedestrian precinct in Helensburgh, Scotland, Britain, July 22, 2020. REUTERS/Russell Cheyne\nThe 71-year-old former marine engineer voted against Scotland leaving the United Kingdom during the last independence referendum in 2014. But after Brexit, the election of Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the coronavirus pandemic, he now believes Scotland would be better off independent.\nHenderson lives in Helensburgh, a coastal town on the Firth of Clyde, which is an unlikely home for Scottish nationalists.\nThe area has one of the highest levels of English residents living in Scotland, and everyone knows someone who works at the nearby Faslane nuclear submarine base, a symbol of the shared bonds that bind the United Kingdom.\nThe base is the second-largest single site employer in Scotland and red-white-and-blue union jack flags fly in some residents\u2019 gardens. If Scotland wins independence and the nationalists fulfil a promise to remove the submarines from its waters, thousands of jobs are at risk.\nBut Scottish nationalism is rising in places like this and other former unionist strongholds, a phenomenon which could tip the scales in favour of the break-up of the centuries-old political union between Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom.\n\u201cIndependence is probably inevitable now - I don\u2019t mean to sound dramatic,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cI just feel like we are drifting apart and Scotland can run itself better.\u201d\nThe coronavirus pandemic is straining the bonds that bind together the United Kingdom. In Scotland, where this is most visible, 54% of people now favour independence, according a recent poll, driven by a perception that Scotland\u2019s semi-autonomous government has handled the coronavirus outbreak better than the United Kingdom government.\nUnder the United Kingdom\u2019s devolved system agreed towards the end of the last century, each country has responsibility for matters such as health, while the government in London is responsible for handling the broader economy and foreign policy.\nAll the nations of the United Kingdom - England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - went into lockdown at roughly the same time. But they have emerged at different speeds, a divergence that reflects concerns that Johnson\u2019s government, having gone into lockdown too late, is exiting prematurely.\nNicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister and head of the pro-independence Scottish National Party, has been widely praised for her handling of the crisis, including among those who voted to remain part of the United Kingdom in the 2014 independence referendum.\nSturgeon has won plaudits for her honesty, grasp of detail and adopting a more cautious approach to lifting lockdown restrictions. Scotland has not recorded any deaths from people who tested positive for coronavirus in the last week.

Now, reluctantly he is backing it.\nA woman walks in a pedestrian precinct in Helensburgh, Scotland, Britain, July 22, 2020. REUTERS/Russell Cheyne\nThe 71-year-old former marine engineer voted against Scotland leaving the United Kingdom during the last independence referendum in 2014. But after Brexit, the election of Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the coronavirus pandemic, he now believes Scotland would be better off independent.\nHenderson lives in Helensburgh, a coastal town on the Firth of Clyde, which is an unlikely home for Scottish nationalists.\nThe area has one of the highest levels of English residents living in Scotland, and everyone knows someone who works at the nearby Faslane nuclear submarine base, a symbol of the shared bonds that bind the United Kingdom.\nThe base is the second-largest single site employer in Scotland and red-white-and-blue union jack flags fly in some residents\u2019 gardens. If Scotland wins independence and the nationalists fulfil a promise to remove the submarines from its waters, thousands of jobs are at risk.\nBut Scottish nationalism is rising in places like this and other former unionist strongholds, a phenomenon which could tip the scales in favour of the break-up of the centuries-old political union between Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom.\n\u201cIndependence is probably inevitable now - I don\u2019t mean to sound dramatic,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cI just feel like we are drifting apart and Scotland can run itself better.\u201d\nThe coronavirus pandemic is straining the bonds that bind together the United Kingdom. In Scotland, where this is most visible, 54% of people now favour independence, according a recent poll, driven by a perception that Scotland\u2019s semi-autonomous government has handled the coronavirus outbreak better than the United Kingdom government.\nUnder the United Kingdom\u2019s devolved system agreed towards the end of the last century, each country has responsibility for matters such as health, while the government in London is responsible for handling the broader economy and foreign policy.\nAll the nations of the United Kingdom - England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - went into lockdown at roughly the same time. But they have emerged at different speeds, a divergence that reflects concerns that Johnson\u2019s government, having gone into lockdown too late, is exiting prematurely.\nNicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister and head of the pro-independence Scottish National Party, has been widely praised for her handling of the crisis, including among those who voted to remain part of the United Kingdom in the 2014 independence referendum.\nSturgeon has won plaudits for her honesty, grasp of detail and adopting a more cautious approach to lifting lockdown restrictions.

It holds the memories of their life together: their first date six years ago, kissing in front of a pro-democracy \u201cLennon wall\u201d; the tattooed bands on their ring fingers, symbolizing a bond not easily erased; and their wedding day last year, when he vowed to her, \u201cNot even a nuclear explosion could break us apart.\u201d\nElaine To, 41, and her husband Henry Tong, 38, who are facing rioting charges after they were arrested at an anti-extradition bill protest, pose for a photograph after getting married in Hong Kong, China, August 4, 2019. The placard reads \"Together we go, together we leave.\". REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File Photo\nThe book doesn\u2019t mention the 50 hours that Henry and Elaine spent in jail in July last year, just four days before their wedding. Arrested at a pro-democracy protest, the couple were kept in different cells at the police station, separated by a long corridor and a large wall.\nNot knowing if they\u2019d get out in time for their wedding, the couple tried to stay together by shouting across the cells.\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t see each other. But if we yelled loud enough, we could listen to each other\u2019s voices,\u201d Elaine said.\nEarly this year, Henry, 39, spent more than a month putting together the photo book in secret during the couple\u2019s rare times apart. He wanted Elaine, 42, to have something to remind her of him in case they were separated again, this time for years.\nNearly a year after they were first arrested, the newlyweds were tried on charges of rioting, an offense carrying a penalty of up to 10 years in jail. The couple spoke to Reuters in the weeks leading up to the court ruling in their case. On Friday, they learned their fate.\nSince June of last year, more than 9,000 people have been arrested during the protests, which saw millions of people take to the streets with five demands, including retracting the classification of protesters as \u201crioters\u201d and full democracy in the Chinese-ruled territory. More than 650 have been accused of rioting, one of the most serious charges. Their cases delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the accused are finally facing verdicts just weeks after China dramatically intensified its crackdown by imposing new national security legislation on Hong Kong that includes life in prison for some political crimes.\nBeijing\u2019s move has exacerbated concerns among many Hong Kong residents over the loss of freedoms in the city, including freedom of speech and the press. Critics say the law marks the end of Hong Kong\u2019s \u201cone country, two systems\u201d governing model, which afforded the city a high degree of autonomy ever since its hand-over from British to Chinese rule in 1997. China says the new legislation targets only a minority of \u201ctroublemakers\u201d in the city, and Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, Carrie Lam, called opponents of the law \u201cthe enemy of the Hong Kong people.\u201d\nLam has defended the crackdown on last year\u2019s protesters, who took to the streets to oppose a bill that would have allowed extradition of people from Hong Kong to the mainland. \u201cI must urge everyone once again \u2013 don\u2019t break the law, especially young people,\u201d she said in May. \u201cThere is a heavy price for breaking the law.\u201d\nMuch older than the teenagers who came to symbolize the demonstrations, Henry and Elaine insist they were merely providing first aid to those who were tear-gassed on that day of protests last July. The couple, who own a gym in Hong Kong\u2019s Sheung Wan neighborhood, pleaded not guilty. They say they never went anywhere near the front lines, and never acted violently or illegally.\nTheir lawyer argued in court that there was no direct evidence proving they were on the street where the alleged riot happened; CCTV footage showed them in an alley nearby and leaving the area. The court testimony also showed that only umbrellas, protective gear, medical supplies and two walkie-talkies were seized in their arrest.\nThe prosecution said in court that even though there was no evidence showing that the couple was present at the point where the rioting took place, they shared the goals of those participating in the rioting. Their gear and the fact they were running away from the police, the prosecution said, supported the accusation that they had been involved in rioting.\nThe couple\u2019s lawyer countered that they were avoiding tear gas, not running away.\nHenry said he and Elaine \u201cnever imagined\u201d they would be arrested. \u201cWe never thought we would need to find a lawyer, or who would take care of our dogs.\u201d\nElaine cried sometimes when talking about the separation she felt was sure to come \u2013 and fretted over what would happen to the couple\u2019s three dogs, who are like children to them, a source of both worry and wonder. But she said she believed it was her responsibility to stand up for Hong Kong\u2019s future.\n\u201cWhen I look back at my life, what made me proud?\u201d she said. \u201cI really think that even though I was arrested, I don\u2019t regret standing up. I am scared of being jailed, but I don\u2019t regret it.\u201d\nGOING THROUGH FIRE AND WATER TOGETHER\nDuring the demonstrations, protesters gave Henry the nickname Fu Tong, which means \u201cto go through water.\u201d Elaine was nicknamed Dou Fo, which means \u201cto go through fire.\u201d Literally, the names mean they\u2019ll go through fire and water together.\nThey were among the first to be charged with rioting during the protests last year, arrested with a 17-year-old named Natalie Lee. The couple also faced an additional charge of possessing a radio apparatus without a valid license.\nHenry and Elaine said they didn\u2019t know Natalie before the arrest. Police were firing rounds of tear gas at the time they found Natalie in an alley, having a hard time breathing and barely able to open her eyes, they said. After helping Natalie to rinse her eyes with saline water, the couple said they tried to leave the scene. The trio were arrested by riot police in front of a barbed-wire fence and were tried together. Natalie, who also pleaded not guilty, declined to comment when contacted by Reuters ahead of the court ruling.\nTheir detention at the police station was one of the toughest moments in their relationship, the couple said. They\u2019ve been inseparable since they started dating in 2014, when protesters paralyzed major roads of the financial hub for 79 days late that year demanding full democracy for the city.\nAll Henry could think about was their wedding, just days away. \u201cThe scariest thing about the arrest was that I couldn\u2019t get married on time. The police officers kept telling us that there was no plan to grant us bail,\u201d he said. \u201cThe first thing I told my lawyer was to make sure we could be bailed out and get married.\u201d\nOnce they secured bail and were finally out, they were overwhelmed by all the things they needed to handle \u2013 comforting their dogs; apologizing to their clients for canceling gym classes while they were being held; finding a suit for Henry to wear in court.\nWaking up the morning after their release, they were nervous about appearing in court for the first time. And then they saw the scene outside the courthouse.\nEven with a typhoon approaching the city and rain lashing down, hundreds of supporters had gathered outside Eastern Court, some of them covered only by plastic bags, to show solidarity.\nMany held placards that read, \u201cThere are no rioters, only tyranny,\u201d and kept chanting \u201cLiberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time,\u201d until all 44 people who appeared in court that day were granted bail in the afternoon.\nHenry and Elaine didn\u2019t know all of the people who had gathered to support them, and many of the supporters didn\u2019t know them.\n\u201cIt had nothing to do with them, but they stayed put and waited for us under the tropical rainstorm,\u201d Henry said, wiping tears away. \u201cThe scene really overwhelmed us. We stopped feeling nervous by the time we entered the court.\u201d\n\u2018I WILL CONTINUE TO LOVE YOU FOREVER\u2019\nFour days later, Elaine wore her white wedding dress at a tiny marriage hall of the Cotton Tree Drive Marriage Registry in the Central district.\nThey only expected four people, including the two witnesses, to come to their wedding ceremony. Henry didn\u2019t even invite his family, because the couple had received online threats that someone would gatecrash and spoil their wedding, and guests might be doxxed online.\nSlideshow ( 28 images )\nTo their surprise, dozens of family members, friends and people they hadn\u2019t even met before showed up that day. Journalists also came and live-streamed their ceremony on social media as if it were a royal wedding, not of two people accused of a serious crime.\n\u201cThe general impression of Hong Kongers toward criminals is very bad, and rioting is a very serious charge, but they still came. It really showcases the love of Hong Kongers,\u201d Henry said. \u201cI am very touched and proud.\u201d\nWhen the wedding was about to begin, an older stranger suddenly opened the door.\nJust as Henry and Elaine thought he was there to interfere with the wedding, he instead gave them traditional red envelopes of money as a gift, saying, \u201cCongratulations. Congratulations.\u201d\nRather than exchange rings, they tattooed a pair of boxing gloves with Mexican-style, ornamental bride-and-groom skulls on their toned, muscled arms linked by two strings to the tattooed bands on their left ring fingers. It symbolised how they came across each other through a Thai boxing class and fell in love until death do them part.\n\u201cIf you want to wash away the tattoo, you need to go through a lot of pain; it\u2019s very similar to the meaning of marriage,\u201d Henry said.\nAfter signing the papers, each gave a short speech as they held each other\u2019s hands tightly.\n\u201cAlthough there are some obstacles in the road, I have finally become Mrs. Tong. I will go through the upheaval with you,\u201d Elaine vowed during the ceremony as she wept.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to find someone in life with the same ideals, values, and willing to go through ups and downs with you in the time of chaos... I will continue to love you forever,\u201d Henry said before they exchanged a kiss.\nJust a week after the ceremony, street posters with their wedding photo and the words \u201ctrash teens\u201d \u2013 a derogatory term hurled at pro-democracy protesters \u2013 were pasted near their gym and on lamp posts from Sheung Wan more than a mile to the Admiralty district. But neither of them took it seriously, they say. In fact, Elaine laughs about the teen description: \u201cThat means we are still young.\u201d\n\u2018YOU ARE NEVER ALONE\u2019\nTheir trial was scheduled to start in March but was postponed because of the pandemic. The 20 days the court took to hear their case exceeded the original estimate by 10 days.\nSharron Fast is a lecturer in media law at the University of Hong Kong and once taught criminal law at the law school there. She says the city\u2019s riot law is dated and hasn\u2019t been reformed since 1976.\n\u201cThe elements of the offense are that as soon as three or more people in an unlawful demonstration commit certain acts, that is to say a \u2018breach of the peace,\u2019 they are said to be riotously assembled,\u201d Fast said. \u201cEveryone present is deemed to be a party to the riot, regardless of the role he or she played.\u201d\nShe said that the large number of protest-related cases means that achieving justice may be difficult. \u201cIt is hard to imagine that all these individuals will receive adequate due process in a sense that the trials are very time-consuming on a case-by-case basis,\u201d she said.\nCarrie Lam\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond to questions from Reuters about the judicial process.\nThe Hong Kong Department of Justice told Reuters it would study the case to determine if any \u201cfollow-up action is called for\u201d.\nHenry sometimes blamed himself for the couple\u2019s legal predicament.\n\u201cI am really thankful to her. It was never her idea. I am more stubborn,\u201d he said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t blame me for getting us into the current situation.\u201d\nThe psychological pressure of the past year has left Henry plagued by nightmares. On the evening before the court ruling, he was gloomy. \u201cRight now it\u2019s like watching my own funeral, watching people watching my death,\u201d he said. \u201cExcept I am not dead. It\u2019s very hard.\u201d\nThe court case has also hurt the couple\u2019s business. They say they\u2019ve lost two-thirds of their income because of political differences with their clients.\n\u201cMost of our remaining clients are supportive of us. They told us: \u2018It\u2019s OK. Although you were charged, we will still come,\u2019\u201d Elaine said.\nWhenever they felt defeated, they took out the wedding gifts and cards they received and went through the messages inscribed on them.\nOne of their favorites was a drawing that three children did of Elaine in a wedding gown and Henry in a wedding suit with a yellow helmet, the color denoting support for the protest movement. They\u2019ve hung it up at the entrance of their gym.\n\u201cThank you for fighting for justice for the young generation, you are never alone, you have us who will stand with you. Happy Marriage! Proud of Mr. and Mrs. Tong!\u201d the children wrote.\n\u201cThey remind us that we should keep going,\u201d Henry said.\nReferring to the new security law imposed by Beijing, he added: \u201cEven though Hong Kong doesn\u2019t have a future anymore, I am still hopeful. We are not alone.\u201d\nIn the days leading up to the verdict, the couple counted down their time at the gym, where they spent most of their days building their dream together.\nThey asked a friend to take over the company. They packed their boxing gloves and two large plastic sheets with the company logo, \u201cWild Gym,\u201d into bags.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the place that made it special, but the time we spent together that made it special,\u201d Henry said.\nThey also treasured moments like running and walking their dogs, whom they adopted three years ago: a poodle named Ah Mui (Sister) and two mongrels named Fa Fa (Flower) and Cho Cho (Grass).\nLike worried parents, they mentioned their dogs again and again when talking about the specter of imprisonment, worrying the pets would stop eating without them, like when the couple were detained at the police station.\nThey made plans for the dogs. Elaine\u2019s mother, who has been supportive of them during their legal troubles, would look after Ah Mui, because the poodle has skin allergies that need to be taken care of.\nFa Fa and Cho Cho are both large dogs, and the couple worried that Elaine\u2019s mother might get injured when she walked them. So they planned to send them to their dog trainer\u2019s pet hotel where they would stay with other dogs to ease their separation anxiety.\nElaine tattooed all three pets on her right arm in case she was imprisoned, saying, \u201cAt least I can see my dogs.\u201d\nElaine\u2019s mother, Ann, 60, said she sometimes wished she could go back in time and change everything. She noticed that they became quiet at home as the verdict approached, sometimes sitting in dead silence, but she didn\u2019t dare ask much. She broke down, sobbing, when she talked about her daughter and son-in-law.\n\u201cMommy really supports both of you,\u201d she said she told them. \u201cNo matter what happens, I will support both of you and take care of the dogs.\u201d\nHenry hoped the couple could remain strong.\n\u201cI hope that no matter how bad the situation will be, we won\u2019t lose faith. I hope our love can continue in this chaotic time,\u201d he said. \u201cThese words are not just for our marriage but also for Hong Kong.\u201d\nOn Friday, about 100 people gathered outside the court to support the couple ahead of the ruling in their case. Inside, Elaine cried while Henry sat silently, staring at the wall.\nIn an instant, all the couple\u2019s dread about a life apart behind bars melted away. As they stood in the courthouse, the judge announced they had been acquitted of the rioting charge. So had Natalie Lee. The couple were found guilty of the lesser offense of possessing a wireless radio without a permit and fined $1,300 each. They were free to go.\nElaine and Henry wept and embraced. Then Elaine hugged her mother, apologizing for the worry she had caused her.\n\u201cThey are good people,\u201d said Ann. \u201cThey did nothing wrong.\u201d\nHenry said they would head home immediately to take care of the dogs, while Elaine said they would start to unpack their gym equipment and get back to work.\nIn the days before the verdict and sentencing, the couple had paged through the photo book that Henry made for Elaine.\nOn the last page, he had written, \u201chappily ever after,\u201d like every fairy tale.\nReporting by Jessie Pang in Hong Kong.

(Reuters) - Federal agents fired tear gas canisters at Black Lives Matter demonstrators in downtown Portland early on Friday in a 56th straight day of protests, amid growing scrutiny over the use of border patrol officers in the city.\n Positioned behind a steel fence, agents began firing tear gas after a small group of protesters, many helmeted and wearing face masks, lit a fire at the entrance of the building shortly after midnight.\nSaying they were being hit with projectiles and lasers, federal agents declared an unlawful assembly and forced protesters back up a block from the federal courthouse.\nThe agents then retreated to a different corner of the courthouse and confronted protesters there, lobbing more canisters that bounced off the walls of buildings into protesters.

I do not know what I could be using to buy kerosene if I had not installed this solar unit.\u201d\nWith extreme weather and the economic impact of COVID-19 plunging many Kenyans into darkness, alternative energy sources are increasingly important - even for families connected to the grid, said Pamela Mukami Njeru, a community health volunteer in the central Mt. Kenya region.\nOne in four Kenyans - mostly in rural areas - do not have access to electricity. Those who do face high costs and frequent blackouts due to an unreliable supply.\nAs cases of the novel coronavirus continue to climb in Kenya, the lack of reliable power can be a matter of life and death, said Njeru, whose work involves taking patients with urgent health problems to and from hospital.\n\u201cWithout a power source, families facing an emergency are not able to keep their mobile phones charged to call us. This is how having a solar unit which can supply power all day and night can save lives,\u201d she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nIn early May, Kenya suffered a nationwide blackout that lasted about six hours, and the following month, more than 20 counties lost electricity for about 10 hours.\nBernard Ngugi, managing director of the Kenya Power and Lighting Company, told reporters in June that the blackouts were the result of work being done by the company to replace damaged power lines or to upgrade the network to connect new customers.\nSLOW START\nWanja had hoped to be one of them. She applied for an electricity connection in 2016, but local officials said her application was turned down because she lived too far from the main road.\nWorried the kerosene lamps she used for lighting could cause a fire or the toxic fumes would harm her children\u2019s health, she decided to put some of her savings into buying a solar system.\nNow she has power through the blackouts, she saves the dollar a week she used to spend on kerosene and her children can study safely, she said.\n\u201cSometimes I would even take the tin lamp to use in the kitchen, leaving my children in darkness.

I do not know what I could be using to buy kerosene if I had not installed this solar unit.\u201d\nWith extreme weather and the economic impact of COVID-19 plunging many Kenyans into darkness, alternative energy sources are increasingly important - even for families connected to the grid, said Pamela Mukami Njeru, a community health volunteer in the central Mt. Kenya region.\nOne in four Kenyans - mostly in rural areas - do not have access to electricity. Those who do face high costs and frequent blackouts due to an unreliable supply.\nAs cases of the novel coronavirus continue to climb in Kenya, the lack of reliable power can be a matter of life and death, said Njeru, whose work involves taking patients with urgent health problems to and from hospital.\n\u201cWithout a power source, families facing an emergency are not able to keep their mobile phones charged to call us. This is how having a solar unit which can supply power all day and night can save lives,\u201d she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nIn early May, Kenya suffered a nationwide blackout that lasted about six hours, and the following month, more than 20 counties lost electricity for about 10 hours.\nBernard Ngugi, managing director of the Kenya Power and Lighting Company, told reporters in June that the blackouts were the result of work being done by the company to replace damaged power lines or to upgrade the network to connect new customers.\nSLOW START\nWanja had hoped to be one of them. She applied for an electricity connection in 2016, but local officials said her application was turned down because she lived too far from the main road.\nWorried the kerosene lamps she used for lighting could cause a fire or the toxic fumes would harm her children\u2019s health, she decided to put some of her savings into buying a solar system.\nNow she has power through the blackouts, she saves the dollar a week she used to spend on kerosene and her children can study safely, she said.\n\u201cSometimes I would even take the tin lamp to use in the kitchen, leaving my children in darkness. But now I do not have to because there is solar lighting in my kitchen,\u201d Wanja said.\nIf more Kenyans switched to solar, the move could also help curb climate change, according to a 2018 report by Stockholm Environment Institute Africa researchers.\nReplacing smoky fuels such as kerosene, wood and charcoal with solar energy could help reduce emissions in Kenya by 1.8 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2030, it said.\nIn 2015, less than 1% of Kenya\u2019s electricity came from solar - with most generated from fossil fuels, hydropower and geothermal energy - but the country has the potential to push that up to more than 7% by 2030, the report added.\nThe researchers linked the slow uptake of solar energy to high investment costs in recent years, noting that upfront costs involved in generating one kilowatt of energy from solar were more than three times as much as those for hydropower.\n\u201cWe have the solutions and we have the technologies.

The NFL\u2019s plan is for the season to begin as scheduled on Sept. 10, with concessions being made for a shortened preseason that could include just one game per team.\nLast week, Sills said he \u201cabsolutely expects\u201d widespread positive tests in training camp.\nPlayers collectively posted their push for the NFL to focus on player safety, underscoring their desire to play this season, on Sunday.\nDrew Brees, J.J. Watt, Patrick Mahomes and Russell Wilson all posted similar messages with the hashtag #WeWantToPlay.\n\u201cWhat you are seeing today is our guys standing up for each other and for the work their union leadership has done to keep everyone as safe as possible,\u201d NFL Players Association president J.C. Tretter posted on Twitter. \u201cThe NFL needs to listen to our union and adopt the experts\u2019 recommendations.\u201d\nIn a memo sent to teams on Saturday, the league said camps would open as scheduled. Rookies are to report on Tuesday, quarterbacks and injured players are to report two days later, and all other players are to report on July 28.\n--Field Level Media\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"url": "/article/idUSKBN2400XO", "headline": "Special Report: Into the fog - How Britain lost track of the coronavirus", "published_date": "2020-07-20", "text": "By Stephen Grey, Andrew MacAskill, Ryan McNeill, Steve Stecklow, Tommy Wilkes\n35 MIN READ\nLONDON (Reuters) - On Friday, Feb. 21, Duncan Selbie, chief executive of Public Health England, was in a cheerful mood. It was near the end of the school half-term holiday.\nFILE PHOTO: Workers in protective suits disinfect a waiting hall at the Wuhan Railway Station which has been closed due to the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, in Wuhan, Hubei province, China March 24, 2020. cnsphoto via REUTERS/File Photo. To match Special Report HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/BRITAIN-TRACING ATTENTION EDITORS - THIS IMAGE WAS PROVIDED BY A THIRD PARTY. CHINA OUT.\nHe wrote on an official blog that there had been no new positive cases of the new coronavirus that week in the United Kingdom. It was a \u201ctestament,\u201d he said, \u201cto the robust infection control measures\u201d and the \u201cdiagnostic and testing work\u201d at laboratories nationwide.\nSelbie, who joked when he took his then \u00a3185,000-a-year job in 2013 that his public health credentials could be fitted \u201con a postage stamp,\u201d headed a government agency with a mission to prepare for and respond to public health emergencies. He was now facing an epochal one.\nPublic Health England (PHE) is a cornerstone of the UK\u2019s state-run health system; Selbie reports directly to the government\u2019s health minister, Matt Hancock.\nThe agency is much smaller and has a lower profile than the vast National Health Service (NHS) that oversees Britain\u2019s hospitals, clinics and general practitioners, providing healthcare to all. Public Health England\u2019s 5,500 staff have an important supporting role running laboratories, developing tests for new infections and managing outbreaks in England, home to 56 million of the UK\u2019s 67 million people.\nEven as Selbie posted his blog, all was not well. Reuters estimates that across the UK between 1,500 and 5,000 people may already have been infected with the coronavirus. The estimate is based on current scientific assessments of the fatality rate from COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, and an average interval from infection to death of between 18 and 23 days.\nWithin five weeks of Selbie\u2019s blog, Britain had hit the peak of an outbreak that has caused at least 43,000 deaths so far, according to the official toll. This compares to 35,000 in Italy, the first country in Europe to be severely affected, or nearly 9,000 in Germany, where, in the early days, the spread of infection appeared similar to Britain. With the exception only of Belgium, Britain has the highest per-capita mortality rate from COVID-19 among major economies, Reuters data show.\nAs Reuters has reported previously, Britain was slow to impose lockdown measures. That delay was costly. Professor Neil Ferguson, a disease modelling expert from Imperial College, London, has said that introducing lockdown measures a week earlier \u201cwould have reduced the final death toll by at least half.\u201d\nNow, a Reuters investigation reveals further missteps and failures by officials and government agencies, including Selbie\u2019s Public Health England, in testing, tracking and tracing. Among decisions that doctors and epidemiologists say cost lives were:\n\u2022 Failure to build up capacity to perform mass tests for COVID-19.\n\u2022 Deciding on a narrower definition of COVID-19 than used by the World Health Organization and other countries.\n\u2022 A decision to abandon testing of most people who didn\u2019t require hospitalization, and failure, early on, to create any way to track infection.\n\u2022 A decision to abandon a programme of widespread \u201ccontact tracing,\u201d in which people in contact with an infected person were traced and told to isolate to stop the outbreak spreading.\n\u2022 Deciding to share almost no details about the location of infections with local public health officials or the public.\n\u2022 Fragmenting local responsibility for public health.\n\u201cEvery mistake that was made did, unfortunately, cost lives,\u201d said Professor Tim Spector, an epidemiologist at King\u2019s College London.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has said his government followed scientific advice at all times. Ministers point out that from mid-April, the UK dramatically increased the number of tests carried out and recruited thousands of contact tracers to control outbreaks.\nIn a statement, Public Health England chief executive Selbie told Reuters his agency\u2019s work had helped to save lives. \u201cBeating this virus was always going to be a marathon not a sprint,\u201d Selbie said. \u201cIt remains our sole focus and we have done our absolute best with all our available resources.\u201d\nStill, as the country began emerging from its lockdown this month, there was another blow to the government. It was forced to delay until at least autumn a contact-tracing app that it had hoped would be a game changer in tracking the virus and averting a second wave of infection. It emerged the app didn\u2019t work properly with iPhones.\nINTO THE FOG\nOnce it surfaced, the virus spread rapidly in Britain. Infections peaked weeks earlier than the authorities expected not just in England, but in all parts of the UK.\nEngland\u2019s Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s top health adviser, recently conceded, \u201cMany of the problems we had came because we were unable to actually work out exactly where we were, and we were trying to see our way through the fog.\u201d\nSeveral senior doctors, who led the response to COVID-19 at major hospitals, told Reuters the fog was partly a result of early decisions by Whitty and other advisers that restricted testing for the virus. The doctors asked not to be named because they were not authorised by the NHS to speak publicly.\nPublic Health England had two main ways of monitoring and controlling the virus: a programme of testing and one of contact tracing to track down the contacts of anyone with the infection. These methods depended on what doctors call a \u201ccase definition,\u201d the description of what a COVID-19 case looks like, to determine who should be tested.\nIn early February, the World Health Organization listed eight symptoms for COVID-19, including nausea and vomiting. In Germany, the government\u2019s disease-control agency, the Robert Koch Institute, said doctors should use their judgment in ordering tests and it encouraged tests even for those with \u201cunspecified general symptoms,\u201d meaning mild symptoms.\nBritain took a different course. Whitty and his colleagues adopted a narrower view, defining COVID-19 symptoms as only a sharp new cough, fever or shortness of breath. Britain clung to this definition through the peak of the outbreak. It was not updated until May 18 \u2013 after 34,796 deaths \u2013 when a loss of taste and smell was added to the symptom list.\nSpector, the King\u2019s College professor, said Britain\u2019s refusal to recognize more symptoms created space for the virus to spread. Because testing was restricted to people exhibiting the UK\u2019s narrow range of symptoms, many cases likely went unnoticed and the virus spread unchecked.\n\u201cThe country that invented epidemiology was the only one that had no surveillance programme and no idea what was going on in their own country,\u201d he told Reuters.\nSeveral senior doctors said they had pleaded with the authorities to expand the case definition. But they got nowhere.\nOne London consultant said a Public Health England laboratory refused to accept test samples from patients who didn\u2019t meet the UK definition. Asked if this was true, a Public Health England spokesman said: \u201cThat is right, but there is nothing unusual in this. Lab testing capacity was used to establish whether people that met the case definition had the virus.\u201d\nBritain also restricted testing in other ways. At first it would test only those who had come into contact with confirmed cases and those with symptoms who had travelled from Wuhan, China, the origin of the outbreak, then from February 1 the rest of China, and six days later from other parts of Asia. Parts of Italy, the first European country to be badly hit by the virus, and Iran were added on February 25. Others were excluded.\n\u201cWe were testing all these people with a cough from China and parts of Asia,\u201d said one senior doctor at a London teaching hospital, but meanwhile cases from other countries passed unnoticed.\nCommunity testing in London, using the narrow guidelines, found only roughly 50 positive cases among some 5,000 tested by mid-March, another infectious disease specialist doctor in the capital said. Reuters has estimated that more than 18,000 Londoners were or had been infected with the virus by the end of February.\n\u201cA lot of us felt it was looking for a needle in a haystack,\u201d this doctor said.\nA large genetic study would later show that most UK infections had come from Europe, not Asia. Beginning in early February, the virus strain could be traced back to Italy, then Spain and France, a team from the University of Oxford and University of Edinburgh found.\nMany frontline doctors believe the disease was carried home to Britain from Europe\u2019s ski resorts. The biggest influx was when families returned from their half-term break, shortly after Selbie\u2019s February 21 blog post that celebrated recording no further cases.\nPublic Health England told Reuters it didn\u2019t set policy. The Department of Health and Social Care, Britain\u2019s health ministry, said the case definition was set by the government\u2019s top medical advisers, based on scientific advice. The definition was continually reviewed, the ministry said. \u201cThe symptoms selected were those that captured those most likely to have COVID-19, while not capturing a great number of people who did not,\u201d the department said in a response to Reuters.\nIn Scotland, which followed the same UK-wide case definition, there were also far more early cases than realised. In the Glasgow region, for instance, Reuters calculated there were at least 200 cases by the end of February. But, according to official data, there were no cases.\nWHO\u2019S IN CHARGE\nThe government would later concede the UK hadn\u2019t tested enough. Matt Hancock, the health minister, blamed a shortage of lab capacity. \u201cWe have the best scientific labs in the world, but we did not have the scale,\u201d he said in April. Germany, in contrast, \u201ccould call upon a hundred test labs, ready and waiting when the crisis struck.\u201d He did not specify how many labs the UK had.\nBut according to Mark Reed, general manager of Pro-Lab Diagnostics, a Canadian-owned company, that wasn\u2019t the case. \u201cEvery maker of diagnostics was saying \u2018We are here.\u2019 I don\u2019t think the government engaged enough; they underestimated what was required.\u201d\nRELATED COVERAGE\nBritain's COVID-19 app: The game changer that wasn't\nReed and officials from two other diagnostic firms \u2013 Novacyt and GeneFirst Ltd \u2013 told Reuters that Public Health England evaluations of their testing kits were not completed until mid-to-late March. As a result, NHS labs were reluctant to use tests made by the three companies, they said. Public Health England told Reuters that although it carried out evaluations, it wasn\u2019t its job to approve or recommend tests. It didn\u2019t comment about these specific cases.\nBy contrast, laboratories in Germany began using commercially made tests from Jan. 27 and then validated new ones as they became available, said Evangelos Kotsopoulos, CEO at laboratory firm Sonic Healthcare Germany. Into February, \u201cwe simply grabbed every single instrument we could find,\u201d while hiring new lab staff and stockpiling crucial chemicals needed for testing.\nOf all countries, South Korea had best demonstrated the value of mass testing early in the pandemic, making use of commercially supplied kits. One, from South Korea\u2019s Seegene Inc, was not evaluated until mid-March by Public Health England. Based on that evaluation, NHS labs began purchasing and using it in early April. German labs had been using that test since mid-February.\nA spokesman for Public Health England said that, within the UK\u2019s overall strategy, the agency\u2019s role \u201cwas to provide an assured testing capability\u201d for the virus \u201cwhile commercial partners worked to develop their own capability.\u201d NHS labs were free to order and validate their own private test kits or develop their own, the agency said.\nThe heads of three NHS labs told Reuters otherwise: They said they had waited for Public Health England\u2019s evaluation before placing such orders.\nThe NHS didn\u2019t directly address a question from Reuters about the evaluation of tests by Public Health England. It said in a statement that overall policy on testing is set by the government, informed by advice from Public Health England. The statement added that \u201cas more reagent supplies became available, NHS-run laboratories were able to increase their capacity to test for COVID-19.\u201d\nThe bulk of tests for the coronavirus in the early stage of the outbreak was done within Public Health England\u2019s own labs. A clinical adviser to the government said the agency had been \u201cvery centralised\u201d and \u201cmade quite clear they are controlling all of the testing.\u201d\nAt the beginning, \u201cthe only game in town was the PHE test,\u201d agreed Allan Wilson, president of the Institute of Biomedical Science, which represents NHS laboratory staff.\nThe system wasn\u2019t designed for fast results.\nRavi Gupta, a Cambridge University professor of clinical microbiology, said patients at Cambridge\u2019s Addenbrooke\u2019s Hospital had likely infected others with the coronavirus while kept on wards waiting for test results. In the early weeks, he said, they had to wait two to four days. Gupta helped develop a 90-minute test.\nMembers of parliament\u2019s science committee criticised Public Health England in May for initially restricting testing to a small number of labs, calling it \u201cone of the most consequential\u201d decisions of the crisis. Selbie responded by stating the responsibility for testing policy lay with the government\u2019s health ministry, the Department of Health. \u201cPHE operates reference laboratories for novel and dangerous pathogens and would not be expected to operate mass testing programmes,\u201d he said.\nSILENT OUTBREAK\nIn Birmingham, the virus arrived unnoticed.\nZia Choudhry remembers his father, Mohamed Aslam Wassan, a 67-year-old retired businessman \u201cfull of love and full of energy\u201d coming home with a cough on March 15. Choudhry lived with his dad and his mother, together with his wife and children, in a house in Lozells, a district of Birmingham.\nIn the next few weeks, Wassan, remembered by some for bringing a famous snack, Bombay Mix, to the city, would die of COVID-19. So would four of his close friends, all well-known faces in the local Pakistani community. They were among at least 1,000 who would die across the city.\nUntil his father had taken ill, Choudhry recalled, there had been little sign that the epidemic had arrived. Up to that time, no death from COVID-19 had been recorded in this city of just over one million people. The city council had just issued a press release confirming a total of five local cases, and reminding citizens \u201cthe risk to the general public remains low.\u201d\nBut the infection had already been seeded. By Reuters calculations, based on later deaths, about 29,000 people were infected in Birmingham by that point.\nThere were grim days that followed. Eight days after his infection, Wassan was hospitalized. He was put on a ventilator the next day, and it was turned off after five more days. Choudhry could not attend his father\u2019s funeral.\nChoudhry believes the advice to socially isolate by staying at home, which did not come until March 23, should have come earlier. His father had been healthy enough to live much longer, he thinks. \u201cYou know, it was not his time,\u201d he said.\nSpeaking at a press conference in early June, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it was still too early to draw conclusions about early decisions. \u201cAll such judgments will need to be examined in the fullness of time,\u201d he said.\nIn interviews, seven directors of public health at large local authorities told Reuters they received little more information than the government released to the public on its website. The directors, who are employed by local authorities, not by Public Health England, said this lack of communication hampered their efforts to prevent the virus spreading.\n\u201cWe were flying blind,\u201d said Lisa McNally, director of public health in Sandwell, a district neighbouring Birmingham.\nMcNally said the government refused to share models used by its scientific advisers and the data that fed them. They wouldn\u2019t reveal, for example, how many people from her area were calling the NHS helpline with COVID-19 symptoms. If local officials had been kept informed there could have been special efforts to work out the source of infection, or an information campaign aimed at a particular area to reinforce the lockdown.\n\u201cWe basically would have done contact tracing,\u201d she said.\nLouise Smith, the director of health in the rural county of Norfolk, in eastern England, was angry that mortality and case data weren\u2019t shared by local hospitals. From March to mid-April, she said, \u201cI was finding out about the deaths by reading the local newspaper.\u201d\nIn Birmingham, the city\u2019s health director Justin Varney said when the first deaths occurred in early March, the national protocol was to get a personal call from Chris Whitty or his deputy. Varney\u2019s first call came from another official. He was given neither a name nor postcode of the victim. It was just the \u201cbarest minimum of details\u201d and he was told \u201cnot do anything with that until the NHS announced it.\u201d\nWhitty did not respond to a request for comment.\nAnd the information blackout continued. Throughout most of the outbreak, Birmingham\u2019s Varney, like other public health directors, was given no more detail about deaths and infections than was published on national websites, with the exception of information about outbreaks in nursing homes or other institutions. A breakdown of deaths by neighbourhood, which would have identified clusters like in Lozells, was not released until May 1.\nSecrecy was pervasive. Dr Helen Carter, Public Health England\u2019s deputy director in the Midlands, revealed in a May 15 memo to Birmingham councillors that the government had initially ordered the agency not to share with local councils its surveillance reports containing data about notified cases from local hospital emergency rooms and general practitioners.\n\u201cUntil April 2020 PHE was not permitted to share the surveillance reports with local partners by the Cabinet Office,\u201d she wrote in the memo, which is reported here for the first time. After April, information was shared with public health directors, but the reports remained official secrets and were \u201cmarked as official sensitive and not in the public domain,\u201d said the memo, which was reviewed by Reuters.\nPublic Health England declined requests by Reuters to interview Carter or any member of its staff involved in contact tracing. A spokesman said some of its surveillance reports were classified as \u201cofficial sensitive\u201d which, the spokesman said, was standard practice for non-public information. The agency had a \u201cconstant dialogue\u201d with local health directors, with \u201croutine exchanges of information and data,\u201d the spokesman added.\nThe government also restricted the power of local authorities to inform their communities about the spread of the virus. Health director Varney, who works for the city of Birmingham, said in the beginning there had been \u201ca complete embargo on local government doing proactive (communications) about COVID. At this stage, everything was being centrally controlled.\u201d\nA spokesman for the health ministry declined to respond to questions about its relationship with local health directors or its media strategy.\nIn Varney\u2019s view, communication was urgently needed to prevent misunderstandings about the virus taking hold and to target communities where many elderly people have poor English. He used a regulatory loophole to get the message out: He found he was allowed to talk about issues affecting \u201ccommunity cohesion.\u201d\nCALLING A HALT\nSophie Grenville and her husband, Mark, who manage a country estate in the county of Hampshire, took matters into their own hands.\nIt was early March when the couple tested positive for the coronavirus. She described her experiences later in a journal she shared with Reuters called \u201cA Diary of a Super Spreader.\u201d Her case illustrates the complexity and the slow pace of the early UK version of contact tracing.\nThe couple was tested for the virus after returning from a trip to Indonesia on Feb. 23. They developed what grew into a very distinctive, dry cough \u2013 like a fox or a deer barking \u2013 and reported it to the NHS helpline. They waited three days for a test. All the while, she wrote in the diary, she and her husband were thinking of the hundreds of people they recently had come into contact with at social and business events, from \u201cHigh Court judges to football chiefs.\u201d\nNurses in protective clothing visited their home on March 6 and took samples. The next day, they received the call with the positive test result, and later another call from an epidemiologist from Public Health England. Grenville said she was told the agency was only interested in people the couple had been in touch with when Grenville or her husband had recognizable symptoms.\nAt this point, Public Health England had been running a contact-tracing service for several weeks. When someone tested positive, they would get in touch and seek out potential contacts. In response to questions from Reuters, Public Health England said it couldn\u2019t comment on individual cases, but, \u201cWe followed the contact-tracing guidance that was in place at the time. This guidance stated that contacts should be traced from the point of notification of symptoms. This has changed as the knowledge of the virus has grown.\u201d Public Health England and the World Health Organization now recommend tracing contacts from two days before the onset of symptoms.\nSlideshow ( 20 images )\nEven by March, Public Health England\u2019s operation was under-resourced. Teams that usually dealt with food poisoning, measles or tuberculosis outbreaks had been drafted in.\nAccording to two senior doctors who were directly involved, the Public Health England teams were asked to cover huge regions. They didn\u2019t have the manpower to conduct serious contact tracing for measles, let alone COVID-19. Minutes of a February 18 meeting of the government\u2019s top scientific advisory committee, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), revealed that nationally Public Health England could then handle only five new cases per week. A spokesman for Public Health England told Reuters that reflected the complex international nature of early cases.\nSophie Grenville said that in her case contact tracers reached out to just two people \u2013 two sons the couple had taken out for dinner the night they had developed slight coughs. She and her husband decided to do their own contact tracing, alerting many other people they had recently encountered.\n\u201cWe were more upfront than we were advised we needed to be,\u201d Grenville said.\nShe recounted the chaotic scene in her diary: \u201cAll of Sunday we are making calls and discovering that all sorts of people we have seen have symptoms, some worse than others, and plenty we have seen are also completely fine. Everyone in our circle is having to tell their workplaces about their exposure and they are all shutting down.\u201d\nAbout 15 people the Grenvilles knew arranged to be tested, after reporting that they either had been in close contact with the couple or were exhibiting symptoms. Their farm manager tested positive, as well as a lady they had dropped in to see during the weekend, and two sons who had displayed no symptoms. Luckily, she said, none required hospitalization.\nMeanwhile, the actual source of the outbreak remained a mystery, including to Public Health England, Sophie Grenville recalled. She and her husband originally had been able to get tested because on their return from Indonesia they had changed planes in Malaysia, which was considered an early hot spot. But their symptoms hadn\u2019t developed for more than a week. That raised the possibility that they hadn\u2019t caught coronavirus in Southeast Asia, but in Britain. Scientists believe it takes up to 14 days to develop COVID-19 symptoms, but the average is four to five days.\nIndeed, on March 5, the government was told by SAGE that transmission in the community was underway. Five days later, the committee heard the UK \u201clikely has thousands of cases \u2013 as many as 5,000 to 10,000 \u2013 which are geographically spread nationally.\u201d That confirmed what many experts had suspected. Jason Strelitz, the director of public health in the east London borough of Newham, said from the end of February he began telling colleagues \u201ctime and time again\u201d to be under no illusion: official figures for COVID-19 were \u201ca massive underestimate.\u201d\nBased on analysis of the wave of deaths in the weeks that followed, and applying standard methods developed by research epidemiologists, Reuters calculates that Britain only detected about 3% of all COVID-19 infections so far, including those with no symptoms. This method may underestimate the rate of detection, however, when the epidemic spread into nursing homes and fatality rates were likely higher than average. Research by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine estimated the UK detected 18% of COVID-19 cases with clinical symptoms, compared to 43% in Germany.\nBut instead of ramping up testing and contact tracing across the country, the government brought the programme to a halt. On March 12, chief medical adviser Whitty announced from now on, \u201call of the testing capacity\u201d would be pivoted to testing people in hospital with symptoms. Anyone else who fell sick with suspected COVID-19 would have to cope \u2013 and advised not even to contact the health service unless their condition grew serious. And contact tracing was over in all but special cases, such as outbreaks in prisons or immigration centres.\nFor some who had spent their lives fighting disease, the decision to scale back contact tracing in the community came as a shock. Among them was David Heymann, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, one of the world\u2019s leading experts on infection control and a former chairman of Public Health England. He learned how to contact trace in 1976 when tracking the spread of smallpox in the slums of Kolkata, India.\nHe believes \u201cmodellers\u201d \u2014 who use data and assumptions to predict a disease\u2019s spread \u2014 carried too much weight in decisions. And they appeared to have conditioned policymakers, he felt, to believe the virus could not be stopped. \u201cI don\u2019t think any field epidemiologist would recommend to stop contact tracing in an outbreak.\u201d\nWhitty, the government\u2019s most senior medical adviser, didn\u2019t comment.\nPapers published by SAGE appear to support Heymann\u2019s suspicion that modelling scientists influenced the decision to stop routine contact tracing. SAGE\u2019s modelling committee said as early as February 3 that contact tracing \u201cis not practical once there are large numbers of cases.\u201d\nA further detailed study by three modellers from the University of Cambridge , Manchester University and Public Health England, submitted to SAGE on Feb. 12, argued that beyond a certain point in the outbreak, testing would be pointless. SAGE endorsed this paper on Feb. 18, according to published minutes, concluding that contact tracing would \u201cno longer be useful\u201d in the case of \u201csustained transmission\u201d of the virus.\nSome countries took a different approach. Just as Britain was shutting down its community tracing, Germany recruited an army of locally based contact tracers. In the southern city of Heidelberg and surrounding district of 800,000 people, local health director Rainer Schwertz told Reuters how by the second week of March, he had tripled the size of his department, recruiting 200 medical students to work on intensive tracing. By early June, just 38 people had died from COVID-19.\nA Public Health England spokesman said that contact tracing \u201cwas never abandoned.\u201d But once there was clear evidence of widespread, sustained community transmission of COVID-19, it was clear that contact tracing \u201cwas unlikely to control the outbreak alone and so was targeted where it could be most effective during this phase.\u201d The agency did not respond to a request for data showing what tracing continued.\nPublic health directors, nursing home managers and NHS staff interviewed by Reuters said they were not aware of any further tracing by Public Health England until the programme was relaunched in June.\nGOING IT ALONE\nTom Lewis, a consultant microbiologist at the Barnstaple hospital in north Devon, had spare capacity in his laboratory. He and his hospital team had tried in early April to offer testing for nursing home residents in the local community \u201cbecause nobody else was doing anything.\u201d But senior NHS executives ordered his team \u201cto back off. They said, this is not your job. This is a PHE job. So we said, \u2018fine.\u2019\u201d\nThe NHS didn\u2019t comment about the incident.\nLocal teams from Public Health England had done stellar tracing work in the early days of the outbreak, said Lewis. But then the \u201ccontract tracing stopped without really any warning and PHE then went very distant. I\u2019ve had almost no contact with PHE since then.\u201d\nHe said the agency was \u201cmassively over-stretched\u201d and it was unclear who was in charge.\nThis dysfunction was felt by some on the frontline. Roxanne Jenner-Ash, the manager of a Barnstaple nursing home, described a feeling of isolation at the height of the outbreak. \u201cThere was a point when no one wanted to support us,\u201d she said. Everyone \u2013 general practitioners, nurses and paramedics \u2013 all had different guidance and \u201ceveryone had different roles and opinions.\u201d At the same time, their residents were suffering: \u201cYou\u2019ve got people who can\u2019t feel heat, they can\u2019t make sense of what\u2019s going on, they can\u2019t communicate that they\u2019re in pain.\u201d\nAfter dealing with an outbreak in which nine residents died, Jenner-Ash was only sent swab kits to test her residents on May 9, when the infection had stopped spreading at the nursing home, at least for the time being.\nBut for Lewis the key thing was the absence of contact tracing \u2013 a real attempt to follow the spread of the virus, for example by interviewing and testing care workers who had been in contact with a COVID-positive patient, even if they had no symptoms.\nStarting in early May, Lewis and his NHS colleagues decided to launch their own wider tracing scheme. They followed contacts who tested positive at the Barnstaple hospital with the help of a sexual health adviser employed by the trust, Joanne Hamilton. Hamilton\u2019s work on sexually transmitted diseases had made her an experienced contact tracer.\nWhen another resident of her Pilton House nursing home tested positive in late May, this time, said Jenner-Ash, \u201cI was no longer alone.\u201d Within a day of the test result, Lewis and Hamilton had arranged for the entire staff of Pilton House to be tested \u2013 an exercise that uncovered a staff member who was positive and could then isolate, possibly saving the lives of others. Since then, Pilton House has remained COVID free.\nReuters learned there were small, similar experiments repeated across the country, in the highlands of Scotland, in the Lake District, in Wales, and in Sheffield, in northern England.\nBing Jones, a retired doctor who specialised in haematology, was one of a group of six retired medics who set up the Sheffield project. He said the national decision to stop contact tracing was a \u201ccatastrophic decision\u201d that has allowed the virus to travel largely unchecked across the United Kingdom and resulted in unnecessary deaths.\n\u201cIt is complete ineptitude. It was such a basic mistake. It is one of the basic planks of managing an epidemic,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was no reason why you couldn\u2019t have kept it going on a small scale or doing whatever you could.\u201d\nWorking with local general practitioners from mid-April, the group found 13 people with coronavirus symptoms, who generated 58 contacts.\nThey concluded that health and care workers may have been unwittingly passing on the virus. Judy Stewart, one of the volunteers on the Sheffield programme, said she contacted five nurses, including some who worked at a nearby hospital, to advise them to self-isolate after they were named as being in close contact with someone who had recently tested positive for COVID-19. Stewart said the nurses told her they discussed the request with their managers, but they were advised to ignore the request and keep working.\n\u201cThe resistance shocked me because of where it came from,\u201d she said. \u201cI got lots of texts back saying: \u2018sorry I can\u2019t be involved, but good luck and it was nice talking to you.\u2019\u201d\nBehind that resistance, some involved feared, was a concern among senior health service managers that too much testing and too much tracing of the contacts of healthcare workers would have \u2013 at a time of acute crisis \u2013 resulted in too many key staff taking time off work to isolate for at least the seven days mandated by the government.\nChris Morley, the chief nurse overseeing Sheffield\u2019s main hospitals, responded that the volunteer scheme was \u201cnot part of the Public Health England official Test and Trace System and our staff would therefore not necessarily have been aware of what it was or the legitimacy of the person asking them to self-isolate.\u201d\nIn London, the Francis Crick Institute, which runs a lab that has provided COVID-19 tests for hospitals, offered on April 15 to launch a programme to search for health workers who might be infected, even while showing no symptoms. University College London Hospitals conducted a month-long study of 200 healthcare workers from the end of March; 42 tested positive with the virus, but only eight had symptoms that met the official case definition. By the time of its offer, Crick had spare capacity to run at least 1,000 more tests a day.\nBut despite Crick\u2019s intensive lobbying to government ministers, NHS leaders and Selbie, the Public Health England chief, the testing programme was blocked, two sources with direct knowledge told Reuters.\nPublic Health England and the NHS referred questions about Crick\u2019s offer to the health ministry, the Department of Health, which told Reuters: \u201cThere was no guidance or instruction to NHS trusts to limit their testing programmes to hospital admissions.\u201d Increased capacity meant testing could now be extended to asymptomatic staff, a spokesperson said.\nOver the past two months, Britain finally ramped up community testing for the coronavirus and launched in late May what the prime minister called a \u201cworld-beating\u201d contact-tracing system staffed by thousands. But the new British smartphone app - heralded as a lynchpin of the contract-tracing system that was supposed to roll out last month - has been delayed. The government conceded the NHS COVID-19 App may not be ready until autumn at the earliest.\nreporting by Stephen Grey, Andrew MacAskill, Ryan McNeill, Steve Stecklow and Tommy Wilkes; additional reporting by Thomas Escritt and Paul Carrel in Berlin and Elizabeth Piper in London; edited by Janet McBride\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"url": "/article/idUSKCN24K0QU", "headline": "Hamilton criticises F1 after 'rushed' anti-racism gesture", "published_date": "2020-07-19", "text": "By Alan Baldwin\n3 MIN READ\n(Reuters) - Six times world champion Lewis Hamilton criticised Formula One\u2019s leaders after what he called a \u201crushed\u201d anti-racism gesture by some drivers before the start of Sunday\u2019s Hungarian Grand Prix.\nFormula One F1 - Hungarian Grand Prix - Hungaroring, Budapest, Hungary - July 19, 2020 Race winner Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton during a press conference after the race FIA/Handout via REUTERS\nHamilton, who won from pole position to take the championship lead after three races, again took a knee while wearing a Black Lives Matter T-shirt, but some drivers were either too late or remained standing.\nOnly eight of the 15 who turned up on time joined the only Black driver in kneeling.\n\u201cMoving forwards we need to speak to Formula One,\u201d Hamilton told Sky Sports television. \u201cThey need to do a better job.

It was near the end of the school half-term holiday.\nFILE PHOTO: Workers in protective suits disinfect a waiting hall at the Wuhan Railway Station which has been closed due to the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, in Wuhan, Hubei province, China March 24, 2020. cnsphoto via REUTERS/File Photo.

CHINA OUT.\nHe wrote on an official blog that there had been no new positive cases of the new coronavirus that week in the United Kingdom. It was a \u201ctestament,\u201d he said, \u201cto the robust infection control measures\u201d and the \u201cdiagnostic and testing work\u201d at laboratories nationwide.\nSelbie, who joked when he took his then \u00a3185,000-a-year job in 2013 that his public health credentials could be fitted \u201con a postage stamp,\u201d headed a government agency with a mission to prepare for and respond to public health emergencies. He was now facing an epochal one.\nPublic Health England (PHE) is a cornerstone of the UK\u2019s state-run health system; Selbie reports directly to the government\u2019s health minister, Matt Hancock.\nThe agency is much smaller and has a lower profile than the vast National Health Service (NHS) that oversees Britain\u2019s hospitals, clinics and general practitioners, providing healthcare to all. Public Health England\u2019s 5,500 staff have an important supporting role running laboratories, developing tests for new infections and managing outbreaks in England, home to 56 million of the UK\u2019s 67 million people.\nEven as Selbie posted his blog, all was not well. Reuters estimates that across the UK between 1,500 and 5,000 people may already have been infected with the coronavirus. The estimate is based on current scientific assessments of the fatality rate from COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, and an average interval from infection to death of between 18 and 23 days.\nWithin five weeks of Selbie\u2019s blog, Britain had hit the peak of an outbreak that has caused at least 43,000 deaths so far, according to the official toll. This compares to 35,000 in Italy, the first country in Europe to be severely affected, or nearly 9,000 in Germany, where, in the early days, the spread of infection appeared similar to Britain. With the exception only of Belgium, Britain has the highest per-capita mortality rate from COVID-19 among major economies, Reuters data show.\nAs Reuters has reported previously, Britain was slow to impose lockdown measures. That delay was costly. Professor Neil Ferguson, a disease modelling expert from Imperial College, London, has said that introducing lockdown measures a week earlier \u201cwould have reduced the final death toll by at least half.\u201d\nNow, a Reuters investigation reveals further missteps and failures by officials and government agencies, including Selbie\u2019s Public Health England, in testing, tracking and tracing. Among decisions that doctors and epidemiologists say cost lives were:\n\u2022 Failure to build up capacity to perform mass tests for COVID-19.\n\u2022 Deciding on a narrower definition of COVID-19 than used by the World Health Organization and other countries.\n\u2022 A decision to abandon testing of most people who didn\u2019t require hospitalization, and failure, early on, to create any way to track infection.\n\u2022 A decision to abandon a programme of widespread \u201ccontact tracing,\u201d in which people in contact with an infected person were traced and told to isolate to stop the outbreak spreading.\n\u2022 Deciding to share almost no details about the location of infections with local public health officials or the public.\n\u2022 Fragmenting local responsibility for public health.\n\u201cEvery mistake that was made did, unfortunately, cost lives,\u201d said Professor Tim Spector, an epidemiologist at King\u2019s College London.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has said his government followed scientific advice at all times. Ministers point out that from mid-April, the UK dramatically increased the number of tests carried out and recruited thousands of contact tracers to control outbreaks.\nIn a statement, Public Health England chief executive Selbie told Reuters his agency\u2019s work had helped to save lives. \u201cBeating this virus was always going to be a marathon not a sprint,\u201d Selbie said. \u201cIt remains our sole focus and we have done our absolute best with all our available resources.\u201d\nStill, as the country began emerging from its lockdown this month, there was another blow to the government. It was forced to delay until at least autumn a contact-tracing app that it had hoped would be a game changer in tracking the virus and averting a second wave of infection. It emerged the app didn\u2019t work properly with iPhones.\nINTO THE FOG\nOnce it surfaced, the virus spread rapidly in Britain. Infections peaked weeks earlier than the authorities expected not just in England, but in all parts of the UK.\nEngland\u2019s Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s top health adviser, recently conceded, \u201cMany of the problems we had came because we were unable to actually work out exactly where we were, and we were trying to see our way through the fog.\u201d\nSeveral senior doctors, who led the response to COVID-19 at major hospitals, told Reuters the fog was partly a result of early decisions by Whitty and other advisers that restricted testing for the virus. The doctors asked not to be named because they were not authorised by the NHS to speak publicly.\nPublic Health England had two main ways of monitoring and controlling the virus: a programme of testing and one of contact tracing to track down the contacts of anyone with the infection. These methods depended on what doctors call a \u201ccase definition,\u201d the description of what a COVID-19 case looks like, to determine who should be tested.\nIn early February, the World Health Organization listed eight symptoms for COVID-19, including nausea and vomiting. In Germany, the government\u2019s disease-control agency, the Robert Koch Institute, said doctors should use their judgment in ordering tests and it encouraged tests even for those with \u201cunspecified general symptoms,\u201d meaning mild symptoms.\nBritain took a different course. Whitty and his colleagues adopted a narrower view, defining COVID-19 symptoms as only a sharp new cough, fever or shortness of breath. Britain clung to this definition through the peak of the outbreak. It was not updated until May 18 \u2013 after 34,796 deaths \u2013 when a loss of taste and smell was added to the symptom list.\nSpector, the King\u2019s College professor, said Britain\u2019s refusal to recognize more symptoms created space for the virus to spread. Because testing was restricted to people exhibiting the UK\u2019s narrow range of symptoms, many cases likely went unnoticed and the virus spread unchecked.\n\u201cThe country that invented epidemiology was the only one that had no surveillance programme and no idea what was going on in their own country,\u201d he told Reuters.\nSeveral senior doctors said they had pleaded with the authorities to expand the case definition. But they got nowhere.\nOne London consultant said a Public Health England laboratory refused to accept test samples from patients who didn\u2019t meet the UK definition. Asked if this was true, a Public Health England spokesman said: \u201cThat is right, but there is nothing unusual in this. Lab testing capacity was used to establish whether people that met the case definition had the virus.\u201d\nBritain also restricted testing in other ways. At first it would test only those who had come into contact with confirmed cases and those with symptoms who had travelled from Wuhan, China, the origin of the outbreak, then from February 1 the rest of China, and six days later from other parts of Asia. Parts of Italy, the first European country to be badly hit by the virus, and Iran were added on February 25. Others were excluded.\n\u201cWe were testing all these people with a cough from China and parts of Asia,\u201d said one senior doctor at a London teaching hospital, but meanwhile cases from other countries passed unnoticed.\nCommunity testing in London, using the narrow guidelines, found only roughly 50 positive cases among some 5,000 tested by mid-March, another infectious disease specialist doctor in the capital said. Reuters has estimated that more than 18,000 Londoners were or had been infected with the virus by the end of February.\n\u201cA lot of us felt it was looking for a needle in a haystack,\u201d this doctor said.\nA large genetic study would later show that most UK infections had come from Europe, not Asia. Beginning in early February, the virus strain could be traced back to Italy, then Spain and France, a team from the University of Oxford and University of Edinburgh found.\nMany frontline doctors believe the disease was carried home to Britain from Europe\u2019s ski resorts. The biggest influx was when families returned from their half-term break, shortly after Selbie\u2019s February 21 blog post that celebrated recording no further cases.\nPublic Health England told Reuters it didn\u2019t set policy. The Department of Health and Social Care, Britain\u2019s health ministry, said the case definition was set by the government\u2019s top medical advisers, based on scientific advice. The definition was continually reviewed, the ministry said. \u201cThe symptoms selected were those that captured those most likely to have COVID-19, while not capturing a great number of people who did not,\u201d the department said in a response to Reuters.\nIn Scotland, which followed the same UK-wide case definition, there were also far more early cases than realised. In the Glasgow region, for instance, Reuters calculated there were at least 200 cases by the end of February. But, according to official data, there were no cases.\nWHO\u2019S IN CHARGE\nThe government would later concede the UK hadn\u2019t tested enough. Matt Hancock, the health minister, blamed a shortage of lab capacity. \u201cWe have the best scientific labs in the world, but we did not have the scale,\u201d he said in April. Germany, in contrast, \u201ccould call upon a hundred test labs, ready and waiting when the crisis struck.\u201d He did not specify how many labs the UK had.\nBut according to Mark Reed, general manager of Pro-Lab Diagnostics, a Canadian-owned company, that wasn\u2019t the case. \u201cEvery maker of diagnostics was saying \u2018We are here.\u2019 I don\u2019t think the government engaged enough; they underestimated what was required.\u201d\nRELATED COVERAGE\nBritain's COVID-19 app: The game changer that wasn't\nReed and officials from two other diagnostic firms \u2013 Novacyt and GeneFirst Ltd \u2013 told Reuters that Public Health England evaluations of their testing kits were not completed until mid-to-late March. As a result, NHS labs were reluctant to use tests made by the three companies, they said. Public Health England told Reuters that although it carried out evaluations, it wasn\u2019t its job to approve or recommend tests. It didn\u2019t comment about these specific cases.\nBy contrast, laboratories in Germany began using commercially made tests from Jan. 27 and then validated new ones as they became available, said Evangelos Kotsopoulos, CEO at laboratory firm Sonic Healthcare Germany. Into February, \u201cwe simply grabbed every single instrument we could find,\u201d while hiring new lab staff and stockpiling crucial chemicals needed for testing.\nOf all countries, South Korea had best demonstrated the value of mass testing early in the pandemic, making use of commercially supplied kits. One, from South Korea\u2019s Seegene Inc, was not evaluated until mid-March by Public Health England. Based on that evaluation, NHS labs began purchasing and using it in early April. German labs had been using that test since mid-February.\nA spokesman for Public Health England said that, within the UK\u2019s overall strategy, the agency\u2019s role \u201cwas to provide an assured testing capability\u201d for the virus \u201cwhile commercial partners worked to develop their own capability.\u201d NHS labs were free to order and validate their own private test kits or develop their own, the agency said.\nThe heads of three NHS labs told Reuters otherwise: They said they had waited for Public Health England\u2019s evaluation before placing such orders.\nThe NHS didn\u2019t directly address a question from Reuters about the evaluation of tests by Public Health England. It said in a statement that overall policy on testing is set by the government, informed by advice from Public Health England. The statement added that \u201cas more reagent supplies became available, NHS-run laboratories were able to increase their capacity to test for COVID-19.\u201d\nThe bulk of tests for the coronavirus in the early stage of the outbreak was done within Public Health England\u2019s own labs. A clinical adviser to the government said the agency had been \u201cvery centralised\u201d and \u201cmade quite clear they are controlling all of the testing.\u201d\nAt the beginning, \u201cthe only game in town was the PHE test,\u201d agreed Allan Wilson, president of the Institute of Biomedical Science, which represents NHS laboratory staff.\nThe system wasn\u2019t designed for fast results.\nRavi Gupta, a Cambridge University professor of clinical microbiology, said patients at Cambridge\u2019s Addenbrooke\u2019s Hospital had likely infected others with the coronavirus while kept on wards waiting for test results. In the early weeks, he said, they had to wait two to four days. Gupta helped develop a 90-minute test.\nMembers of parliament\u2019s science committee criticised Public Health England in May for initially restricting testing to a small number of labs, calling it \u201cone of the most consequential\u201d decisions of the crisis. Selbie responded by stating the responsibility for testing policy lay with the government\u2019s health ministry, the Department of Health. \u201cPHE operates reference laboratories for novel and dangerous pathogens and would not be expected to operate mass testing programmes,\u201d he said.\nSILENT OUTBREAK\nIn Birmingham, the virus arrived unnoticed.\nZia Choudhry remembers his father, Mohamed Aslam Wassan, a 67-year-old retired businessman \u201cfull of love and full of energy\u201d coming home with a cough on March 15. Choudhry lived with his dad and his mother, together with his wife and children, in a house in Lozells, a district of Birmingham.\nIn the next few weeks, Wassan, remembered by some for bringing a famous snack, Bombay Mix, to the city, would die of COVID-19. So would four of his close friends, all well-known faces in the local Pakistani community. They were among at least 1,000 who would die across the city.\nUntil his father had taken ill, Choudhry recalled, there had been little sign that the epidemic had arrived. Up to that time, no death from COVID-19 had been recorded in this city of just over one million people. The city council had just issued a press release confirming a total of five local cases, and reminding citizens \u201cthe risk to the general public remains low.\u201d\nBut the infection had already been seeded. By Reuters calculations, based on later deaths, about 29,000 people were infected in Birmingham by that point.\nThere were grim days that followed. Eight days after his infection, Wassan was hospitalized. He was put on a ventilator the next day, and it was turned off after five more days. Choudhry could not attend his father\u2019s funeral.\nChoudhry believes the advice to socially isolate by staying at home, which did not come until March 23, should have come earlier. His father had been healthy enough to live much longer, he thinks. \u201cYou know, it was not his time,\u201d he said.\nSpeaking at a press conference in early June, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it was still too early to draw conclusions about early decisions. \u201cAll such judgments will need to be examined in the fullness of time,\u201d he said.\nIn interviews, seven directors of public health at large local authorities told Reuters they received little more information than the government released to the public on its website. The directors, who are employed by local authorities, not by Public Health England, said this lack of communication hampered their efforts to prevent the virus spreading.\n\u201cWe were flying blind,\u201d said Lisa McNally, director of public health in Sandwell, a district neighbouring Birmingham.\nMcNally said the government refused to share models used by its scientific advisers and the data that fed them. They wouldn\u2019t reveal, for example, how many people from her area were calling the NHS helpline with COVID-19 symptoms. If local officials had been kept informed there could have been special efforts to work out the source of infection, or an information campaign aimed at a particular area to reinforce the lockdown.\n\u201cWe basically would have done contact tracing,\u201d she said.\nLouise Smith, the director of health in the rural county of Norfolk, in eastern England, was angry that mortality and case data weren\u2019t shared by local hospitals. From March to mid-April, she said, \u201cI was finding out about the deaths by reading the local newspaper.\u201d\nIn Birmingham, the city\u2019s health director Justin Varney said when the first deaths occurred in early March, the national protocol was to get a personal call from Chris Whitty or his deputy. Varney\u2019s first call came from another official. He was given neither a name nor postcode of the victim. It was just the \u201cbarest minimum of details\u201d and he was told \u201cnot do anything with that until the NHS announced it.\u201d\nWhitty did not respond to a request for comment.\nAnd the information blackout continued. Throughout most of the outbreak, Birmingham\u2019s Varney, like other public health directors, was given no more detail about deaths and infections than was published on national websites, with the exception of information about outbreaks in nursing homes or other institutions. A breakdown of deaths by neighbourhood, which would have identified clusters like in Lozells, was not released until May 1.\nSecrecy was pervasive. Dr Helen Carter, Public Health England\u2019s deputy director in the Midlands, revealed in a May 15 memo to Birmingham councillors that the government had initially ordered the agency not to share with local councils its surveillance reports containing data about notified cases from local hospital emergency rooms and general practitioners.\n\u201cUntil April 2020 PHE was not permitted to share the surveillance reports with local partners by the Cabinet Office,\u201d she wrote in the memo, which is reported here for the first time. After April, information was shared with public health directors, but the reports remained official secrets and were \u201cmarked as official sensitive and not in the public domain,\u201d said the memo, which was reviewed by Reuters.\nPublic Health England declined requests by Reuters to interview Carter or any member of its staff involved in contact tracing. A spokesman said some of its surveillance reports were classified as \u201cofficial sensitive\u201d which, the spokesman said, was standard practice for non-public information. The agency had a \u201cconstant dialogue\u201d with local health directors, with \u201croutine exchanges of information and data,\u201d the spokesman added.\nThe government also restricted the power of local authorities to inform their communities about the spread of the virus. Health director Varney, who works for the city of Birmingham, said in the beginning there had been \u201ca complete embargo on local government doing proactive (communications) about COVID. At this stage, everything was being centrally controlled.\u201d\nA spokesman for the health ministry declined to respond to questions about its relationship with local health directors or its media strategy.\nIn Varney\u2019s view, communication was urgently needed to prevent misunderstandings about the virus taking hold and to target communities where many elderly people have poor English. He used a regulatory loophole to get the message out: He found he was allowed to talk about issues affecting \u201ccommunity cohesion.\u201d\nCALLING A HALT\nSophie Grenville and her husband, Mark, who manage a country estate in the county of Hampshire, took matters into their own hands.\nIt was early March when the couple tested positive for the coronavirus. She described her experiences later in a journal she shared with Reuters called \u201cA Diary of a Super Spreader.\u201d Her case illustrates the complexity and the slow pace of the early UK version of contact tracing.\nThe couple was tested for the virus after returning from a trip to Indonesia on Feb. 23. They developed what grew into a very distinctive, dry cough \u2013 like a fox or a deer barking \u2013 and reported it to the NHS helpline. They waited three days for a test. All the while, she wrote in the diary, she and her husband were thinking of the hundreds of people they recently had come into contact with at social and business events, from \u201cHigh Court judges to football chiefs.\u201d\nNurses in protective clothing visited their home on March 6 and took samples. The next day, they received the call with the positive test result, and later another call from an epidemiologist from Public Health England. Grenville said she was told the agency was only interested in people the couple had been in touch with when Grenville or her husband had recognizable symptoms.\nAt this point, Public Health England had been running a contact-tracing service for several weeks. When someone tested positive, they would get in touch and seek out potential contacts. In response to questions from Reuters, Public Health England said it couldn\u2019t comment on individual cases, but, \u201cWe followed the contact-tracing guidance that was in place at the time. This guidance stated that contacts should be traced from the point of notification of symptoms. This has changed as the knowledge of the virus has grown.\u201d Public Health England and the World Health Organization now recommend tracing contacts from two days before the onset of symptoms.\nSlideshow ( 20 images )\nEven by March, Public Health England\u2019s operation was under-resourced. Teams that usually dealt with food poisoning, measles or tuberculosis outbreaks had been drafted in.\nAccording to two senior doctors who were directly involved, the Public Health England teams were asked to cover huge regions. They didn\u2019t have the manpower to conduct serious contact tracing for measles, let alone COVID-19. Minutes of a February 18 meeting of the government\u2019s top scientific advisory committee, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), revealed that nationally Public Health England could then handle only five new cases per week. A spokesman for Public Health England told Reuters that reflected the complex international nature of early cases.\nSophie Grenville said that in her case contact tracers reached out to just two people \u2013 two sons the couple had taken out for dinner the night they had developed slight coughs. She and her husband decided to do their own contact tracing, alerting many other people they had recently encountered.\n\u201cWe were more upfront than we were advised we needed to be,\u201d Grenville said.\nShe recounted the chaotic scene in her diary: \u201cAll of Sunday we are making calls and discovering that all sorts of people we have seen have symptoms, some worse than others, and plenty we have seen are also completely fine. Everyone in our circle is having to tell their workplaces about their exposure and they are all shutting down.\u201d\nAbout 15 people the Grenvilles knew arranged to be tested, after reporting that they either had been in close contact with the couple or were exhibiting symptoms. Their farm manager tested positive, as well as a lady they had dropped in to see during the weekend, and two sons who had displayed no symptoms. Luckily, she said, none required hospitalization.\nMeanwhile, the actual source of the outbreak remained a mystery, including to Public Health England, Sophie Grenville recalled. She and her husband originally had been able to get tested because on their return from Indonesia they had changed planes in Malaysia, which was considered an early hot spot. But their symptoms hadn\u2019t developed for more than a week. That raised the possibility that they hadn\u2019t caught coronavirus in Southeast Asia, but in Britain. Scientists believe it takes up to 14 days to develop COVID-19 symptoms, but the average is four to five days.\nIndeed, on March 5, the government was told by SAGE that transmission in the community was underway. Five days later, the committee heard the UK \u201clikely has thousands of cases \u2013 as many as 5,000 to 10,000 \u2013 which are geographically spread nationally.\u201d That confirmed what many experts had suspected. Jason Strelitz, the director of public health in the east London borough of Newham, said from the end of February he began telling colleagues \u201ctime and time again\u201d to be under no illusion: official figures for COVID-19 were \u201ca massive underestimate.\u201d\nBased on analysis of the wave of deaths in the weeks that followed, and applying standard methods developed by research epidemiologists, Reuters calculates that Britain only detected about 3% of all COVID-19 infections so far, including those with no symptoms. This method may underestimate the rate of detection, however, when the epidemic spread into nursing homes and fatality rates were likely higher than average. Research by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine estimated the UK detected 18% of COVID-19 cases with clinical symptoms, compared to 43% in Germany.\nBut instead of ramping up testing and contact tracing across the country, the government brought the programme to a halt. On March 12, chief medical adviser Whitty announced from now on, \u201call of the testing capacity\u201d would be pivoted to testing people in hospital with symptoms. Anyone else who fell sick with suspected COVID-19 would have to cope \u2013 and advised not even to contact the health service unless their condition grew serious. And contact tracing was over in all but special cases, such as outbreaks in prisons or immigration centres.\nFor some who had spent their lives fighting disease, the decision to scale back contact tracing in the community came as a shock. Among them was David Heymann, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, one of the world\u2019s leading experts on infection control and a former chairman of Public Health England. He learned how to contact trace in 1976 when tracking the spread of smallpox in the slums of Kolkata, India.\nHe believes \u201cmodellers\u201d \u2014 who use data and assumptions to predict a disease\u2019s spread \u2014 carried too much weight in decisions. And they appeared to have conditioned policymakers, he felt, to believe the virus could not be stopped. \u201cI don\u2019t think any field epidemiologist would recommend to stop contact tracing in an outbreak.\u201d\nWhitty, the government\u2019s most senior medical adviser, didn\u2019t comment.\nPapers published by SAGE appear to support Heymann\u2019s suspicion that modelling scientists influenced the decision to stop routine contact tracing. SAGE\u2019s modelling committee said as early as February 3 that contact tracing \u201cis not practical once there are large numbers of cases.\u201d\nA further detailed study by three modellers from the University of Cambridge , Manchester University and Public Health England, submitted to SAGE on Feb. 12, argued that beyond a certain point in the outbreak, testing would be pointless. SAGE endorsed this paper on Feb. 18, according to published minutes, concluding that contact tracing would \u201cno longer be useful\u201d in the case of \u201csustained transmission\u201d of the virus.\nSome countries took a different approach. Just as Britain was shutting down its community tracing, Germany recruited an army of locally based contact tracers. In the southern city of Heidelberg and surrounding district of 800,000 people, local health director Rainer Schwertz told Reuters how by the second week of March, he had tripled the size of his department, recruiting 200 medical students to work on intensive tracing. By early June, just 38 people had died from COVID-19.\nA Public Health England spokesman said that contact tracing \u201cwas never abandoned.\u201d But once there was clear evidence of widespread, sustained community transmission of COVID-19, it was clear that contact tracing \u201cwas unlikely to control the outbreak alone and so was targeted where it could be most effective during this phase.\u201d The agency did not respond to a request for data showing what tracing continued.\nPublic health directors, nursing home managers and NHS staff interviewed by Reuters said they were not aware of any further tracing by Public Health England until the programme was relaunched in June.\nGOING IT ALONE\nTom Lewis, a consultant microbiologist at the Barnstaple hospital in north Devon, had spare capacity in his laboratory. He and his hospital team had tried in early April to offer testing for nursing home residents in the local community \u201cbecause nobody else was doing anything.\u201d But senior NHS executives ordered his team \u201cto back off. They said, this is not your job. This is a PHE job. So we said, \u2018fine.\u2019\u201d\nThe NHS didn\u2019t comment about the incident.\nLocal teams from Public Health England had done stellar tracing work in the early days of the outbreak, said Lewis. But then the \u201ccontract tracing stopped without really any warning and PHE then went very distant. I\u2019ve had almost no contact with PHE since then.\u201d\nHe said the agency was \u201cmassively over-stretched\u201d and it was unclear who was in charge.\nThis dysfunction was felt by some on the frontline. Roxanne Jenner-Ash, the manager of a Barnstaple nursing home, described a feeling of isolation at the height of the outbreak. \u201cThere was a point when no one wanted to support us,\u201d she said. Everyone \u2013 general practitioners, nurses and paramedics \u2013 all had different guidance and \u201ceveryone had different roles and opinions.\u201d At the same time, their residents were suffering: \u201cYou\u2019ve got people who can\u2019t feel heat, they can\u2019t make sense of what\u2019s going on, they can\u2019t communicate that they\u2019re in pain.\u201d\nAfter dealing with an outbreak in which nine residents died, Jenner-Ash was only sent swab kits to test her residents on May 9, when the infection had stopped spreading at the nursing home, at least for the time being.\nBut for Lewis the key thing was the absence of contact tracing \u2013 a real attempt to follow the spread of the virus, for example by interviewing and testing care workers who had been in contact with a COVID-positive patient, even if they had no symptoms.\nStarting in early May, Lewis and his NHS colleagues decided to launch their own wider tracing scheme. They followed contacts who tested positive at the Barnstaple hospital with the help of a sexual health adviser employed by the trust, Joanne Hamilton. Hamilton\u2019s work on sexually transmitted diseases had made her an experienced contact tracer.\nWhen another resident of her Pilton House nursing home tested positive in late May, this time, said Jenner-Ash, \u201cI was no longer alone.\u201d Within a day of the test result, Lewis and Hamilton had arranged for the entire staff of Pilton House to be tested \u2013 an exercise that uncovered a staff member who was positive and could then isolate, possibly saving the lives of others. Since then, Pilton House has remained COVID free.\nReuters learned there were small, similar experiments repeated across the country, in the highlands of Scotland, in the Lake District, in Wales, and in Sheffield, in northern England.\nBing Jones, a retired doctor who specialised in haematology, was one of a group of six retired medics who set up the Sheffield project. He said the national decision to stop contact tracing was a \u201ccatastrophic decision\u201d that has allowed the virus to travel largely unchecked across the United Kingdom and resulted in unnecessary deaths.\n\u201cIt is complete ineptitude. It was such a basic mistake. It is one of the basic planks of managing an epidemic,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was no reason why you couldn\u2019t have kept it going on a small scale or doing whatever you could.\u201d\nWorking with local general practitioners from mid-April, the group found 13 people with coronavirus symptoms, who generated 58 contacts.\nThey concluded that health and care workers may have been unwittingly passing on the virus. Judy Stewart, one of the volunteers on the Sheffield programme, said she contacted five nurses, including some who worked at a nearby hospital, to advise them to self-isolate after they were named as being in close contact with someone who had recently tested positive for COVID-19. Stewart said the nurses told her they discussed the request with their managers, but they were advised to ignore the request and keep working.\n\u201cThe resistance shocked me because of where it came from,\u201d she said. \u201cI got lots of texts back saying: \u2018sorry I can\u2019t be involved, but good luck and it was nice talking to you.\u2019\u201d\nBehind that resistance, some involved feared, was a concern among senior health service managers that too much testing and too much tracing of the contacts of healthcare workers would have \u2013 at a time of acute crisis \u2013 resulted in too many key staff taking time off work to isolate for at least the seven days mandated by the government.\nChris Morley, the chief nurse overseeing Sheffield\u2019s main hospitals, responded that the volunteer scheme was \u201cnot part of the Public Health England official Test and Trace System and our staff would therefore not necessarily have been aware of what it was or the legitimacy of the person asking them to self-isolate.\u201d\nIn London, the Francis Crick Institute, which runs a lab that has provided COVID-19 tests for hospitals, offered on April 15 to launch a programme to search for health workers who might be infected, even while showing no symptoms. University College London Hospitals conducted a month-long study of 200 healthcare workers from the end of March; 42 tested positive with the virus, but only eight had symptoms that met the official case definition. By the time of its offer, Crick had spare capacity to run at least 1,000 more tests a day.\nBut despite Crick\u2019s intensive lobbying to government ministers, NHS leaders and Selbie, the Public Health England chief, the testing programme was blocked, two sources with direct knowledge told Reuters.\nPublic Health England and the NHS referred questions about Crick\u2019s offer to the health ministry, the Department of Health, which told Reuters: \u201cThere was no guidance or instruction to NHS trusts to limit their testing programmes to hospital admissions.\u201d Increased capacity meant testing could now be extended to asymptomatic staff, a spokesperson said.\nOver the past two months, Britain finally ramped up community testing for the coronavirus and launched in late May what the prime minister called a \u201cworld-beating\u201d contact-tracing system staffed by thousands. But the new British smartphone app - heralded as a lynchpin of the contract-tracing system that was supposed to roll out last month - has been delayed. The government conceded the NHS COVID-19 App may not be ready until autumn at the earliest.\nreporting by Stephen Grey, Andrew MacAskill, Ryan McNeill, Steve Stecklow and Tommy Wilkes; additional reporting by Thomas Escritt and Paul Carrel in Berlin and Elizabeth Piper in London; edited by Janet McBride\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"url": "/article/idUSKCN24K0QU", "headline": "Hamilton criticises F1 after 'rushed' anti-racism gesture", "published_date": "2020-07-19", "text": "By Alan Baldwin\n3 MIN READ\n(Reuters) - Six times world champion Lewis Hamilton criticised Formula One\u2019s leaders after what he called a \u201crushed\u201d anti-racism gesture by some drivers before the start of Sunday\u2019s Hungarian Grand Prix.\nFormula One F1 - Hungarian Grand Prix - Hungaroring, Budapest, Hungary - July 19, 2020 Race winner Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton during a press conference after the race FIA/Handout via REUTERS\nHamilton, who won from pole position to take the championship lead after three races, again took a knee while wearing a Black Lives Matter T-shirt, but some drivers were either too late or remained standing.\nOnly eight of the 15 who turned up on time joined the only Black driver in kneeling.\n\u201cMoving forwards we need to speak to Formula One,\u201d Hamilton told Sky Sports television. \u201cThey need to do a better job.

Lewis in January 2017 said he did not view Trump as a \u201clegitimate\u201d president because of Russian meddling in the 2016 election to boost his candidacy. Trump drew criticism even from fellow Republicans when he called Lewis \u201call talk\u201d and \u201cno action.\u201d\nLewis was present at many of the civil rights movement\u2019s seminal moments, and was the youngest speaker at the 1963 March on Washington where Martin Luther King delivered his \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech, hoping for a land where Blacks \u201cwill not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.\u201d\nLewis, the last surviving speaker at that speech, maintained the fight for civil rights until the end of his life. He made his last public appearance in June, as protests for racial justice swept the United States and the world.\nUsing a cane, he walked with Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser on a street by the White House that Bowser had just renamed Black Lives Matter Plaza, which had just been dedicated with a large yellow mural - large enough to be seen from space - reading \u201cBlack Lives Matter.\u201d\nAmid a national movement to abolish Confederate monuments and symbols, calls have grown rename the bridge in Selma, Alabama, where Lewis was brutally beaten during a 1965 voting rights march, for Lewis. It is named for Edmund Pettus, who fought in the Confederate Army and robbed African-Americans of their right to vote after Reconstruction.\nLong before the March on Washington, Lewis helped found the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), which became a prominent civil rights group, and served as its president for three years.\nHe proved he was willing to risk his life for the cause of civil rights and non-violent protest and organized the first lunch-counter sit-ins demanding service for Blacks at whites-only eateries.\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\nIn 1960, at a whites-only diner in Nashville, Tennessee, a white waitress dumped cleaning powder down his back and water on his food. He was beaten by whites in South Carolina and Alabama during 1961 anti-segregation bus tours called Freedom Rides. And he suffered further injuries during \u201cBloody Sunday\u201d in 1965 in Selma.\n\u201cI thought I was going to die a few times,\u201d he said in a 2004 interview, mentioning Selma and a 1961 mob beating at a bus station in Montgomery, Alabama. \u201cI thought I saw death, but nothing can make me question the philosophy of non-violence.\u201d\nBarack Obama, the first Black U.S. president, awarded Lewis the presidential medal of freedom, America\u2019s highest civilian honor, in 2011.\n\u201cGenerations from now, when parents teach their children what is meant by courage, the story of John Lewis will come to mind - an American who knew that change could not wait for some other person or some other time, whose life is a lesson in the fierce urgency of now,\u201d Obama said a White House ceremony.\nLewis was born on Feb. 21, 1940, in Troy, Alabama, when Blacks faced segregation in all public facilities and were effectively barred from voting in the U.S. South - where Black slavery ended only due to the 1861-1865 Civil War - thanks to the notorious \u201cJim Crow\u201d laws.\n\u2018I FELT SO FREE\u2019\nLewis plunged into the civil rights movement as a student at Fisk University in Nashville, where he organized the sit-ins at segregated lunch counters.\n\u201cThe Nashville sit-ins became the first mass arrest in the sit-in movement, and I was taken to jail,\u201d Lewis said.\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you, I felt so liberated. I felt so free. I felt like I had crossed over. I think I said to myself, \u2018What else can you do to me? You beat me. You harassed me. Now you have placed me under arrest. You put us in jail. What\u2019s left? You can kill us?\u2019\u201d\nThe \u201cBloody Sunday\u201d attack took place when segregationist Alabama Governor George Wallace directed police to use night sticks and tear gas to stop the peaceful march for voting rights led by Lewis and others.\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\nAs hundreds of Black protesters crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge, state troopers, many on horseback, waded into the crowd swinging billy clubs. Lewis was beaten so badly that his scars were visible decades later when he served in Congress.\nThe horrific nature of the event inspired action in Washington. President Lyndon Johnson days later demanded that Congress approve legislation removing barriers to Black voting. Lawmakers then passed the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965.\nIn a moving postscript to his protest years, Elwin Wilson, a white man who assaulted Lewis at a bus station in Rock Hill, South Carolina, in 1961, traveled to Washington in 2009 to apologize tearfully to Lewis, who forgave him.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what the movement was always about - to have the capacity to forgive and move toward reconciliation,\u201d Lewis told the New York Times in 2013 after Wilson died at age 76.\nAfter leaving SNCC in 1966, Lewis worked for community organizations. He later was Democratic President Jimmy Carter\u2019s choice to head the federal volunteer program ACTION and he was elected to the Atlanta City Council in 1981.\nLewis lost his first run for the House in 1977 to Democrat Wyche Fowler in the campaign to replace Andrew Young, the first Black elected to Congress from Georgia in modern times. Carter had picked Young to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.\nWhen Fowler headed to the Senate, Lewis defeated another civil rights figure, Julian Bond, in 1986 for the House seat representing the congressional district encompassing Atlanta.\nIn the House, he amassed a liberal voting record and was a member of the House Democratic leadership team.\nLewis began the 2008 campaign supporting Hillary Clinton as she faced Obama for the Democratic presidential nomination. After Obama won Georgia\u2019s Democratic primary, Lewis switched allegiance in a key moment of the campaign.\nAs a congressman in June 2016, Lewis used the non-violent protest tactics he learned from King to help organize a 24-hour sit-in on the House floor to push for gun control legislation following a shooting that killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. The rare protest virtually shut down the chamber.\nLewis had one son with his wife Lillian, who died in 2012.\nReporting and writing by Will Dunham; Additional reporting by Patricia Zengerle in Washington, Trevor Hunnicutt in New York; Editing by Bill Trott, Sonya Hepinstall and William Mallard\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"url": "/article/idUSL2N2EJ0CD", "headline": "In Arizona, school reopening sparks protest movement", "published_date": "2020-07-18", "text": "By Andrew Hay, Brendan O\u2019Brien\n5 MIN READ\nJuly 18 (Reuters) - Arizona third-grade teacher Stacy Brosius has been called a \u201cliberal socialist Nazi\u201d and a \u201cwhiner and complainer\u201d for leading car-based protests to delay in-person schooling, but she says she\u2019s doing it to save lives in a pandemic.\nInspired by Black Lives Matter demonstrations, hundreds of Arizona teachers like Brosius are putting on red t-shirts they last wore in a 2018 strike and driving around cities in cars daubed with slogans like: \u201cRemote learning won\u2019t kill us but COVID can!\u201d\nWith \u201cmotor marches\u201d spreading to other coronavirus-hit sunbelt states, including Florida, and counter demonstrators organizing \u201creopen\u201d rallies, the fight over the new school year is fast becoming America\u2019s new protest flashpoint.\nIn Arizona, teachers want Republican Governor Doug Ducey to push the start of in-person school to at least early October after a beloved educator died of COVID-19 teaching summer school and statewide hospitalizations and deaths spiral.\nAt stake, Arizona teachers say, is the safety of the state\u2019s 1.1 million public school students and 20,000 teachers.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want any children to get this from us, because as a teacher, I don\u2019t want to go to any of their funerals,\u201d said Brosius, 47, who is not prepared to send her three children back to school.\nSchool re-openings have become a white-hot election issue after President Donald Trump demanded a return to in-person learning throughout the United States, while Democrats urge remote schooling until COVID-19 case rates flatten.\nArizona has been hit hard by the virus this summer as its 7-day average of new cases has gone from 500 at the end of May to more than 3,000 in July, while hospitals\u2019 intensive care capacity, according to most recent data from Arizona Department of Public Health, stood at a nearly 90 percent this week.\nDucey on Thursday said he would not be swayed by politics, adding he would be comfortable sending his children back to school, as did the state\u2019s health chief, Cara Christ.\nWith slogans like \u201cfreedom over fear,\u201d Arizona parents are demanding their children have the option of in-person learning. A \u201cREOPEN our SCHOOLS\u201d protest is set for July 30 in Phoenix in support of Ducey\u2019s mandate that in-person classes resume Aug. 17, after the Deer Valley Unified School District delayed their start until Oct. 14.\n\u201cAll we want is our choices back,\u201d said protest organizer Christina DeRouchey, the mother of four school-age children.\n\u2018RED FOR ED\u2019\nTeachers wearing \u201cRed for Ed\u201d t-shirts - the same garb they wore during a successful week-long pay strike two years ago -- are planning a much larger motor march July 22 to circle the state capitol and governor\u2019s office.\nThe red shirts are a symbol of nationwide strikes by educators over the past few years that some believe may be rekindled this fall.\nArizona teachers are not alone in their protests. Teacher unions across the nation, especially those recently entangled in labor battles, are organizing to become active participants in when and how to re-open schools.\nThe United Teachers Los Angeles have won an indefinite delay to in-person learning. Others in more conservative states such as Florida are trying to push back classroom start dates and boost funding for personal protective equipment.\n\u201cThis is a core piece of what our educators come together for, which is to demand that schools are properly funded,\u201d said Joe Thomas, president of the Arizona Education Association (AEA) \u201cUntil we can see that, we are not ready to come back to schools.\u201d\nMuch like they did in 2018, Arizona educators are using social media hashtags and online petitions to demand schools not have funding reduced if students switch to remote learning.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to compare it to our walkout in 2018,\u201d said Kelley Fisher, a kindergarten teacher who helped organize the walkout campaign in 2018. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair to put any child or any teacher or any family\u2019s life at stake because they have to open a school building.\u201d\nDucey, who has the authority to open or close schools, moved the start of school back until Aug. 17, a delay of one or two weeks for most districts in response to the rise in coronavirus cases. Some have decided to begin the school year with remote learning while others will implement online and in-person instruction.\nDucey said on Thursday he will finalize his decision on the re-opening of schools next week after he speaks with educators around the state.\n\u201cOur kids are going to be learning in the fall. We are going to do our best to conduct the most positive educational year that we can,\u201d Ducey said.

In \u201cThe Long Good Buy,\u201d Peter Oppenheimer, Goldman Sachs\u2019 chief global equity strategist, gives investors tools to identify the types of financial cycles Fisher failed to identify. Though written before the Covid-19 crisis, the book can help make sense of the magical thinking driving today\u2019s head-scratching market and the gyrations in asset totals at giant fund manager BlackRock, which reported its second-quarter earnings on Friday.\nA trader looks up at a chart on his computer screen while working on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange shortly after the market opening in New York July 11, 2013. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson\nHistorical perspective is Oppenheimer\u2019s strong suit. While his book mostly focuses on the last 50 years, he also reaches further back. He not only covers the U.S. railway frenzy of the 1870s, but also Great Britain\u2019s eighteenth-century canal boom. He breaks down marquee market blowups \u2013 like the 1929 crash and the 2007-2009 financial crisis \u2013 but also discusses events that younger investors might be less familiar with, like the United Kingdom\u2019s ignominious exit from the European exchange rate mechanism in 1992.\nThis all gives him credibility to make a more nuanced argument than is often laid out in investment books. Sure, markets are defined by cycles, he says, but these are a complex web of economics, human emotions and policy \u2013 not a financial version of a sine wave. He describes multiple types of bull and bear markets, including cyclical, event-driven, structural and even non-trending.\nTo make matters even more complicated, Oppenheimer argues that technological, regulatory and other changes \u2013 like the internet, low interest rates and globalization \u2013 can affect the shape and duration of cycles. This is why identifying inflection points isn\u2019t as simple as, say, pointing to an inverted yield curve and hitting \u201csell.\u201d Especially because mini cycles occur even as longer trends persist.\nSo how does this help make sense of this year\u2019s Covid-19 market swings? At first glance, the S&P 500 Index\u2019s almost 35% plunge to a late-March low seems like an event-driven bear market. Unlike cyclical bear markets, which are normally the result of declining profit expectations, rising inflation and interest-rate and recession fears, event-driven plunges are typically caused by exogenous shocks, emerge amid low inflation and are short-lived.\nThough the recent steep dip seems unbelievably brief, the facts broadly fit. Take BlackRock. Larry Fink\u2019s juggernaut just posted a solid second quarter. Its earnings increased 21% from the same period last year. That\u2019s a big improvement over last quarter\u2019s 23% drop. More importantly, the company\u2019s total assets under management rose back above $7 trillion after tumbling 13% to $6.5 trillion during the first quarter. Fund inflows helped, but so did Federal Reserve liquidity injections, which boosted valuations across the board.\nYet a closer look suggests that what may be happening \u2013 with the recent market rebound \u2013 is the continuation of a longer cycle. Oppenheimer points out that after 2009 the U.S. economy grew at a weaker pace compared to other post-1950 recoveries, yet the equity market performed well above average. It eclipsed its previous peak within four years. In comparison, after the crises that began in the U.S. in 1929 and Japan in the 1990s, equity prices were languishing under 50% of their peak even a decade later.\nSo the severe disconnect investors are currently experiencing between the real and financial economies is not a new phenomenon. It actually may be fairly predictable. After all, many of the forces driving equity prices in the past decade \u2013 such as ultra-low rates, aggressive central bank bond buying and the outperformance of technology stocks \u2013 have only accelerated in the most recent crisis.\nShould this be worrying for those investing with BlackRock or anyone else? Probably, yes. Oppenheimer wasn\u2019t ringing alarm bells before the crisis, but what he does say is that valuations matter, despite structural changes. Economic history shows that investors get in trouble when they convince themselves that absurd valuations are justified \u2013 whether for tulips, railroad stocks, Pets.com equity, subprime loans, or maybe electric-car makers and purveyors of videoconferencing software.\nOne conclusion might be that even if the extraordinary central bank response to the pandemic\u2019s economic fallout was necessary, it may also be making a long-term problem worse. That is, unless investors believe markets have now reached Fisher\u2019s plateau.\nBREAKINGVIEWS\nReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

And he almost had, when he was gunned down by a white man in 1966.\nThis year, life has become dangerous again.\u202f The other day Judy overheard Jay refuse a coronavirus test when his doctor called with concerns. Jay\u2019s picture had appeared in the newspaper. He\u2019d been at the park, talking to a group of suburban white kids wearing Black Lives Matter shirts.

Coronavirus cases have surged in the state since last month, when most Mississippi businesses were allowed to reopen. The majority of Mississippians infected, and killed, have been Black.\nThe virus demands caution, but Judy and Jay haven\u2019t just stayed locked in. America is experiencing a moment of reckoning on race, and they want to bear witness to the changes it brings.\nOne day last month, on Juneteenth, they ventured out to the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum. It was still closed because of the pandemic, but the Merediths are always welcome.\nSome things are familiar about this summer. The grandkids stop by in the daytime, cautiously, and the couple share home-cooked dinners while their dog, Charlie, steals scraps off Jay\u2019s plate. Outside, the magnolia trees have bloomed and the asphalt roads have softened under the heat.\nBut so much else has changed. During the height of a pandemic, people of all skin colors have taken to the streets of Jackson, and cities everywhere, to demand reforms after George Floyd\u2019s killing by a white police officer in Minneapolis. Mississippi has taken down its 126-year-old flag, the last state banner to feature the Confederate battle emblem. On Tuesday, the University of Mississippi, Ole Miss, removed a Confederate monument from the center of campus and put it in a Civil War graveyard.\nNot for the first time, the Merediths see their lives, and those of their family, intersecting with momentous, history-shaping events.\nIn 1965, the Voting Rights Act gave Blacks the vote, but they faced white intimidation against registering. So the next year, Jay undertook a 220-mile solitary \u201cwalk against fear,\u201d starting over the Tennessee state line in Memphis.\nAfter walking by Elvis Presley\u2019s Graceland mansion and entering Mississippi, he saw a white man waiting with a shotgun off Highway 51. The man, a hardware store clerk, called out his name, and then shot him three times. National radio broke into programming to announce that he was dead. But he was still breathing.\nMississippi had a long history of racial violence against Blacks, but this ambush was different: It had all been caught on camera. The image of Jay writhing on the ground transfixed America, much like the video of George Floyd this year.\nJudy calls her husband Jay. Others in their family call him J-Boy or Uncle J-Boy. But he\u2019s better known, in Mississippi and in history books, as James Meredith.\nTHE LAST BATTLE OF THE CIVIL WAR\nThe shooting wasn\u2019t Jay\u2019s first time in the line of fire.\nIn December 1962, Bob Dylan recorded the song \u201cOxford Town\u201d about him. At the time, Dylan was still an up-and-coming musician and Meredith was one of the most hated and admired men in America.\nHe went down to Oxford Town\nGuns and clubs followed him down\nAll because his face was brown\nBetter get away from Oxford Town\nThat year, Meredith had orchestrated one of the biggest victories of the American civil rights era when he became the first Black to attend Ole Miss in Oxford.\nThe school had been an all-white bastion of the Old South. The segregationist governor, Democrat Ross Barnett, had arrived on the scene to block Meredith\u2019s entry himself. White mobs in Oxford wanted him dead. But Meredith, an Air Force veteran, compelled the federal government to send more than 30,000 U.S. troops to uphold his right as a citizen to attend.\nHe had created one of the tensest moments of John F. Kennedy\u2019s presidency. Some historians have likened it to the last battle of the Civil War.\nGrowing up in Gary, Indiana, Judy watched these events on TV. \u201cLet\u2019s see if James Meredith survived another day,\u201d she remembers her father saying when he turned on the nightly news.\nJudy remembers her church preacher asking congregants to pray for Meredith, and she had. She also remembers her mother and aunt talking about him. \u201cThat James Meredith is one good-looking man,\u201d they used to say.\n\u201cI thought that was the best reality TV ever made,\u201d Judy says. It was one of the reasons she embarked on a career in broadcast journalism.\nWhat Jay did at Ole Miss has opened the doors for Judy, too.\nIn their living room, Dr. Judy Meredith takes down her PhD degree from Mississippi State University to demonstrate. She\u2019s been a TV news reporter and anchor, a Fulbright scholar, a music teacher, a university professor.\nToday, Judy and Jay live in Jackson\u2019s Fondren neighborhood, a leafy, mostly white upper-middle-class area. Still, huge racial disparities remain in the state.\nThese are evident, Judy says, in the surge of coronavirus cases among Blacks here, a sign of enduring economic and health deficits. Blacks make up 38% of the state\u2019s population, but they\u2019ve accounted for 54% of positive tests and half of all deaths among cases in which race has been reported. Things have grown dire this week, with many of the state\u2019s intensive-care units already reaching capacity and Republican Gov. Tate Reeves entreating Mississippians to mask up.\nThe divides are also on display at public schools. Many in Jackson are nearly all Black, and others in the suburbs nearly all white. Even at Ole Miss, Blacks still make up only 13% of the student body.\nIn other ways, Judy says, it\u2019s more subtle.\nAs an older Black woman in the Deep South, she\u2019s noticed something at the supermarket and in department stores: White women coming down the aisles expect her to move out of their way, she says.\nShe\u2019s mentioned this to friends, white ladies she lunches with. Sometimes she is met with blank stares.\n\u201cThey do it without even noticing,\u201d Judy says.\nIn recent years, Judy has begun playing a polite Southern game of chicken with white ladies at the stores. She\u2019s all smiles, but she stands her ground and waits for them to move out of her way.\nRecently, during long hours at home, Judy has been moved to tears when the couple watch George Floyd\u2019s killing. The footage has been inescapable.\nSlideshow ( 4 images )\n\u201cIt is terrible, disgusting,\u201d Judy says. But she has trouble understanding why it has prompted such an outpouring. Why now? There have been many other videos depicting police brutality against Blacks. None of them sent millions of protesters into the streets or brought down the Mississippi flag.\nJay says he knows why. The fuse was lit, this time, not just by Floyd\u2019s death, but by lockdowns, soaring unemployment, hunger, pent-up anger.\n\u201cThe pandemic,\u201d he says, \u201cset up America for an explosion.\u201d\nA FUNERAL AND A WEDDING\nAt the Civil Rights Museum, Judy does most of the talking. Even though the place is shut to visitors, a sound system is pumping loud spiritual music, and Jay\u2019s hearing is going. \u201cI\u2019m happy to be a sideshow,\u201d he says.\nHe\u2019s also wary. Few reporters have ever understood him, he says, admitting that he likes to confound people. One exception, he says, was the late Bill Minor, often considered the dean of Mississippi journalism. (The observation people remember by Minor \u2013 the one uttered through the Southern grapevine ever since \u2013 is this one: \u201cJames Meredith is crazy.\u201d It\u2019s something Jay doesn\u2019t exactly deny, either. Back at Ole Miss, he\u2019d trained himself never to blink when whites threw firecrackers at his feet.)\nBut at their home the next day, they both wax on during an interview that lasts four hours \u2013 at a safe social distance.\nThey describe how they met, in 1981. Jay was on his way to a funeral in Indiana.\nTwo years earlier, his first wife, Mary June, had died of a heart attack at age 41, leaving Jay with three boys to raise. Judy was a single mother too, with a son from an earlier marriage.\nIf she was starstruck by the man she\u2019d watched on TV two decades earlier, she didn\u2019t show it that day. \u201cI didn\u2019t want him getting any ideas,\u201d she says.\nHe got ideas anyway. Later, at the funeral in Indiana, he peered at the casket and then turned to their mutual friend: \u201cAin\u2019t nothing I can do for this man, so take me back to that woman.\u201d\nFor the next several weeks, Judy and Jay courted over long-distance calls that lasted until dawn. They exchanged family histories, and bonded over their childhoods, so similar even though they came from North and South, city and country. They debated current events.\nJudy was sharp, not shy about challenging Jay. She reminded him of his mother, Miss Roxie, a proud \u201cbelle of the county\u201d who took no sass from Jay, his nine siblings, or anyone else.\n\u201cI ain\u2019t never told nobody this,\u201d Jay says. \u201cBut I have one of the biggest egos in the world.\u201d\nAt that, Judy says, \u201cMmmm-hmmm.\u201d\nThey married 10 weeks after they met. Early in their life together, there were times when she bristled at his stubbornness. She left once, back to Gary. Jay went north and won her back.\n\u201cNow every time I leave home, I check to make sure she\u2019s still here,\u201d he says.\nLast year, Judy finished a short documentary about her husband called \u201cWho Is James Meredith?\u201d Before the pandemic hit, it was having a good run at film festivals.\nGiven their age difference, she seems aware that she will likely be a torchbearer for his legacy.\nIt\u2019s a complicated one.\nAt many turns, Jay has inflamed civil rights groups and would-be supporters. He\u2019s never wanted to be part of a movement, often preferring individual action or lone \u201cwalks\u201d to collective marches.\nSome of his actions have been unorthodox, to say the least.\nLike the time in the 1990s he supported David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan leader, for governor of Louisiana. Or when, earlier, he\u2019d endorsed the reelection of Mississippi Gov. Barnett, the man who\u2019d tried to block his way at Ole Miss.\nHe says everything he\u2019s done in life has followed a plan \u2013 a \u201cdivine mission\u201d \u2013 to dismantle white supremacy, including by showing no fear to its figureheads. In politics, he wants Blacks to know what they\u2019re up against.\n\u201cI prefer bigotry to be out in the open where I can confront it,\u201d he wrote to his unborn grandkids.\nHe has also courted controversy with speeches that veer into performance art.\nOne time, in a talk at his alma mater Ole Miss, he played the song \u201cShake Your Money Maker\u201d by Mississippi bluesman Elmore James, breaking into dance moves and telling students it was the most important thing they could learn about the Black experience in America.\nEverybody knows what the song is about, Jay says, but nobody wants to say it.\n\u201cI ain\u2019t gonna say it,\u201d Judy says.\n\u201cIt means you gotta shake your booty,\u201d Jay says, bursting into a laugh that detaches his dentures from his gums.\nA FAMILY AFFAIR\nFor all Jay\u2019s \u201clone wolf\u201d agitation and egotism over the years, what\u2019s most important to him is family.\nBoth he and Judy grew up in families that went to extremes to shield them, as children, from the ugliness of racism.\nJudy, born to a Black father and white mother, had been given up at birth. She was adopted at age 3 by parents from East Texas who had migrated north, like millions of other Blacks.\nShe grew up within earshot of the childhood home of Michael Jackson. The sound of the Jackson 5\u2019s daily band practices filled the street.\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t not hear them,\u201d she says.\nHer own gift for music was evident before kindergarten, and she spent her childhood almost always near a piano, at home, church and school. It was a sheltered existence, and Judy says her parents \u201cnever talked about race relations.\u201d\nShe remembers one moment when reality intruded, while riding with her mother on a trip down to East Texas.\n\u201cThis little white boy, riding a bike, called my mom n---er,\u201d she says. \u201cShe hollered out the window, \u2018Peckerwood,\u2019 but we didn\u2019t talk about it; she didn\u2019t stop to tell me what was going on.\u201d\nJay was raised on an 84-acre farm in Kosciusko, Mississippi (perhaps best known these days as the hometown of Oprah Winfrey). His father, Cap, instructed Jay that nothing could hold him back and he would be called upon to lead. As the Black owner of a sizable farm, Cap was well off for his time. He built fences several feet inside the property line so they could be maintained without bickering with white neighbors, with whom Jay had scarce contact.\nJay remembers the exact moment, at age 15, when he discovered that Southern whites viewed him as inferior.\nIt was on a 1948 train ride back from a family road trip to Chicago. When the train reached Memphis, the conductor ordered him and his brother to leave their seats, for which they\u2019d paid full fare, and go stand in the \u201ccolored car.\u201d\nJay says he cried all the way back to Mississippi.\n\u201cI cried, but I also started scheming.\u201d\nScheming, he says, to accept no Mississippi in which he or his kind could be degraded, just as his father, Cap, had done with his farm.\nHe talks at length about earlier generations, what they endured, inherited and passed down.\n\u201cMost of my life happened before I was born,\u201d Jay says.\nJudy and Jay share a vision of family as a relay of sorts, over the arc of time, in which each generation can, and must, seize a new set of gains.\nTheir son Joseph personified this, graduating summa cum laude from Harvard and later winning the outstanding doctoral student award at Ole Miss. Twelve years ago, Joseph died of lupus at age 39.\nA NEW GENERATION AT \u201cNEW MISS\u201d\nIn one of his letters to his grandchildren, Jay wrote: \u201cLife in America is combat.\u201d\nOle Miss was a war zone when Meredith arrived in Oxford in 1962. Thousands of white men, many of them armed, faced off against outnumbered federal marshals, the night sky illuminated by explosions. Two people died, hundreds were injured, and Jay slept through it all in a dorm room.\nToday, Judy and Jay think of Mississippi not only as home but as \u201cthe center of the universe.\u201d\nThis might seem improbable. It\u2019s the poorest of the 50 U.S. states, with the lowest life expectancy. People in Jackson sometimes joke that its streets have potholes big enough to catch catfish from.\nBut when change comes to Mississippi, the couple say, it has a tendency to reverberate elsewhere.\n\u201cNobody wants to be behind Mississippi,\u201d Jay says.\nIn a generation, Mississippi has gone from the epitome of segregation to a place where scores of Ole Miss students and alumni approach Jay for handshakes or autographs when the couple attend a football game there.\nNever mind, Judy says, that a few of the alumni might have yelled the N-word at Jay back in 1962.\nIn 2006, Judy and Jay attended the unveiling of a statue of him on campus. At first, he had mixed feelings about the statue. For one, he wasn\u2019t invited to the podium to speak at the ceremony. (The actor Morgan Freeman was among those enlisted to talk about him instead. Asked about the unveiling, an Ole Miss representative said, \u201cJames Meredith is one of our most notable alumni; however, we are not able to confirm those details from the event from 14 years ago.\u201d)\nIn 2014, the statue was defaced by white students who placed a noose around its neck along with a Confederate symbol. Afterward, a Black student guarded the statue for months, holding a daily vigil. It has become a popular gathering and protest spot for students, most recently in protective face masks.\n\u201cThe past is never dead. It\u2019s not even past,\u201d wrote another Ole Miss alumnus and a son of Oxford, the novelist William Faulkner. The writer died just a few months before Meredith\u2019s arrival on campus in 1962, but his nephew was in a National Guard unit deployed to protect Meredith. He was attacked by rioters throwing bricks and broke an arm.\nJudy and Jay have a granddaughter, Jylah Meredith Knight, who plans to start as a freshman at Ole Miss in the fall.\nIt isn\u2019t yet clear whether it will be safe for Jylah to attend classes on campus, but unlike her grandfather, she\u2019s in the same predicament as all students. It\u2019s a virus, this time, that has changed everything.\nReporting by Joshua Schneyer, editing by Kari Howard\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"url": "/article/idUSL5N2EO1OZ", "headline": "SPECIAL REPORT-Civil rights icon defied death.

REUTERS/Suzi Altman NO RESALES. NO ARCHIVES\nAt age 87, Jay is as stubborn as ever about his walks.\nSome days he leaves home in a crisply pressed suit, rolling behind him a hot-pink suitcase he got from a granddaughter who outgrew its color.\nHe uses it to carry his books for sale \u2013 many of them self-published and printed at the local Kinko\u2019s. People recognize him, though not as much as they used to.\nOne of Jay\u2019s books, written decades ago, is called \u201cLetters To My Unborn Grandchildren.\u201d Judy and Jay have 11 grandkids now, but he hadn\u2019t always counted on meeting them.\u202f The civil rights years were a dangerous time for Jay.\n\u201cAll I had to lose was my life,\u201d he wrote to them about that period. And he almost had, when he was gunned down by a white man in 1966.\nThis year, life has become dangerous again.\u202f The other day Judy overheard Jay refuse a coronavirus test when his doctor called with concerns. Jay\u2019s picture had appeared in the newspaper. He\u2019d been at the park, talking to a group of suburban white kids wearing Black Lives Matter shirts. His age and diabetes make him vulnerable to the virus.\n\u201cI\u2019ve just never known Jay to have any fear,\u201d Judy says.\nJay says he\u2019ll leave to God how many more walks he\u2019ll take, or how many more days he\u2019ll have with Judy, his wife of 39 years.\nShe\u2019s 16 years younger, but at 71, Judy is also at high risk. Coronavirus cases have surged in the state since last month, when most Mississippi businesses were allowed to reopen. The majority of Mississippians infected, and killed, have been Black.\nThe virus demands caution, but Judy and Jay haven\u2019t just stayed locked in. America is experiencing a moment of reckoning on race, and they want to bear witness to the changes it brings.\nOne day last month, on Juneteenth, they ventured out to the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum. It was still closed because of the pandemic, but the Merediths are always welcome.\nSome things are familiar about this summer. The grandkids stop by in the daytime, cautiously, and the couple share home-cooked dinners while their dog, Charlie, steals scraps off Jay\u2019s plate. Outside, the magnolia trees have bloomed and the asphalt roads have softened under the heat.\nBut so much else has changed. During the height of a pandemic, people of all skin colors have taken to the streets of Jackson, and cities everywhere, to demand reforms after George Floyd\u2019s killing by a white police officer in Minneapolis. Mississippi has taken down its 126-year-old flag, the last state banner to feature the Confederate battle emblem. On Tuesday, the University of Mississippi, Ole Miss, removed a Confederate monument from the center of campus and put it in a Civil War graveyard.\nNot for the first time, the Merediths see their lives, and those of their family, intersecting with momentous, history-shaping events.\nIn 1965, the Voting Rights Act gave Blacks the vote, but they faced white intimidation against registering. So the next year, Jay undertook a 220-mile solitary \u201cwalk against fear,\u201d starting over the Tennessee state line in Memphis.\nAfter walking by Elvis Presley\u2019s Graceland mansion and entering Mississippi, he saw a white man waiting with a shotgun off Highway 51. The man, a hardware store clerk, called out his name, and then shot him three times. National radio broke into programming to announce that he was dead. But he was still breathing.\nMississippi had a long history of racial violence against Blacks, but this ambush was different: It had all been caught on camera. The image of Jay writhing on the ground transfixed America, much like the video of George Floyd this year.\nJudy calls her husband Jay. Others in their family call him J-Boy or Uncle J-Boy. But he\u2019s better known, in Mississippi and in history books, as James Meredith.\nTHE LAST BATTLE OF THE CIVIL WAR\nThe shooting wasn\u2019t Jay\u2019s first time in the line of fire.\nIn December 1962, Bob Dylan recorded the song \u201cOxford Town\u201d about him. At the time, Dylan was still an up-and-coming musician and Meredith was one of the most hated and admired men in America.\nHe went down to Oxford Town\nGuns and clubs followed him down\nAll because his face was brown\nBetter get away from Oxford Town\nThat year, Meredith had orchestrated one of the biggest victories of the American civil rights era when he became the first Black to attend Ole Miss in Oxford.\nThe school had been an all-white bastion of the Old South. The segregationist governor, Democrat Ross Barnett, had arrived on the scene to block Meredith\u2019s entry himself. White mobs in Oxford wanted him dead. But Meredith, an Air Force veteran, compelled the federal government to send more than 30,000 U.S. troops to uphold his right as a citizen to attend.\nHe had created one of the tensest moments of John F. Kennedy\u2019s presidency. Some historians have likened it to the last battle of the Civil War.\nGrowing up in Gary, Indiana, Judy watched these events on TV. \u201cLet\u2019s see if James Meredith survived another day,\u201d she remembers her father saying when he turned on the nightly news.\nJudy remembers her church preacher asking congregants to pray for Meredith, and she had. She also remembers her mother and aunt talking about him. \u201cThat James Meredith is one good-looking man,\u201d they used to say.\n\u201cI thought that was the best reality TV ever made,\u201d Judy says. It was one of the reasons she embarked on a career in broadcast journalism.\nWhat Jay did at Ole Miss has opened the doors for Judy, too.\nIn their living room, Dr. Judy Meredith takes down her PhD degree from Mississippi State University to demonstrate. She\u2019s been a TV news reporter and anchor, a Fulbright scholar, a music teacher, a university professor.\nToday, Judy and Jay live in Jackson\u2019s Fondren neighborhood, a leafy, mostly white upper-middle-class area.

Asked about the unveiling, an Ole Miss representative said, \u201cJames Meredith is one of our most notable alumni; however, we are not able to confirm those details from the event from 14 years ago.\u201d)\nIn 2014, the statue was defaced by white students who placed a noose around its neck along with a Confederate symbol. Afterward, a Black student guarded the statue for months, holding a daily vigil. It has become a popular gathering and protest spot for students, most recently in protective face masks.\n\u201cThe past is never dead. It\u2019s not even past,\u201d wrote another Ole Miss alumnus and a son of Oxford, the novelist William Faulkner. The writer died just a few months before Meredith\u2019s arrival on campus in 1962, but his nephew was in a National Guard unit deployed to protect Meredith. He was attacked by rioters throwing bricks and broke an arm.\nJudy and Jay have a granddaughter, Jylah Meredith Knight, who plans to start as a freshman at Ole Miss in the fall.\nIt isn\u2019t yet clear whether it will be safe for Jylah to attend classes on campus, but unlike her grandfather, she\u2019s in the same predicament as all students.

That could mean better data now provides little guidance about the path ahead.\n\u201cThe ECB can hardly relax, its job is far from done,\u201d Berenberg economist Florian Hense said. \u201cDespite the ongoing recovery, the risks to the outlook remain tilted to the downside, including the risk of a major second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and harsh, nationwide lockdowns in major European economies.\u201d\nRising coronavirus case numbers around the globe are also likely to weigh on consumer and business confidence, holding back spending and investment and raising the chance that any recovery would be slow, uneven and prone to interruptions.\nMORE OF THE SAME\nThursday\u2019s ECB meeting is likely to hear some grumbling about the side-effects of the policy, including deviation from the ECB\u2019s so-called capital key, which requires the bank to buy bonds in proportion to the size of each euro zone economy.\nWhile the bank has said this remains a \u201cguiding\u201d principle, some worry that straying too far from this rule could open it to yet another legal challenge in Germany, just weeks after that country\u2019s top court attempted to curb its powers.\nPolicymakers are also likely to express annoyance that EU leaders are once again dragging their feet with a fiscal response, overburdening ECB policy, much as they have done over the past five years. They may also discuss the relaunch of a strategy review.\nEconomists nevertheless argue that more ECB action is just a matter of time.\nWhen called upon, the bank is still likely to increase bond purchases, provide a bigger exemption to banks from its punitive negative deposit rate and could buy more debt from various EU institutions that support the recovery.\nThe ECB delivers its decision at 1145 GMT, which will be followed by ECB President Christine Lagarde\u2019s press conference at 1230 GMT.

Of these, one was investigated as potential serious misconduct but was not proven.\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross said it dealt with 11 cases of alleged racism through its global compliance office since 2017, of which two were substantiated, with the rest dismissed, resolved, or have investigations still ongoing.\nIt added that although no formal complaints had been received from those who received aid \u201cwe should acknowledge that power imbalances between ICRC staff and the people we assist may exist and could serve as a barrier\u201d.\nThe United Nations Refugee Agency UNHCR said one staff member was \u201cseparated for a range of misconduct\u201d within the last five years, and two other disciplinary cases were ongoing.\nMercy Corps said it received three complaints alleging racism among staff in the past year, and a further three reports of tribal or ethnic-based discrimination.\nTHIRD REPORT ZERO CASES\nA third of organisations polled said they had no records of racism complaints made against staff in the past year.\nIslamic Relief Worldwide, Action Against Hunger France, ActionAid, Bangladesh-based BRAC, and Concern Worldwide all said they received no complaints last year, as did the U.N. children\u2019s fund UNICEF and humanitarian affairs office OCHA.\nRacism exists within the United Nations, Secretary General Antonio Guterres told staff last month, as he called for \u201can honest conversation\u201d and a greater focus on tackling the issue.\nThe Norwegian Refugee Council also said it had no reports of racism against staff via its global whistleblowing mechanism but could not exclude the possibility cases were dealt with locally.\nOxfam International and CARE International both said they did not hold data at a global level as cases were dealt with by member organisations individually.\nSave the Children International and World Vision International said they could not obtain figures as their global recording systems did not separate complaints of racism from other alleged discrimination or misconduct.\n\u201cWe are committed to tracking this information more effectively going forwards, whilst recognising that some cases ... may not always be identified or reported as such,\u201d said a spokeswoman for Save the Children International.\nWorld Vision International also said it was working on plans to better track racism complaints where local laws and legislation allow this.\n\u201cWe do not tolerate racism in our workplace. No context is immune to racism, and we are not complacent,\u201d said Andrew Morley, president of World Vision International.\nSeveral other agencies noted they did not track racism complaints as a specific category or that issues may have been dealt with at lower-levels.\n\u201cWhat we are seeing shows that everyone can do better,\u201d said Mohammed Ali, the programmes director at aid training and project support organisation Aid Works and a campaigner against racism in humanitarian operations.\nThe number of formally reported cases likely represented only the \u201ctip of the iceberg\u201d of racial discrimination, he said, adding, \u201clittle discriminations that happen all the time are not going to get captured by systems like this.\u201d\nDECLINE TO SHARE DATA\nAmong those which did not answer questions about the number of racism complaints or declined take part in the poll were Christian Aid, Food for the Hungry, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) and Plan International.\n\u201cWe take complaints of discrimination seriously and immediately investigate them,\u201d said an IRC spokeswoman, adding it did not share details of investigations but has taken disciplinary action for violations of its code of conduct.\n\u201cWe value diversity as a strength and are committed to becoming an anti-racist organisation,\u201d said Christian Aid chief executive Amanda Khozi Mukwashi in a statement, saying they have appointed external consultants to assess its systems.\nCompassion International said it considered workplace complaints to be internal matters and would not share details due to confidentiality concerns.\nTwo other organisations, Caritas Internationalis and International Medical Corps, made no response to the poll.\nAnti-racism activists urged aid groups to take action including improving monitoring, examining internal workplace cultures, and adapting reporting procedures to take account of local norms and cultures in different areas where they worked.\n\u201cWe need to get this right because it underpins every area we work in,\u201d said Lena Bheeroo, the lead on equity, diversity and inclusion work at UK international development network Bond and a committee member of the #CharitySoWhite campaign group.\nOrganisations failing to monitor racism cases effectively from the top \u201cmeans they are just perpetuating the problem\u201d.\n\u201cIf you are not addressing it at the highest levels, then you are being complicit,\u201d Bheeroo said.\nReporting by Sonia Elks @soniaelks; Editing by Belinda Goldsmith; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers the lives of people around the world who struggle to live freely or fairly.

REUTERS/Sarah Silbiger./File Photo\nThe court ended its nine-month term on Thursday by rejecting Trump\u2019s sweeping assertions of presidential immunity in a ruling that paves the way for a New York prosecutor to obtain the president\u2019s financial records, which he has sought to conceal. The court also rejected Trump\u2019s broad arguments for preventing Congress from obtaining similar records and sent the matter back to lower courts for further consideration.\nThose rulings were only the latest setbacks for the Republican president in the past month from a nine-member court that until this term generally backed him in big cases.\nThe court also ruled against Trump in blocking him from rescinding an immigration program created by his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama, in expanding LGBT rights and in striking down a restrictive Louisiana abortion law defended by his administration.\nRoberts was in the majority in all of those rulings. The chief justice, who served in the largely ceremonial role of presiding officer in Trump\u2019s Senate impeachment trial in February, is known for his concern about the court\u2019s reputation as an institution led by law and not politics.\n\u201cRoberts certainly has an interest in the court appearing independent and being independent,\u201d Chicago-Kent College of Law professor Carolyn Shapiro said.\nThat tendency was on display in the abortion ruling, Columbia Law School professor Gillian Metzger said.\nIn 2016, the court struck down a Texas law placing restrictions on doctors who perform abortions that was very similar to the Louisiana law. Roberts dissented in the ruling that invalidated the Texas law, but wrote the ruling that struck down Louisiana\u2019s, emphasizing the importance of respecting the court\u2019s precedents.\nOverturning the 2016 ruling would have harmed the court\u2019s reputation, Metzger said.\n\u201cHe has shown a real willingness to take the court\u2019s institutional integrity to heart this term,\u201d Metzger added.\nIt was noteworthy in Thursday\u2019s rulings on Trump\u2019s financial records that both of the justices he has appointed - Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch - voted against him.\n\u201cOnce a Supreme Court justice gets appointed, they have life tenure and can do what they want, rather than what the people who appointed them want them to do,\u201d said Harry Sandick, a former federal prosecutor in Manhattan.\nThe bad run for Trump began on June 15, when the court ruled 6-3 - with Gorsuch and Roberts joining the four liberal justices - that federal law protects gay and transgender workers from employment discrimination.\nThree days later, Roberts joined the liberals in a 5-4 ruling that thwarted Trump\u2019s plan to end a program that protects hundreds of thousands of immigrants who had lived in the United States illegally after entering as children - the so-called Dreamers.\nOn June 29, Roberts again joined the liberals in the 5-4 decision on Louisiana\u2019s abortion law.\nWith its 5-4 conservative majority, Trump allies had reason to expect smoother sailing at the court, which gave him some big victories earlier in his administration including upholding his travel ban targeting people from several Muslim-majority nations and allowing his ban on most transgender troops.\nThe recent losses have prompted both Trump and his supporters to grouse about the court.\n\u201cDo you get the impression the Supreme Court doesn\u2019t like me?\u201d Trump asked on Twitter after the Dreamers ruling.\n\u2018MORE CONSERVATIVE JUSTICES\u2019\nOn Thursday, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said the takeaway from the recent rulings was that \u201cwe need more conservative justices on the courts.\u201d\nIf Trump wins re-election on Nov. 3, he may get a chance to do just that, considering that two of the liberal justices are octogenarians: Ruth Bader Ginsburg (87) and Stephen Breyer (81).\nAs a candidate in 2016, Trump attracted conservative Christian voters by promising to appoint conservatives to the federal judiciary. Those voters, motivated by a desire to see the court\u2019s 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion overturned, remain a key part of his political base.\nRoberts and some of his colleagues may be keeping a close eye on the court\u2019s reputation during an election year.\nMany of the recent decisions forged by Roberts \u201chave, rather skillfully, taken the court out of center stage in the election,\u201d Shapiro said.\nTrump and his conservative allies certainly have not come up emptyhanded this term, with the court delivering important decisions favoring conservative policies, including a trio backing religious rights.\nThe court also handed a victory to conservatives critics of the federal bureaucracy in a ruling making it easier for the president to fire the head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an agency created under Obama.\nOf 60 rulings this term, only 12 ended up 5-4, illustrating that some justices seek consensus when possible.

REUTERS/David Gray\nThe blasts in late May became one facet of the Black Lives Matter protests in Australia, which saw thousands of people demanding an end to racial inequality in a country where Aboriginal groups have long suffered higher rates of imprisonment, unemployment and lower life expectancy.\nNow, however, the ground may be shifting.\nThe Western Australian government told Reuters it would push for indigenous groups, rather than a departmental committee, to be responsible for evaluating the importance of sacred sites.\nThe state\u2019s planning department said the legislation, which followed a two-year review of cultural heritage laws, would be introduced to the state parliament before the end of the year.\nThe bill is in the final stages of drafting and will be released soon for final consultation, it added.\nThe proposed legislation may fall short of demands of some indigenous groups since it is unlikely to give them a veto on development and could face opposition by lawmakers who see too much red tape, indigenous activists and a land rights lawyer said.\nBut the bill comes at a time when public outrage over the caves\u2019 destruction, fuelled by the Black Lives Matter movement, could yield different outcomes from a legal structure that has almost always greenlighted mining development at the expense of cultural sites.\nWestern Australia accounts for nearly all production of Australia\u2019s most valuable export - iron ore - which the government expects to be worth more than A$100 billion ($69.64 billion) this financial year.\nSince July 2010, miners have submitted more than 460 applications to disturb or destroy sites of potential cultural significance in the region, according to state parliament records, including Rio\u2019s Pilbara request. All but one of those applications were approved.\nNow there are signs of change - the sole request to be declined occurred last month.\nThe decision came after the Rio blasts at Juukan Gorge, which destroyed a site that showed 46,000 years of human occupation and focused attention on the heritage laws.\nRio acknowledged that it had blasted two caves as part of its expansion of the Brockman 4 iron ore mine and apologized for the distress it caused the traditional landowners, the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) people.\nIn addition to the detonated caves, Rio was cleared in 2013 by the state government to destroy four additional rock shelters at Juukan, according to government records, as part of its application to disturb the ancient gorge.\nArtefacts had previously been found at or near the sites, records show, and permission was granted before more extensive archaeological work could be conducted, with no ability to review that decision later.\nMapping data that Rio filed with the state\u2019s Department of Planning, Lands and Heritage and viewed by Reuters indicate two of the caves were within metres of the ones blasted in May. The other two are about 170 metres away.\nReuters could not independently verify whether the four additional sites have been damaged.

REUTERS/David Gray\nThe blasts in late May became one facet of the Black Lives Matter protests in Australia, which saw thousands of people demanding an end to racial inequality in a country where Aboriginal groups have long suffered higher rates of imprisonment, unemployment and lower life expectancy.\nNow, however, the ground may be shifting.\nThe Western Australian government told Reuters it would push for indigenous groups, rather than a departmental committee, to be responsible for evaluating the importance of sacred sites.\nThe state\u2019s planning department said the legislation, which followed a two-year review of cultural heritage laws, would be introduced to the state parliament before the end of the year.\nThe bill is in the final stages of drafting and will be released soon for final consultation, it added.\nThe proposed legislation may fall short of demands of some indigenous groups since it is unlikely to give them a veto on development and could face opposition by lawmakers who see too much red tape, indigenous activists and a land rights lawyer said.\nBut the bill comes at a time when public outrage over the caves\u2019 destruction, fuelled by the Black Lives Matter movement, could yield different outcomes from a legal structure that has almost always greenlighted mining development at the expense of cultural sites.\nWestern Australia accounts for nearly all production of Australia\u2019s most valuable export - iron ore - which the government expects to be worth more than A$100 billion ($69.64 billion) this financial year.\nSince July 2010, miners have submitted more than 460 applications to disturb or destroy sites of potential cultural significance in the region, according to state parliament records, including Rio\u2019s Pilbara request. All but one of those applications were approved.\nNow there are signs of change - the sole request to be declined occurred last month.\nThe decision came after the Rio blasts at Juukan Gorge, which destroyed a site that showed 46,000 years of human occupation and focused attention on the heritage laws.\nRio acknowledged that it had blasted two caves as part of its expansion of the Brockman 4 iron ore mine and apologized for the distress it caused the traditional landowners, the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) people.\nIn addition to the detonated caves, Rio was cleared in 2013 by the state government to destroy four additional rock shelters at Juukan, according to government records, as part of its application to disturb the ancient gorge.\nArtefacts had previously been found at or near the sites, records show, and permission was granted before more extensive archaeological work could be conducted, with no ability to review that decision later.\nMapping data that Rio filed with the state\u2019s Department of Planning, Lands and Heritage and viewed by Reuters indicate two of the caves were within metres of the ones blasted in May. The other two are about 170 metres away.\nReuters could not independently verify whether the four additional sites have been damaged. Rio declined to comment on the four additional sites and referred to its May 31 statement saying it was reviewing all work in the area since the May 24 blast.\nPOWER IMBALANCE\nThe Rio case highlights the power imbalance in the world\u2019s biggest iron ore precinct between miners and indigenous Australians who have no legal veto over development projects on their ancestral land, said indigenous academic Marcia Langton.\nUnlike their title suggests, traditional owners don\u2019t own the land and are only sometimes considered stakeholders in its management.\n\u201cThe missing ingredient in all of these arrangements is the right of the traditional owners to consent or refuse requests to destroy their sites,\u201d she said.\nUnder state rules, miners can destroy heritage sites like the ones at Juukan Gorge - where archaeologists had previously salvaged part of a 4,000-year-old belt made of plaited hair that provided a direct genetic link to the present day PKKP - for mine development by applying for an exemption to its Aboriginal Heritage Act.\nAs part of the state exemption process, a review is made by a departmental committee, which considers the economic value of the project rather than acting solely on behalf of traditional owners who have no right of appeal in the process.\nThe inclusion of indigenous voices in the heritage legislation is potentially an improvement, if it includes relevant local groups, said land rights barrister Greg McIntyre, who said he has was yet to see the details.\nBut the new legislation won\u2019t affect existing agreements with miners where there is a clause that prohibits traditional owners from filing any formal objections with state or federal authorities.\n\u201cAfter the event, there is no remedy for Aboriginal people if the site is damaged,\u201d said McIntyre, who led a historic case in the 1980s and 90s that recognised land rights of traditional owners had existed since before British settlement.\nThe Chamber of Minerals and Energy of Western Australia (CME) said it supported a review of current legislation.\n\u201cCME and its members remain committed to working with Government towards reforms to the Aboriginal Heritage Act that will provide positive, mutually-beneficial outcomes for both industry and Indigenous Australians,\u201d it said in a statement.\nRio declined to comment on clauses in its contracts but referred Reuters to an earlier statement.\n\u201cAs a company with strong ties and a long history of partnership with Indigenous Australians we are committed to updating our practices and working together so that we can co-exist for mutual benefit.\u201d\nDEMOLITION OF SITES\nThe decision to go ahead with the blast has confounded industry watchers given Rio had developed a strong reputation in the industry for its work with indigenous communities.\nHigh standards that Rio had set in the past have been eroded by departures of senior archaeologists as social responsibility reporting has become a largely tick-the-box exercise that can be done from an office, said Glynn Cochrane, an anthropologist and former senior advisor for Rio Tinto for nearly two decades.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve lost their base.

The former refers to people who willingly pay to cross borders illegally whereas the latter involves individuals being exploited through force or deception.\nAn INM official said there had been an \u201cimprecision\u201d with the January data and confirmed that the 601 migrants had not all been trafficked or smuggled. INM is the agency responsible for regulating migration, including visas and deportations.\nThe erroneous numbers come at a time when advocates say the government has little to show for its fight against trafficking.

Weeks earlier, they abandoned the building following clashes with protesters in the wake of the May 25 killing in Minneapolis of George Floyd, a Black man, at the hands of that city\u2019s police.\nFloyd\u2019s death triggered a nationwide wave of largely peaceful demonstrations against racial injustice and police brutality, giving rise in Seattle to the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest (CHOP) zone east of downtown.\n\u201cThe CHOP has become lawless and brutal.

The City has an obligation to protect their safety and essential services,\u201d she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in emailed comments.\nThe police action comes one day after city workers removed some barricades in response to a class action lawsuit by residents and business owners, fueling the debate over how to balance the right of peaceful assembly with the protection of property rights.\n\u2018UNPRECEDENTED DECISION\u2019\nFueled by chants of \u201cWhose streets? Our streets!\u201d, activists have led roving marches throughout Washington state\u2019s largest city for more than a month since the death of George Floyd, a Black man killed in Minneapolis police custody, sparked worldwide protests against racism.\nProtesters had been occupying several blocks in Capitol Hill since June 8, when police vacated their East Precinct station and moved street barricades to section off the area, dubbing it the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone.\nMayor Durkan\u2019s office said in a statement the aim of the move was to reduce tensions following a week of violent clashes between protesters and police.\nAbout 500 demonstrators created a makeshift camp behind the barricades, covering the abandoned precinct in graffiti which included a banner declaring \u201cThis space is now property of the Seattle people\u201d.\nThe occupation, now known as the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest (CHOP), started off largely festive.\nArtists painted murals commemorating Black lives, outdoor screenings showed documentaries about race, activists gave speeches on police brutality, and protesters and passersby converged at a \u201cconversation cafe\u201d.\nWhile the city provided portable bathrooms and trash pick-up, protesters insisted that police stay away.\nBut following four nights of gun violence since June 20 that left two Black teenagers dead and several injured, the mood has soured.\nNeighboring residents and business owners lament the lack of reliable police service, with some resorting to hiring private security, according to security firm Iconic Global.\nThey say their property rights have been infringed upon as their vehicles must navigate the barricades managed by the whims of protester volunteers, according to a class action lawsuit attorneys filed against the City of Seattle last month.\nNeighborhood businesses, residents and homeowners\u2019 associations highlighted the city\u2019s \u201cunprecedented decision to abandon and close off an entire city neighborhood, leaving it unchecked by the police, unserved by fire and emergency health services, and inaccessible to the public at large.\u201d\nThe lawsuit goes on to say that \u201cthe City\u2019s decision has subjected businesses, employees, and residents of that neighborhood to extensive property damage, public safety dangers, and an inability to use and access their properties.\u201d\nIn response to the lawsuit, this week city workers removed three of six concrete barriers that had been installed to improve traffic flow and ensure protester safety.\nProtesters quickly replaced the barricades with things like couches, plywood and signs.\nFRAGILE RELATIONSHIPS\nLawrence Yeh\u2019s sushi restaurant Momiji sits directly across the street from the precinct. He said the occupation has had little impact on his business.\nDespite the constantly changing barricade configuration, his deliveries have been arriving \u201c99% of the time\u201d and customers have come on foot unfettered, Yeh said.\n\u201cWe have a pretty good relationship with the protesters,\u201d Yeh added. \u201cIt varies block to block.\u201d\nOne block over, apartment dweller J. Cam Manny said his relationship with protesters has deteriorated.\nAfter attending daily meetings in the early days of the protest where activists tried to figure out their next steps, Manny said he has since been physically assaulted and threatened by protesters who chased him from his home.\nHe shared photos with the Thomson Reuters Foundation of vulgar messages directed at him by name spray painted on the sidewalk in front of his apartment building.\n\u201cI\u2019m now a CHOP refugee,\u201d he said, adding he was staying with his dog sitter in another neighbourhood and planned to wait a few days before returning home.\nOne protester who gave his name as Daniel P. disputed any bad blood between protesters and residents.\n\u201cWe have worked with every resident that has actually bothered to have communications with us,\u201d he said.\n\u201cEvery time when we have been asked to open up (the barricades), we have. We have done nothing but be respectful. We helped protect property when the cops didn\u2019t show up. We have done what the city departments would not do,\u201d he said.\nBALANCING RIGHTS\nThe tide gradually turned against the protesters, with even once-sympathetic voices calling for the area to be cleared.\n\u201cThe community initially embraced the CHOP as an alternative to police violence, joining in the call for change, a change we still demand,\u201d said Community Roots Housing and Capitol Hill EcoDistrict in an open letter.\nCommunity Roots is a neighborhood non-profit affordable housing developer whose properties near CHOP are home to nearly 700 low-income residents.\n\u201cBut what\u2019s happening in the area now has little to do with the movement for Black lives,\u201d the letter continued.\n\u201cMost of the activists have moved on. The park has become an encampment, our residents have been threatened and chased and businesses are being hurt.\u201d\nThe city has promised to preserve aspects of CHOP\u2019s legacy, like artwork, a Black Lives Matter street mural and a community garden.\nReporting by Gregory Scruggs, Editing by Jumana Farouky and Zoe Tabary.

Colorado and Utah primarily vote by mail, minimizing the problems with in-person voting that marred other elections during the coronavirus outbreak.\nHickenlooper, recruited to run by national Democrats after his failed presidential campaign last year, had been expected to coast to victory in Colorado but he was beset down the stretch by ethical violations and campaign gaffes, raising some doubts.\nHe acknowledged he misspoke in late May when he said during a discussion of the \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d movement that every life matters - a phrase criticized for dismissing racism against Black people. He also apologized after a six-year-old quip surfaced in which he compared a politician\u2019s schedule to working on a slave ship.\nHickenlooper was fined $2,750 by the Colorado Independent Ethics Commission on June 12 for violating state ethics laws by accepting free travel when he was governor. He initially defied a subpoena from the panel, testifying only after he was found in contempt.\nRepublicans said Hickenlooper\u2019s late stumbles showed he would be vulnerable against Gardner.\n\u201cIf watching him fall apart under pressure these last few weeks is any indication, \u2018hot mess\u2019 Hickenlooper is in for a very bumpy ride,\u201d said Joanna Rodriguez, a spokeswoman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee.\nDemocrats also learned the winner on Tuesday in the race for the U.S. Senate nomination in Kentucky, where the results were delayed a week by the counting of mailed ballots. Establishment-backed Amy McGrath held off a late surge by Black state lawmaker Charles Booker for the right to challenge Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell.\nIn Colorado, U.S. Representative Scott Tipton, who had been endorsed by Trump, was upset in a Republican primary by gun rights activist Lauren Boebert. She runs a gun-themed restaurant and has spoken favorably about the pro-Trump conspiracy theory QAnon, which says \u201cdeep-state\u201d traitors are plotting against the president.\nRepublicans were choosing challengers to run against U.S. Representatives Kendra Horn of Oklahoma and Ben McAdams of Utah, two endangered Democrats who represent districts that Trump carried in 2016.\nIn Oklahoma, the winner will be determined in an Aug. 25 runoff as no candidate managed 50% of the vote. In Utah, former National Football League player Burgess Owens won the Republican primary to take on McAdams.\nA ballot measure in Oklahoma to expand Medicaid, the government healthcare program for the poor and disabled, appeared to narrowly win despite the Republican governor\u2019s arguments the state cannot afford it.

It was near the end of the school half-term holiday.\nHe wrote on an official blog that there had been no new positive cases of the new coronavirus that week in the United Kingdom. It was a \u201ctestament,\u201d he said, \u201cto the robust infection control measures\u201d and the \u201cdiagnostic and testing work\u201d at laboratories nationwide.\nSelbie, who joked when he took his then \u00a3185,000-a-year job in 2013 that his public health credentials could be fitted \u201con a postage stamp,\u201d headed a government agency with a mission to prepare for and respond to public health emergencies. He was now facing an epochal one.\nPublic Health England (PHE) is a cornerstone of the UK\u2019s state-run health system; Selbie reports directly to the government\u2019s health minister, Matt Hancock.\nThe agency is much smaller and has a lower profile than the vast National Health Service (NHS) that oversees Britain\u2019s hospitals, clinics and general practitioners, providing healthcare to all. Public Health England\u2019s 5,500 staff have an important supporting role running laboratories, developing tests for new infections and managing outbreaks in England, home to 56 million of the UK\u2019s 67 million people.\nEven as Selbie posted his blog, all was not well. Reuters estimates that across the UK between 1,500 and 5,000 people may already have been infected with the coronavirus. The estimate is based on current scientific assessments of the fatality rate from COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, and an average interval from infection to death of between 18 and 23 days.\nWithin five weeks of Selbie\u2019s blog, Britain had hit the peak of an outbreak that has caused at least 43,000 deaths so far, according to the official toll. This compares to 35,000 in Italy, the first country in Europe to be severely affected, or nearly 9,000 in Germany, where, in the early days, the spread of infection appeared similar to Britain. With the exception only of Belgium, Britain has the highest per-capita mortality rate from COVID-19 among major economies, Reuters data show.\nAs Reuters has reported previously, Britain was slow to impose lockdown measures. That delay was costly. Professor Neil Ferguson, a disease modelling expert from Imperial College, London, has said that introducing lockdown measures a week earlier \u201cwould have reduced the final death toll by at least half.\u201d\nNow, a Reuters investigation reveals further missteps and failures by officials and government agencies, including Selbie\u2019s Public Health England, in testing, tracking and tracing. Among decisions that doctors and epidemiologists say cost lives were:\n\u2022 Failure to build up capacity to perform mass tests for COVID-19. \u2022 Deciding on a narrower definition of COVID-19 than used by the World Health Organization and other countries. \u2022 A decision to abandon testing of most people who didn\u2019t require hospitalization, and failure, early on, to create any way to track infection. \u2022 A decision to abandon a programme of widespread \u201ccontact tracing,\u201d in which people in contact with an infected person were traced and told to isolate to stop the outbreak spreading. \u2022 Deciding to share almost no details about the location of infections with local public health officials or the public. \u2022 Fragmenting local responsibility for public health.\n\u201cEvery mistake that was made did, unfortunately, cost lives,\u201d said Professor Tim Spector, an epidemiologist at King\u2019s College London.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has said his government followed scientific advice at all times. Ministers point out that from mid-April, the UK dramatically increased the number of tests carried out and recruited thousands of contact tracers to control outbreaks.\nIn a statement, Public Health England chief executive Selbie told Reuters his agency\u2019s work had helped to save lives. \u201cBeating this virus was always going to be a marathon not a sprint,\u201d Selbie said. \u201cIt remains our sole focus and we have done our absolute best with all our available resources.\u201d\nStill, as the country began emerging from its lockdown this month, there was another blow to the government. It was forced to delay until at least autumn a contact-tracing app that it had hoped would be a game changer in tracking the virus and averting a second wave of infection. It emerged the app didn\u2019t work properly with iPhones.\nINTO THE FOG\nOnce it surfaced, the virus spread rapidly in Britain. Infections peaked weeks earlier than the authorities expected not just in England, but in all parts of the UK.\nEngland\u2019s Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s top health adviser, recently conceded, \u201cMany of the problems we had came because we were unable to actually work out exactly where we were, and we were trying to see our way through the fog.\u201d\nSeveral senior doctors, who led the response to COVID-19 at major hospitals, told Reuters the fog was partly a result of early decisions by Whitty and other advisers that restricted testing for the virus. The doctors asked not to be named because they were not authorised by the NHS to speak publicly.\nPublic Health England had two main ways of monitoring and controlling the virus: a programme of testing and one of contact tracing to track down the contacts of anyone with the infection. These methods depended on what doctors call a \u201ccase definition,\u201d the description of what a COVID-19 case looks like, to determine who should be tested.\nIn early February, the World Health Organization listed eight symptoms for COVID-19, including nausea and vomiting. In Germany, the government\u2019s disease-control agency, the Robert Koch Institute, said doctors should use their judgment in ordering tests and it encouraged tests even for those with \u201cunspecified general symptoms,\u201d meaning mild symptoms.\nBritain took a different course. Whitty and his colleagues adopted a narrower view, defining COVID-19 symptoms as only a sharp new cough, fever or shortness of breath. Britain clung to this definition through the peak of the outbreak. It was not updated until May 18 \u2013 after 34,796 deaths \u2013 when a loss of taste and smell was added to the symptom list.\nSpector, the King\u2019s College professor, said Britain\u2019s refusal to recognize more symptoms created space for the virus to spread. Because testing was restricted to people exhibiting the UK\u2019s narrow range of symptoms, many cases likely went unnoticed and the virus spread unchecked.\n\u201cThe country that invented epidemiology was the only one that had no surveillance programme and no idea what was going on in their own country,\u201d he told Reuters.\nSeveral senior doctors said they had pleaded with the authorities to expand the case definition. But they got nowhere.\nOne London consultant said a Public Health England laboratory refused to accept test samples from patients who didn\u2019t meet the UK definition. Asked if this was true, a Public Health England spokesman said: \u201cThat is right, but there is nothing unusual in this. Lab testing capacity was used to establish whether people that met the case definition had the virus.\u201d\nBritain also restricted testing in other ways. At first it would test only those who had come into contact with confirmed cases and those with symptoms who had travelled from Wuhan, China, the origin of the outbreak, then from February 1 the rest of China, and six days later from other parts of Asia. Parts of Italy, the first European country to be badly hit by the virus, and Iran were added on February 25. Others were excluded.\n\u201cWe were testing all these people with a cough from China and parts of Asia,\u201d said one senior doctor at a London teaching hospital, but meanwhile cases from other countries passed unnoticed.\nCommunity testing in London, using the narrow guidelines, found only roughly 50 positive cases among some 5,000 tested by mid-March, another infectious disease specialist doctor in the capital said. Reuters has estimated that more than 18,000 Londoners were or had been infected with the virus by the end of February.\n\u201cA lot of us felt it was looking for a needle in a haystack,\u201d this doctor said.\nA large genetic study would later show that most UK infections had come from Europe, not Asia. Beginning in early February, the virus strain could be traced back to Italy, then Spain and France, a team from the University of Oxford and University of Edinburgh found.\nMany frontline doctors believe the disease was carried home to Britain from Europe\u2019s ski resorts. The biggest influx was when families returned from their half-term break, shortly after Selbie\u2019s February 21 blog post that celebrated recording no further cases.\nPublic Health England told Reuters it didn\u2019t set policy. The Department of Health and Social Care, Britain\u2019s health ministry, said the case definition was set by the government\u2019s top medical advisers, based on scientific advice. The definition was continually reviewed, the ministry said. \u201cThe symptoms selected were those that captured those most likely to have COVID-19, while not capturing a great number of people who did not,\u201d the department said in a response to Reuters.\nIn Scotland, which followed the same UK-wide case definition, there were also far more early cases than realised. In the Glasgow region, for instance, Reuters calculated there were at least 200 cases by the end of February. But, according to official data, there were no cases.\nWHO\u2019S IN CHARGE\nThe government would later concede the UK hadn\u2019t tested enough. Matt Hancock, the health minister, blamed a shortage of lab capacity. \u201cWe have the best scientific labs in the world, but we did not have the scale,\u201d he said in April. Germany, in contrast, \u201ccould call upon a hundred test labs, ready and waiting when the crisis struck.\u201d He did not specify how many labs the UK had.\nBut according to Mark Reed, general manager of Pro-Lab Diagnostics, a Canadian-owned company, that wasn\u2019t the case. \u201cEvery maker of diagnostics was saying \u2018We are here.\u2019 I don\u2019t think the government engaged enough; they underestimated what was required.\u201d\nReed and officials from two other diagnostic firms \u2013 Novacyt and GeneFirst Ltd \u2013 told Reuters that Public Health England evaluations of their testing kits were not completed until mid-to-late March. As a result, NHS labs were reluctant to use tests made by the three companies, they said. Public Health England told Reuters that although it carried out evaluations, it wasn\u2019t its job to approve or recommend tests. It didn\u2019t comment about these specific cases.\nBy contrast, laboratories in Germany began using commercially made tests from Jan. 27 and then validated new ones as they became available, said Evangelos Kotsopoulos, CEO at laboratory firm Sonic Healthcare Germany. Into February, \u201cwe simply grabbed every single instrument we could find,\u201d while hiring new lab staff and stockpiling crucial chemicals needed for testing.\nOf all countries, South Korea had best demonstrated the value of mass testing early in the pandemic, making use of commercially supplied kits. One, from South Korea\u2019s Seegene Inc, was not evaluated until mid-March by Public Health England. Based on that evaluation, NHS labs began purchasing and using it in early April. German labs had been using that test since mid-February.\nA spokesman for Public Health England said that, within the UK\u2019s overall strategy, the agency\u2019s role \u201cwas to provide an assured testing capability\u201d for the virus \u201cwhile commercial partners worked to develop their own capability.\u201d NHS labs were free to order and validate their own private test kits or develop their own, the agency said.\nThe heads of three NHS labs told Reuters otherwise: They said they had waited for Public Health England\u2019s evaluation before placing such orders.\nThe NHS didn\u2019t directly address a question from Reuters about the evaluation of tests by Public Health England. It said in a statement that overall policy on testing is set by the government, informed by advice from Public Health England. The statement added that \u201cas more reagent supplies became available, NHS-run laboratories were able to increase their capacity to test for COVID-19.\u201d\nThe bulk of tests for the coronavirus in the early stage of the outbreak was done within Public Health England\u2019s own labs. A clinical adviser to the government said the agency had been \u201cvery centralised\u201d and \u201cmade quite clear they are controlling all of the testing.\u201d\nAt the beginning, \u201cthe only game in town was the PHE test,\u201d agreed Allan Wilson, president of the Institute of Biomedical Science, which represents NHS laboratory staff.\nThe system wasn\u2019t designed for fast results.\nRavi Gupta, a Cambridge University professor of clinical microbiology, said patients at Cambridge\u2019s Addenbrooke\u2019s Hospital had likely infected others with the coronavirus while kept on wards waiting for test results. In the early weeks, he said, they had to wait two to four days. Gupta helped develop a 90-minute test.\nMembers of parliament\u2019s science committee criticised Public Health England in May for initially restricting testing to a small number of labs, calling it \u201cone of the most consequential\u201d decisions of the crisis. Selbie responded by stating the responsibility for testing policy lay with the government\u2019s health ministry, the Department of Health. \u201cPHE operates reference laboratories for novel and dangerous pathogens and would not be expected to operate mass testing programmes,\u201d he said.\nSILENT OUTBREAK\nIn Birmingham, the virus arrived unnoticed.\nZia Choudhry remembers his father, Mohamed Aslam Wassan, a 67-year-old retired businessman \u201cfull of love and full of energy\u201d coming home with a cough on March 15. Choudhry lived with his dad and his mother, together with his wife and children, in a house in Lozells, a district of Birmingham.\nIn the next few weeks, Wassan, remembered by some for bringing a famous snack, Bombay Mix, to the city, would die of COVID-19. So would four of his close friends, all well-known faces in the local Pakistani community. They were among at least 1,000 who would die across the city.\nUntil his father had taken ill, Choudhry recalled, there had been little sign that the epidemic had arrived. Up to that time, no death from COVID-19 had been recorded in this city of just over one million people. The city council had just issued a press release confirming a total of five local cases, and reminding citizens \u201cthe risk to the general public remains low.\u201d\nBut the infection had already been seeded. By Reuters calculations, based on later deaths, about 29,000 people were infected in Birmingham by that point.\nThere were grim days that followed. Eight days after his infection, Wassan was hospitalized. He was put on a ventilator the next day, and it was turned off after five more days. Choudhry could not attend his father\u2019s funeral.\nChoudhry believes the advice to socially isolate by staying at home, which did not come until March 23, should have come earlier. His father had been healthy enough to live much longer, he thinks. \u201cYou know, it was not his time,\u201d he said.\nSpeaking at a press conference in early June, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it was still too early to draw conclusions about early decisions. \u201cAll such judgments will need to be examined in the fullness of time,\u201d he said.\nIn interviews, seven directors of public health at large local authorities told Reuters they received little more information than the government released to the public on its website. The directors, who are employed by local authorities, not by Public Health England, said this lack of communication hampered their efforts to prevent the virus spreading.\n\u201cWe were flying blind,\u201d said Lisa McNally, director of public health in Sandwell, a district neighbouring Birmingham.\nMcNally said the government refused to share models used by its scientific advisers and the data that fed them. They wouldn\u2019t reveal, for example, how many people from her area were calling the NHS helpline with COVID-19 symptoms. If local officials had been kept informed there could have been special efforts to work out the source of infection, or an information campaign aimed at a particular area to reinforce the lockdown.\n\u201cWe basically would have done contact tracing,\u201d she said. Louise Smith, the director of health in the rural county of Norfolk, in eastern England, was angry that mortality and case data weren\u2019t shared by local hospitals. From March to mid-April, she said, \u201cI was finding out about the deaths by reading the local newspaper.\u201d\nIn Birmingham, the city\u2019s health director Justin Varney said when the first deaths occurred in early March, the national protocol was to get a personal call from Chris Whitty or his deputy. Varney\u2019s first call came from another official. He was given neither a name nor postcode of the victim. It was just the \u201cbarest minimum of details\u201d and he was told \u201cnot do anything with that until the NHS announced it.\u201d\nWhitty did not respond to a request for comment.\nAnd the information blackout continued. Throughout most of the outbreak, Birmingham\u2019s Varney, like other public health directors, was given no more detail about deaths and infections than was published on national websites, with the exception of information about outbreaks in nursing homes or other institutions. A breakdown of deaths by neighbourhood, which would have identified clusters like in Lozells, was not released until May 1.\nSecrecy was pervasive. Dr Helen Carter, Public Health England\u2019s deputy director in the Midlands, revealed in a May 15 memo to Birmingham councillors that the government had initially ordered the agency not to share with local councils its surveillance reports containing data about notified cases from local hospital emergency rooms and general practitioners.\n\u201cUntil April 2020 PHE was not permitted to share the surveillance reports with local partners by the Cabinet Office,\u201d she wrote in the memo, which is reported here for the first time. After April, information was shared with public health directors, but the reports remained official secrets and were \u201cmarked as official sensitive and not in the public domain,\u201d said the memo, which was reviewed by Reuters.\nPublic Health England declined requests by Reuters to interview Carter or any member of its staff involved in contact tracing. A spokesman said some of its surveillance reports were classified as \u201cofficial sensitive\u201d which, the spokesman said, was standard practice for non-public information. The agency had a \u201cconstant dialogue\u201d with local health directors, with \u201croutine exchanges of information and data,\u201d the spokesman added.\nThe government also restricted the power of local authorities to inform their communities about the spread of the virus. Health director Varney, who works for the city of Birmingham, said in the beginning there had been \u201ca complete embargo on local government doing proactive (communications) about COVID. At this stage, everything was being centrally controlled.\u201d\nA spokesman for the health ministry declined to respond to questions about its relationship with local health directors or its media strategy.\nIn Varney\u2019s view, communication was urgently needed to prevent misunderstandings about the virus taking hold and to target communities where many elderly people have poor English. He used a regulatory loophole to get the message out: He found he was allowed to talk about issues affecting \u201ccommunity cohesion.\u201d\nCALLING A HALT\nSophie Grenville and her husband, Mark, who manage a country estate in the county of Hampshire, took matters into their own hands.\nIt was early March when the couple tested positive for the coronavirus. She described her experiences later in a journal she shared with Reuters called \u201cA Diary of a Super Spreader.\u201d Her case illustrates the complexity and the slow pace of the early UK version of contact tracing.\nThe couple was tested for the virus after returning from a trip to Indonesia on Feb. 23. They developed what grew into a very distinctive, dry cough \u2013 like a fox or a deer barking \u2013 and reported it to the NHS helpline. They waited three days for a test. All the while, she wrote in the diary, she and her husband were thinking of the hundreds of people they recently had come into contact with at social and business events, from \u201cHigh Court judges to football chiefs.\u201d\nNurses in protective clothing visited their home on March 6 and took samples. The next day, they received the call with the positive test result, and later another call from an epidemiologist from Public Health England. Grenville said she was told the agency was only interested in people the couple had been in touch with when Grenville or her husband had recognizable symptoms.\nAt this point, Public Health England had been running a contact-tracing service for several weeks. When someone tested positive, they would get in touch and seek out potential contacts. In response to questions from Reuters, Public Health England said it couldn\u2019t comment on individual cases, but, \u201cWe followed the contact-tracing guidance that was in place at the time. This guidance stated that contacts should be traced from the point of notification of symptoms. This has changed as the knowledge of the virus has grown.\u201d Public Health England and the World Health Organization now recommend tracing contacts from two days before the onset of symptoms.\nEven by March, Public Health England\u2019s operation was under-resourced. Teams that usually dealt with food poisoning, measles or tuberculosis outbreaks had been drafted in.\nAccording to two senior doctors who were directly involved, the Public Health England teams were asked to cover huge regions. They didn\u2019t have the manpower to conduct serious contact tracing for measles, let alone COVID-19. Minutes of a February 18 meeting of the government\u2019s top scientific advisory committee, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), revealed that nationally Public Health England could then handle only five new cases per week. A spokesman for Public Health England told Reuters that reflected the complex international nature of early cases.\nSophie Grenville said that in her case contact tracers reached out to just two people \u2013 two sons the couple had taken out for dinner the night they had developed slight coughs. She and her husband decided to do their own contact tracing, alerting many other people they had recently encountered.\n\u201cWe were more upfront than we were advised we needed to be,\u201d Grenville said.\nShe recounted the chaotic scene in her diary: \u201cAll of Sunday we are making calls and discovering that all sorts of people we have seen have symptoms, some worse than others, and plenty we have seen are also completely fine. Everyone in our circle is having to tell their workplaces about their exposure and they are all shutting down.\u201d\nAbout 15 people the Grenvilles knew arranged to be tested, after reporting that they either had been in close contact with the couple or were exhibiting symptoms. Their farm manager tested positive, as well as a lady they had dropped in to see during the weekend, and two sons who had displayed no symptoms. Luckily, she said, none required hospitalization.\nMeanwhile, the actual source of the outbreak remained a mystery, including to Public Health England, Sophie Grenville recalled. She and her husband originally had been able to get tested because on their return from Indonesia they had changed planes in Malaysia, which was considered an early hot spot. But their symptoms hadn\u2019t developed for more than a week. That raised the possibility that they hadn\u2019t caught coronavirus in Southeast Asia, but in Britain. Scientists believe it takes up to 14 days to develop COVID-19 symptoms, but the average is four to five days.\nIndeed, on March 5, the government was told by SAGE that transmission in the community was underway. Five days later, the committee heard the UK \u201clikely has thousands of cases \u2013 as many as 5,000 to 10,000 \u2013 which are geographically spread nationally.\u201d That confirmed what many experts had suspected. Jason Strelitz, the director of public health in the east London borough of Newham, said from the end of February he began telling colleagues \u201ctime and time again\u201d to be under no illusion: official figures for COVID-19 were \u201ca massive underestimate.\u201d\nBased on analysis of the wave of deaths in the weeks that followed, and applying standard methods developed by research epidemiologists, Reuters calculates that Britain only detected about 3% of all COVID-19 infections so far, including those with no symptoms. This method may underestimate the rate of detection, however, when the epidemic spread into nursing homes and fatality rates were likely higher than average. Research by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine estimated the UK detected 18% of COVID-19 cases with clinical symptoms, compared to 43% in Germany.\nBut instead of ramping up testing and contact tracing across the country, the government brought the programme to a halt. On March 12, chief medical adviser Whitty announced from now on, \u201call of the testing capacity\u201d would be pivoted to testing people in hospital with symptoms. Anyone else who fell sick with suspected COVID-19 would have to cope \u2013 and advised not even to contact the health service unless their condition grew serious. And contact tracing was over in all but special cases, such as outbreaks in prisons or immigration centres.\nFor some who had spent their lives fighting disease, the decision to scale back contact tracing in the community came as a shock. Among them was David Heymann, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, one of the world\u2019s leading experts on infection control and a former chairman of Public Health England. He learned how to contact trace in 1976 when tracking the spread of smallpox in the slums of Kolkata, India.\nHe believes \u201cmodellers\u201d \u2014 who use data and assumptions to predict a disease\u2019s spread \u2014 carried too much weight in decisions. And they appeared to have conditioned policymakers, he felt, to believe the virus could not be stopped. \u201cI don\u2019t think any field epidemiologist would recommend to stop contact tracing in an outbreak.\u201d\nWhitty, the government\u2019s most senior medical adviser, didn\u2019t comment.\nPapers published by SAGE appear to support Heymann\u2019s suspicion that modelling scientists influenced the decision to stop routine contact tracing. SAGE\u2019s modelling committee said as early as February 3 that contact tracing \u201cis not practical once there are large numbers of cases.\u201d\nA further detailed study by three modellers from the University of Cambridge , Manchester University and Public Health England, submitted to SAGE on Feb. 12, argued that beyond a certain point in the outbreak, testing would be pointless. SAGE endorsed this paper on Feb. 18, according to published minutes, concluding that contact tracing would \u201cno longer be useful\u201d in the case of \u201csustained transmission\u201d of the virus.\nSome countries took a different approach. Just as Britain was shutting down its community tracing, Germany recruited an army of locally based contact tracers. In the southern city of Heidelberg and surrounding district of 800,000 people, local health director Rainer Schwertz told Reuters how by the second week of March, he had tripled the size of his department, recruiting 200 medical students to work on intensive tracing. By early June, just 38 people had died from COVID-19.\nA Public Health England spokesman said that contact tracing \u201cwas never abandoned.\u201d But once there was clear evidence of widespread, sustained community transmission of COVID-19, it was clear that contact tracing \u201cwas unlikely to control the outbreak alone and so was targeted where it could be most effective during this phase.\u201d The agency did not respond to a request for data showing what tracing continued.\nPublic health directors, nursing home managers and NHS staff interviewed by Reuters said they were not aware of any further tracing by Public Health England until the programme was relaunched in June.\nGOING IT ALONE\nTom Lewis, a consultant microbiologist at the Barnstaple hospital in north Devon, had spare capacity in his laboratory. He and his hospital team had tried in early April to offer testing for nursing home residents in the local community \u201cbecause nobody else was doing anything.\u201d But senior NHS executives ordered his team \u201cto back off. They said, this is not your job. This is a PHE job. So we said, \u2018fine.\u2019\u201d\nThe NHS didn\u2019t comment about the incident.\nLocal teams from Public Health England had done stellar tracing work in the early days of the outbreak, said Lewis. But then the \u201ccontract tracing stopped without really any warning and PHE then went very distant. I\u2019ve had almost no contact with PHE since then.\u201d\nHe said the agency was \u201cmassively over-stretched\u201d and it was unclear who was in charge.\nThis dysfunction was felt by some on the frontline. Roxanne Jenner-Ash, the manager of a Barnstaple nursing home, described a feeling of isolation at the height of the outbreak. \u201cThere was a point when no one wanted to support us,\u201d she said. Everyone \u2013 general practitioners, nurses and paramedics \u2013 all had different guidance and \u201ceveryone had different roles and opinions.\u201d At the same time, their residents were suffering: \u201cYou\u2019ve got people who can\u2019t feel heat, they can\u2019t make sense of what\u2019s going on, they can\u2019t communicate that they\u2019re in pain.\u201d\nAfter dealing with an outbreak in which nine residents died, Jenner-Ash was only sent swab kits to test her residents on May 9, when the infection had stopped spreading at the nursing home, at least for the time being.\nBut for Lewis the key thing was the absence of contact tracing \u2013 a real attempt to follow the spread of the virus, for example by interviewing and testing care workers who had been in contact with a COVID-positive patient, even if they had no symptoms.\nStarting in early May, Lewis and his NHS colleagues decided to launch their own wider tracing scheme. They followed contacts who tested positive at the Barnstaple hospital with the help of a sexual health adviser employed by the trust, Joanne Hamilton. Hamilton\u2019s work on sexually transmitted diseases had made her an experienced contact tracer.\nWhen another resident of her Pilton House nursing home tested positive in late May, this time, said Jenner-Ash, \u201cI was no longer alone.\u201d Within a day of the test result, Lewis and Hamilton had arranged for the entire staff of Pilton House to be tested \u2013 an exercise that uncovered a staff member who was positive and could then isolate, possibly saving the lives of others. Since then, Pilton House has remained COVID free.\nReuters learned there were small, similar experiments repeated across the country, in the highlands of Scotland, in the Lake District, in Wales, and in Sheffield, in northern England.\nBing Jones, a retired doctor who specialised in haematology, was one of a group of six retired medics who set up the Sheffield project. He said the national decision to stop contact tracing was a \u201ccatastrophic decision\u201d that has allowed the virus to travel largely unchecked across the United Kingdom and resulted in unnecessary deaths.\n\u201cIt is complete ineptitude. It was such a basic mistake. It is one of the basic planks of managing an epidemic,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was no reason why you couldn\u2019t have kept it going on a small scale or doing whatever you could.\u201d\nWorking with local general practitioners from mid-April, the group found 13 people with coronavirus symptoms, who generated 58 contacts.\nThey concluded that health and care workers may have been unwittingly passing on the virus. Judy Stewart, one of the volunteers on the Sheffield programme, said she contacted five nurses, including some who worked at a nearby hospital, to advise them to self-isolate after they were named as being in close contact with someone who had recently tested positive for COVID-19. Stewart said the nurses told her they discussed the request with their managers, but they were advised to ignore the request and keep working.\n\u201cThe resistance shocked me because of where it came from,\u201d she said. \u201cI got lots of texts back saying: \u2018sorry I can\u2019t be involved, but good luck and it was nice talking to you.\u2019\u201d\nBehind that resistance, some involved feared, was a concern among senior health service managers that too much testing and too much tracing of the contacts of healthcare workers would have \u2013 at a time of acute crisis \u2013 resulted in too many key staff taking time off work to isolate for at least the seven days mandated by the government.\nChris Morley, the chief nurse overseeing Sheffield\u2019s main hospitals, responded that the volunteer scheme was \u201cnot part of the Public Health England official Test and Trace System and our staff would therefore not necessarily have been aware of what it was or the legitimacy of the person asking them to self-isolate.\u201d\nIn London, the Francis Crick Institute, which runs a lab that has provided COVID-19 tests for hospitals, offered on April 15 to launch a programme to search for health workers who might be infected, even while showing no symptoms. University College London Hospitals conducted a month-long study of 200 healthcare workers from the end of March; 42 tested positive with the virus, but only eight had symptoms that met the official case definition. By the time of its offer, Crick had spare capacity to run at least 1,000 more tests a day.\nBut despite Crick\u2019s intensive lobbying to government ministers, NHS leaders and Selbie, the Public Health England chief, the testing programme was blocked, two sources with direct knowledge told Reuters.\nPublic Health England and the NHS referred questions about Crick\u2019s offer to the health ministry, the Department of Health, which told Reuters: \u201cThere was no guidance or instruction to NHS trusts to limit their testing programmes to hospital admissions.\u201d Increased capacity meant testing could now be extended to asymptomatic staff, a spokesperson said.\nOver the past two months, Britain finally ramped up community testing for the coronavirus and launched in late May what the prime minister called a \u201cworld-beating\u201d contact-tracing system staffed by thousands. But the new British smartphone app - heralded as a lynchpin of the contract-tracing system that was supposed to roll out last month - has been delayed. The government conceded the NHS COVID-19 App may not be ready until autumn at the earliest.\nreporting by Stephen Grey, Andrew MacAskill, Ryan McNeill, Steve Stecklow and Tommy Wilkes; additional reporting by Thomas Escritt and Paul Carrel in Berlin and Elizabeth Piper in London; edited by Janet McBride\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"url": "/article/idUSL8N2E75QX", "headline": "Universal Declaration of Human Rights inspires musical work, 'Voices'", "published_date": "2020-07-01", "text": "By Sarah Mills\n3 MIN READ\nLONDON - Composer Max Richter\u2019s new album \u201cVoices\u201d features narrators reading parts of the 70-year-old Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which he believes can stir hope in a world where we \u201clurch from crisis to crisis\u201d.\n His piece starts with the voice of Eleanor Roosevelt, first lady of the United States from 1933 to 1945, who was instrumental in setting up the Declaration in 1948 after World War Two.\nRoosevelt explains the Declaration is \u201cfor all peoples and all nations\u201d.

The sentence was so stiff it exceeded the jail time Alabama allows for negligent homicide.\nMarquita Johnson poses for a photo on the street where she was arrested at a police road block in Montgomery, Alabama, U.S., September 26, 2019. Picture taken September 26, 2019. REUTERS/Chris Aluka Berry\nMarquita Johnson, who was locked up in April 2012, says the impact of her time in jail endures today. Johnson\u2019s three children were cast into foster care while she was incarcerated. One daughter was molested, state records show. Another was physically abused.\n\u201cJudge Hayes took away my life and didn\u2019t care how my children suffered,\u201d said Johnson, now 36. \u201cMy girls will never be the same.\u201d\nFellow inmates found her sentence hard to believe. \u201cThey had a nickname for me: The Woman with All the Days,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThat\u2019s what they called me: The Woman with All the Days. There were people who had committed real crimes who got out before me.\u201d\nIn 2016, the state agency that oversees judges charged Hayes with violating Alabama\u2019s code of judicial conduct. According to the Judicial Inquiry Commission, Hayes broke state and federal laws by jailing Johnson and hundreds of other Montgomery residents too poor to pay fines. Among those jailed: a plumber struggling to make rent, a mother who skipped meals to cover the medical bills of her disabled son, and a hotel housekeeper working her way through college.\nHayes, a judge since 2000, admitted in court documents to violating 10 different parts of the state\u2019s judicial conduct code. One of the counts was a breach of a judge\u2019s most essential duty: failing to \u201crespect and comply with the law.\u201d\nDespite the severity of the ruling, Hayes wasn\u2019t barred from serving as a judge. Instead, the judicial commission and Hayes reached a deal. The former Eagle Scout would serve an 11-month unpaid suspension. Then he could return to the bench.\nUntil he was disciplined, Hayes said in an interview with Reuters, \u201cI never thought I was doing something wrong.\u201d\nThis week, Hayes is set to retire after 20 years as a judge. In a statement to Reuters, Hayes said he was \u201cvery remorseful\u201d for his misdeeds.\nCommunity activists say his departure is long overdue. Yet the decision to leave, they say, should never have been his to make, given his record of misconduct.\n\u201cHe should have been fired years ago,\u201d said Willie Knight, pastor of North Montgomery Baptist Church. \u201cHe broke the law and wanted to get away with it. His sudden retirement is years too late.\u201d\nHayes is among thousands of state and local judges across America who were allowed to keep positions of extraordinary power and prestige after violating judicial ethics rules or breaking laws they pledged to uphold, a Reuters investigation found.\nJudges have made racist statements, lied to state officials and forced defendants to languish in jail without a lawyer \u2013 and then returned to the bench, sometimes with little more than a rebuke from the state agencies overseeing their conduct.\nRecent media reports have documented failures in judicial oversight in South Carolina, Louisiana and Illinois. Reuters went further.\nIn the first comprehensive accounting of judicial misconduct nationally, Reuters reviewed 1,509 cases from the last dozen years \u2013 2008 through 2019 \u2013 in which judges resigned, retired or were publicly disciplined following accusations of misconduct. In addition, reporters identified another 3,613 cases from 2008 through 2018 in which states disciplined wayward judges but kept hidden from the public key details of their offenses \u2013 including the identities of the judges themselves.\nAll told, 9 of every 10 judges were allowed to return to the bench after they were sanctioned for misconduct, Reuters determined. They included a California judge who had sex in his courthouse chambers, once with his former law intern and separately with an attorney; a New York judge who berated domestic violence victims; and a Maryland judge who, after his arrest for driving drunk, was allowed to return to the bench provided he took a Breathalyzer test before each appearance.\nThe news agency\u2019s findings reveal an \u201cexcessively\u201d forgiving judicial disciplinary system, said Stephen Gillers, a law professor at New York University who writes about judicial ethics. Although punishment short of removal from the bench is appropriate for most misconduct cases, Gillers said, the public \u201cwould be appalled at some of the lenient treatment judges get\u201d for substantial transgressions.\nAmong the cases from the past year alone:\nIn Utah, a judge texted a video of a man\u2019s scrotum to court clerks. He was reprimanded but remains on the bench.\nIn Indiana, three judges attending a conference last spring got drunk and sparked a 3 a.m. brawl outside a White Castle fast-food restaurant that ended with two of the judges shot. Although the state supreme court found the three judges had \u201cdiscredited the entire Indiana judiciary,\u201d each returned to the bench after a suspension.\nIn Texas, a judge burst in on jurors deliberating the case of a woman charged with sex trafficking and declared that God told him the defendant was innocent. The offending judge received a warning and returned to the bench. The defendant was convicted after a new judge took over the case.\n\u201cThere are certain things where there should be a level of zero tolerance,\u201d the jury foreman, Mark House, told Reuters. The judge should have been fined, House said, and kicked off the bench. \u201cThere is no justice, because he is still doing his job.\u201d\nJudicial misconduct specialists say such behavior has the potential to erode trust in America\u2019s courts and, absent tough consequences, could give judges license to behave with impunity.\n\u201cWhen you see cases like that, the public starts to wonder about the integrity and honesty of the system,\u201d said Steve Scheckman, a lawyer who directed Louisiana\u2019s oversight agency and served as deputy director of New York\u2019s. \u201cIt looks like a good ol\u2019 boys club.\u201d\nThat\u2019s how local lawyers viewed the case of a longtime Alabama judge who concurrently served on the state\u2019s judicial oversight commission. The judge, Cullman District Court\u2019s Kim Chaney, remained on the bench for three years after being accused of violating the same nepotism rules he was tasked with enforcing on the oversight commission. In at least 200 cases, court records show, Judge Chaney chose his own son to serve as a court-appointed defense lawyer for the indigent, enabling the younger Chaney to earn at least $105,000 in fees over two years.\nIn February, months after Reuters repeatedly asked Chaney and the state judicial commission about those cases, he retired from the bench as part of a deal with state authorities to end the investigation.\nTommy Drake, the lawyer who first filed a complaint against Chaney in 2016, said he doubts the judge would have been forced from the bench if Reuters hadn\u2019t examined the case.\n\u201cYou know the only reason they did anything about Chaney is because you guys started asking questions,\u201d Drake said. \u201cOtherwise, he\u2019d still be there.\u201d\nBEDROCK OF AMERICAN JUSTICE\nState and local judges draw little scrutiny even though their courtrooms are the bedrock of the American criminal justice system, touching the lives of millions of people every year.\nThe country\u2019s approximately 1,700 federal judges hear 400,000 cases annually. The nearly 30,000 state, county and municipal court judges handle a far bigger docket: more than 100 million new cases each year, from traffic to divorce to murder. Their titles range from justice of the peace to state supreme court justice. Their powers are vast and varied \u2013 from determining whether a defendant should be jailed to deciding who deserves custody of a child.\nEach U.S. state has an oversight agency that investigates misconduct complaints against judges. The authority of the oversight agencies is distinct from the power held by appellate courts, which can reverse a judge\u2019s legal ruling and order a new trial. Judicial commissions cannot change verdicts. Rather, they can investigate complaints about the behavior of judges and pursue discipline ranging from reprimand to removal.\nFew experts dispute that the great majority of judges behave responsibly, respecting the law and those who appear before them. And some contend that, when judges do falter, oversight agencies are effective in identifying and addressing the behavior. \u201cWith a few notable exceptions, the commissions generally get it right,\u201d said Keith Swisher, a University of Arizona law professor who specializes in judicial ethics.\nRELATED COVERAGE\nTeflon Robe: 5 takeaways from Reuters' investigation of misconduct by U.S. judges\nHow Reuters examined misconduct by state and local judges across America\nOthers disagree. They note that the clout of these commissions is limited, and their authority differs from state to state. To remove a judge, all but a handful of states require approval of a panel that includes other judges. And most states seldom exercise the full extent of those disciplinary powers.\nAs a result, the system tends to err on the side of protecting the rights and reputations of judges while overlooking the impact courtroom wrongdoing has on those most affected by it: people like Marquita Johnson.\nReuters scoured thousands of state investigative files, disciplinary proceedings and court records from the past dozen years to quantify the personal toll of judicial misconduct. The examination found at least 5,206 people who were directly affected by a judge\u2019s misconduct. The victims cited in disciplinary documents ranged from people who were illegally jailed to those subjected to racist, sexist and other abusive comments from judges in ways that tainted the cases.\nThe number is a conservative estimate. The tally doesn\u2019t include two previously reported incidents that affected thousands of defendants and prompted sweeping reviews of judicial conduct.\nIn Pennsylvania, the state examined the convictions of more than 3,500 teenagers sentenced by two judges. The judges were convicted of taking kickbacks as part of a scheme to fill a private juvenile detention center. In 2009, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court appointed senior judge Arthur Grim to lead a victim review, and the state later expunged criminal records for 2,251 juveniles. Grim told Reuters that every state should adopt a way to compensate victims of judicial misconduct.\n\u201cIf we have a system that holds a wrongdoer accountable but we fail to address the victims, then we are really losing sight of what a justice system should be all about,\u201d Grim said.\nIn another review underway in Ohio, state public defender Tim Young is scrutinizing 2,707 cases handled by a judge who retired in 2018 after being hospitalized for alcoholism. Mike Benza, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University whose students are helping identify victims, compared the work to current investigations into police abuse of power. \u201cYou see one case and then you look to see if it\u2019s systemic,\u201d he said.\nThe review, which has been limited during the coronavirus pandemic, may take a year. But Young said the time-consuming task is essential because \u201ca fundamental injustice may have been levied against hundreds or thousands of people.\u201d\nSPECIAL RULES FOR JUDGES\nMost states afford judges accused of misconduct a gentle kind of justice. Perhaps no state better illustrates the shortcomings of America\u2019s system for overseeing judges than Alabama.\nAs in most states, Alabama\u2019s nine-member Judicial Inquiry Commission is a mix of lawyers, judges and lay people. All are appointed. Their deliberations are secret and they operate under some of the most judge-friendly rules in the nation.\nAlabama\u2019s rules make even filing a complaint against a judge difficult. The complaint must be notarized, which means that in theory, anyone who makes misstatements about the judge can be prosecuted for perjury. Complaints about wrongdoing must be made in writing; those that arrive by phone, email or without a notary stamp are not investigated, although senders are notified why their complaints have been summarily rejected. Anonymous written complaints are shredded.\nThese rules can leave lawyers and litigants fearing retaliation, commission director Jenny Garrett noted in response to written questions.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a ridiculous system that protects judges and makes it easy for them to intimidate anyone with a legitimate complaint,\u201d said Sue Bell Cobb, chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court from 2007 to 2011. In 2009, she unsuccessfully championed changes to the process and commissioned an American Bar Association report that offered a scathing review of Alabama\u2019s rules.\nIn most other states, commission staff members can start investigating a judge upon receiving a phone call or email, even anonymous ones, or after learning of questionable conduct from a news report or court filing. In Alabama, staff will not begin an investigation without approval from the commission itself, which convenes about every seven weeks.\nBy rule, the commission also must keep a judge who is under scrutiny fully informed throughout an investigation. If a subpoena is issued, the judge receives a simultaneous copy, raising fears about witness intimidation. If a witness gives investigators a statement, the judge receives a transcript. In the U.S. justice system, such deference to individuals under investigation is extremely rare.\n\u201cWhy the need for special rules for judges?\u201d said Michael Levy, a Washington lawyer who has represented clients in high-profile criminal, corporate, congressional and securities investigations. \u201cIf judges think it\u2019s fair and appropriate to investigate others for crimes or misconduct without providing those subjects or targets with copies of witness statements and subpoenas, why don\u2019t judges think it\u2019s fair to investigate judges in the same way?\u201d\nAlabama judges also are given an opportunity to resolve investigations confidentially. Reuters interviews and a review of Alabama commission records show the commission has met with judges informally at least 19 times since 2011 to offer corrective \u201cguidance.\u201d The identities of those judges remain confidential, as does the conduct that prompted the meetings. \u201cNot every violation warrants discipline,\u201d commission director Garrett said.\nSince 2008, the commission has brought 21 public cases against judges, including Hayes, charging two this year.\nTwo of the best-known cases brought by the commission involved Roy Moore, who was twice forced out as chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court for defying federal court orders.\nAnother Alabama justice fared better in challenging a misconduct complaint, however. Tom Parker, first elected to the state\u2019s high court in 2004, pushed back when the commission investigated him in 2015 for comments he made on the radio criticizing the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision legalizing gay marriage.\nParker sued the commission in federal court, arguing the agency was infringing on his First Amendment rights. He won. Although the commission had dropped its investigation before the ruling, it was ordered to cover Parker\u2019s legal fees: $100,000, or about a fifth of the agency\u2019s total annual budget.\nIn 2018, the people of Alabama elected Parker chief justice.\nThese days, Parker told Reuters, Alabama judges and the agency that oversees them enjoy \u201ca much better relationship\u201d that\u2019s less politically tinged. \u201cHow can I say it? It\u2019s much more respectful between the commission and the judges now.\u201d\n\u201cGUT INSTINCT\u201d\nMontgomery, Alabama has a deep history of racial conflict, as reflected in the clashing concepts emblazoned on the city\u2019s great seal: \u201cCradle of the Confederacy\u201d and \u201cBirthplace of the Civil Rights Movement.\u201d\nJefferson Davis was inaugurated here as Confederate president after the South seceded from the Union in 1861, and his birthday is a state holiday. As was common throughout the South, the city was the site of the lynchings of Black men, crimes now commemorated at a national memorial based here. Police arrested civil rights icon Rosa Parks here in 1955 for refusing to give up her seat on a city bus to a white passenger.\nToday, about 60% of Montgomery\u2019s 198,000 residents are Black, U.S. census records show. Even so, Black motorists account for about 90% of those charged with unpaid traffic tickets, a Reuters examination of court records found. Much of Judge Hayes\u2019 work in municipal court involved traffic cases and the collection of fines. Hayes, who is white, told Reuters that \u201cthe majority of people who come before the court are Black.\u201d\nCity officials have said that neither race nor economics have played a role in police efforts to enforce outstanding warrants, no matter how minor the offense.\nIn April 2012, Marquita Johnson was among them. Appearing before Hayes on a Wednesday morning, the 28-year-old single mother pleaded for a break.\nJohnson had struggled for eight years to pay dozens of tickets that began with a citation for failing to show proof of insurance. She had insurance, she said. But when she was pulled over, she couldn\u2019t find the card to prove it.\nEven a single ticket was a knockout blow on her minimum-wage waitress salary. In addition to fines, the court assessed a $155 fee to every ticket. Court records show that police often issued her multiple tickets for other infractions during every stop \u2013 a practice some residents call \u201cstacking.\u201d\nSlideshow ( 7 images )\nUnder state law, failing to pay even one ticket can result in the suspension of a driver\u2019s license. Johnson\u2019s decision to keep driving nonetheless \u2013 taking her children to school or to doctor visits, getting groceries, going to work \u2013 led to more tickets and deeper debt.\n\u201cI told Judge Hayes that I had lost my job and needed more time to pay,\u201d she recounted.\nBy Hayes\u2019 calculation, Johnson owed more than $12,000 in fines. He sentenced Johnson to 496 days in jail. Hayes arrived at that sentence by counting each day in jail as $25 toward the outstanding debt. A different judge later determined that Johnson actually owed half the amount calculated by Hayes, and that Hayes had incorrectly penalized her over fines she had already paid. To shave time off her sentence, Johnson washed police cars and performed other menial labor while jailed.\nHayes told Reuters that he generally found pleas of poverty hard to believe. \u201cWith my years of experience, I can tell when someone is being truthful with me,\u201d Hayes said. He called it \u201cgut instinct\u201d - though he added, in a statement this week, that he also consulted \u201ceach defendant\u2019s criminal and traffic history as well as their history of warrants and failures to appear in court.\u201d\nOf course, the law demands more of a judge than a gut call. In a 1983 landmark decision, Bearden v. Georgia, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that state judges are obligated to hold a hearing to determine whether a defendant has \u201cwillfully\u201d chosen not to pay a fine.\nAccording to the state\u2019s judicial oversight commission, \u201cJudge Hayes did not make any inquiry into Ms. Johnson\u2019s ability to pay, whether her non-payment was willful.\u201d\nFrom jail, \u201cI prayed to return to my daughters,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI was sure that someone would realize that Hayes had made a mistake.\u201d\nShe said her worst day in jail was her youngest daughter\u2019s 3rd birthday. From a jail telephone, she tried to sing \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d but slumped to the floor in grief.\n\u201cShe was choking up and crying,\u201d said Johnson\u2019s mother, Blanche, who was on the call. \u201cShe was devastated to be away from her children so long.\u201d\nWhen Johnson was freed after 10 months in jail, she learned that strangers had abused her two older children. One is now a teenager; the other is in middle school.\n\u201cMy kids will pay a lifetime for what the court system did to me,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cMy daughters get frantic when I leave the house. I know they\u2019ve had nightmares that I\u2019m going to disappear again.\u201d\nSix months after Johnson\u2019s release, Hayes jailed another single Black mother. Angela McCullough, then 40, had been pulled over driving home from Faulkner University, a local community college where she carried a 3.87 grade point average. As a mother of four children, including a disabled adult son, she had returned to college to pursue her dream of becoming a mental health counselor.\nPolice ticketed her for failing to turn on her headlights. After a background check, the officer arrested McCullough on a warrant for outstanding traffic tickets. She was later brought before Hayes.\n\u201cI can\u2019t go to jail,\u201d McCullough recalled pleading with the judge. \u201cI\u2019m a mother. I have a disabled son who needs me.\u201d\nHayes sentenced McCullough to 100 days in jail to pay off a court debt of $1,350, court records show. Her adult son, diagnosed with schizophrenia, was held in an institution until her release.\nMcCullough said she cleaned jail cells in return for time off her sentence. One day, she recalled, she had to clean a blood-soaked cell where a female inmate had slit her wrists.\nShe was freed after 20 days, using the money she saved for tuition to pay off her tickets, she said.\nJail was the darkest chapter of her life, McCullough said, a place where \u201cthe devil was trying to take my mind.\u201d Today, she has abandoned her pursuit of a degree. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be able to afford to go back.\u201d\nA clear sign that something was amiss in Montgomery courts came in November 2013, when a federal lawsuit was filed alleging that city judges were unlawfully jailing the poor. A similar suit was filed in 2014, and two more civil rights cases were filed in 2015. Johnson and McCullough were plaintiffs.\nThe lawsuits detailed practices similar to those that helped fuel protests in Ferguson, Missouri, after a white police officer killed a Black teenager in 2014. In a scathing report on the origins of the unrest, the U.S. Department of Justice exposed how Ferguson had systematically used traffic enforcement to raise revenue through excessive fines, a practice that fell disproportionately hard on Black residents.\n\u201cMontgomery is just like Ferguson,\u201d said Karen Jones, a community activist and founder of a local educational nonprofit. Jones has led recent protests in Montgomery in the wake of the killing of George Floyd, the Black man whose death under the knee of a cop in Minneapolis set off worldwide calls for racial justice.\nIn Montgomery, \u201ceverybody knew that the police targeted Black residents. And I sat in Hayes\u2019 court and watched him squeeze poor people for more money, then toss them in jail where they had to work off debts with free labor to the city.\u201d\nIt was years before the flurry of civil rights lawsuits against Hayes and his fellow judges had much impact on the commission. The oversight agency opened its Hayes case in summer 2015, nearly two years after plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers in the civil rights cases filed a complaint with the body. Hayes spent another year and a half on the bench before accepting the suspension.\nUnder its own rules, the commission could have filed a complaint and told its staff to investigate Hayes at any time. Commission director Garrett said she is prohibited by law from explaining why the commission didn\u2019t investigate sooner. The investigation went slowly, Garrett said, because it involved reviewing thousands of pages of court records. The commission also was busy with other cases from 2015 to early 2017, Garrett said, issuing charges against five judges, including Moore.\n\u201cSLAP IN THE FACE\u201d\nA few months after Judge Hayes\u2019 suspension ended, his term as a municipal judge was set to expire. So, the Montgomery City Council took up the question of the judge\u2019s future on March 6, 2018. On the agenda of its meeting: whether to reappoint Hayes to another four-year term.\nHayes wasn\u2019t in the audience that night, but powerful supporters were. The city\u2019s chief judge, Milton Westry, told the council that Hayes and his colleagues have changed how they handled cases involving indigent defendants, \u201csince we learned a better way of doing things.\u201d In the wake of the suits, Westry said, Hayes and his peers complied with reforms that required judges to make audio recordings of court hearings and notify lawyers when clients are jailed for failing to pay fines.\nAs part of a settlement in the civil case, the city judges agreed to implement changes for at least two years. Those reforms have since been abandoned, Reuters found. Both measures were deemed too expensive, Hayes and city officials confirmed.\nResidents who addressed the council were incredulous that the city would consider reappointing Hayes. Jones, the community activist, reminded council members that Hayes had \u201cpleaded guilty to violating the very laws he was sworn to uphold.\u201d\nThe city council voted to rehire Hayes to a fifth consecutive term.\nMarquita Johnson said she can\u2019t understand why a judge whose unlawful rulings changed the lives of hundreds has himself emerged virtually unscathed.\n\u201cHiring Hayes back to the bench was a slap in the face to everyone,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt was a message that we don\u2019t matter.\u201d\nOn Thursday, Hayes will retire from the bench. In an earlier interview with Reuters, he declined to discuss the Johnson case. Asked whether he regrets any of the sentences he has handed out, he paused.\n\u201cI think, maybe, I could have been more sympathetic at times,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cSometimes you miss a few.\u201d\nReporting By Michael Berens and John Shiffman.

It was near the end of the school half-term holiday.\nFILE PHOTO: Workers in protective suits disinfect a waiting hall at the Wuhan Railway Station which has been closed due to the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, in Wuhan, Hubei province, China March 24, 2020. cnsphoto via REUTERS/File Photo. To match Special Report HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/BRITAIN-TRACING ATTENTION EDITORS - THIS IMAGE WAS PROVIDED BY A THIRD PARTY. CHINA OUT.\nHe wrote on an official blog that there had been no new positive cases of the new coronavirus that week in the United Kingdom. It was a \u201ctestament,\u201d he said, \u201cto the robust infection control measures\u201d and the \u201cdiagnostic and testing work\u201d at laboratories nationwide.\nSelbie, who joked when he took his then \u00a3185,000-a-year job in 2013 that his public health credentials could be fitted \u201con a postage stamp,\u201d headed a government agency with a mission to prepare for and respond to public health emergencies. He was now facing an epochal one.\nPublic Health England (PHE) is a cornerstone of the UK\u2019s state-run health system; Selbie reports directly to the government\u2019s health minister, Matt Hancock.\nThe agency is much smaller and has a lower profile than the vast National Health Service (NHS) that oversees Britain\u2019s hospitals, clinics and general practitioners, providing healthcare to all. Public Health England\u2019s 5,500 staff have an important supporting role running laboratories, developing tests for new infections and managing outbreaks in England, home to 56 million of the UK\u2019s 67 million people.\nEven as Selbie posted his blog, all was not well. Reuters estimates that across the UK between 1,500 and 5,000 people may already have been infected with the coronavirus. The estimate is based on current scientific assessments of the fatality rate from COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, and an average interval from infection to death of between 18 and 23 days.\nWithin five weeks of Selbie\u2019s blog, Britain had hit the peak of an outbreak that has caused at least 43,000 deaths so far, according to the official toll. This compares to 35,000 in Italy, the first country in Europe to be severely affected, or nearly 9,000 in Germany, where, in the early days, the spread of infection appeared similar to Britain. With the exception only of Belgium, Britain has the highest per-capita mortality rate from COVID-19 among major economies, Reuters data show.\nAs Reuters has reported previously, Britain was slow to impose lockdown measures. That delay was costly. Professor Neil Ferguson, a disease modelling expert from Imperial College, London, has said that introducing lockdown measures a week earlier \u201cwould have reduced the final death toll by at least half.\u201d\nNow, a Reuters investigation reveals further missteps and failures by officials and government agencies, including Selbie\u2019s Public Health England, in testing, tracking and tracing. Among decisions that doctors and epidemiologists say cost lives were:\n\u2022 Failure to build up capacity to perform mass tests for COVID-19.\n\u2022 Deciding on a narrower definition of COVID-19 than used by the World Health Organization and other countries.\n\u2022 A decision to abandon testing of most people who didn\u2019t require hospitalization, and failure, early on, to create any way to track infection.\n\u2022 A decision to abandon a programme of widespread \u201ccontact tracing,\u201d in which people in contact with an infected person were traced and told to isolate to stop the outbreak spreading.\n\u2022 Deciding to share almost no details about the location of infections with local public health officials or the public.\n\u2022 Fragmenting local responsibility for public health.\n\u201cEvery mistake that was made did, unfortunately, cost lives,\u201d said Professor Tim Spector, an epidemiologist at King\u2019s College London.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has said his government followed scientific advice at all times. Ministers point out that from mid-April, the UK dramatically increased the number of tests carried out and recruited thousands of contact tracers to control outbreaks.\nIn a statement, Public Health England chief executive Selbie told Reuters his agency\u2019s work had helped to save lives. \u201cBeating this virus was always going to be a marathon not a sprint,\u201d Selbie said. \u201cIt remains our sole focus and we have done our absolute best with all our available resources.\u201d\nStill, as the country began emerging from its lockdown this month, there was another blow to the government. It was forced to delay until at least autumn a contact-tracing app that it had hoped would be a game changer in tracking the virus and averting a second wave of infection. It emerged the app didn\u2019t work properly with iPhones.\nINTO THE FOG\nOnce it surfaced, the virus spread rapidly in Britain. Infections peaked weeks earlier than the authorities expected not just in England, but in all parts of the UK.\nEngland\u2019s Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s top health adviser, recently conceded, \u201cMany of the problems we had came because we were unable to actually work out exactly where we were, and we were trying to see our way through the fog.\u201d\nSeveral senior doctors, who led the response to COVID-19 at major hospitals, told Reuters the fog was partly a result of early decisions by Whitty and other advisers that restricted testing for the virus. The doctors asked not to be named because they were not authorised by the NHS to speak publicly.\nPublic Health England had two main ways of monitoring and controlling the virus: a programme of testing and one of contact tracing to track down the contacts of anyone with the infection. These methods depended on what doctors call a \u201ccase definition,\u201d the description of what a COVID-19 case looks like, to determine who should be tested.\nIn early February, the World Health Organization listed eight symptoms for COVID-19, including nausea and vomiting. In Germany, the government\u2019s disease-control agency, the Robert Koch Institute, said doctors should use their judgment in ordering tests and it encouraged tests even for those with \u201cunspecified general symptoms,\u201d meaning mild symptoms.\nBritain took a different course. Whitty and his colleagues adopted a narrower view, defining COVID-19 symptoms as only a sharp new cough, fever or shortness of breath. Britain clung to this definition through the peak of the outbreak. It was not updated until May 18 \u2013 after 34,796 deaths \u2013 when a loss of taste and smell was added to the symptom list.\nSpector, the King\u2019s College professor, said Britain\u2019s refusal to recognize more symptoms created space for the virus to spread. Because testing was restricted to people exhibiting the UK\u2019s narrow range of symptoms, many cases likely went unnoticed and the virus spread unchecked.\n\u201cThe country that invented epidemiology was the only one that had no surveillance programme and no idea what was going on in their own country,\u201d he told Reuters.\nSeveral senior doctors said they had pleaded with the authorities to expand the case definition. But they got nowhere.\nOne London consultant said a Public Health England laboratory refused to accept test samples from patients who didn\u2019t meet the UK definition. Asked if this was true, a Public Health England spokesman said: \u201cThat is right, but there is nothing unusual in this. Lab testing capacity was used to establish whether people that met the case definition had the virus.\u201d\nBritain also restricted testing in other ways. At first it would test only those who had come into contact with confirmed cases and those with symptoms who had travelled from Wuhan, China, the origin of the outbreak, then from February 1 the rest of China, and six days later from other parts of Asia. Parts of Italy, the first European country to be badly hit by the virus, and Iran were added on February 25. Others were excluded.\n\u201cWe were testing all these people with a cough from China and parts of Asia,\u201d said one senior doctor at a London teaching hospital, but meanwhile cases from other countries passed unnoticed.\nCommunity testing in London, using the narrow guidelines, found only roughly 50 positive cases among some 5,000 tested by mid-March, another infectious disease specialist doctor in the capital said. Reuters has estimated that more than 18,000 Londoners were or had been infected with the virus by the end of February.\n\u201cA lot of us felt it was looking for a needle in a haystack,\u201d this doctor said.\nA large genetic study would later show that most UK infections had come from Europe, not Asia. Beginning in early February, the virus strain could be traced back to Italy, then Spain and France, a team from the University of Oxford and University of Edinburgh found.\nMany frontline doctors believe the disease was carried home to Britain from Europe\u2019s ski resorts. The biggest influx was when families returned from their half-term break, shortly after Selbie\u2019s February 21 blog post that celebrated recording no further cases.\nPublic Health England told Reuters it didn\u2019t set policy. The Department of Health and Social Care, Britain\u2019s health ministry, said the case definition was set by the government\u2019s top medical advisers, based on scientific advice. The definition was continually reviewed, the ministry said. \u201cThe symptoms selected were those that captured those most likely to have COVID-19, while not capturing a great number of people who did not,\u201d the department said in a response to Reuters.\nIn Scotland, which followed the same UK-wide case definition, there were also far more early cases than realised. In the Glasgow region, for instance, Reuters calculated there were at least 200 cases by the end of February. But, according to official data, there were no cases.\nWHO\u2019S IN CHARGE\nThe government would later concede the UK hadn\u2019t tested enough. Matt Hancock, the health minister, blamed a shortage of lab capacity. \u201cWe have the best scientific labs in the world, but we did not have the scale,\u201d he said in April. Germany, in contrast, \u201ccould call upon a hundred test labs, ready and waiting when the crisis struck.\u201d He did not specify how many labs the UK had.\nBut according to Mark Reed, general manager of Pro-Lab Diagnostics, a Canadian-owned company, that wasn\u2019t the case. \u201cEvery maker of diagnostics was saying \u2018We are here.\u2019 I don\u2019t think the government engaged enough; they underestimated what was required.\u201d\nRELATED COVERAGE\nBritain's COVID-19 app: The game changer that wasn't\nReed and officials from two other diagnostic firms \u2013 Novacyt and GeneFirst Ltd \u2013 told Reuters that Public Health England evaluations of their testing kits were not completed until mid-to-late March. As a result, NHS labs were reluctant to use tests made by the three companies, they said. Public Health England told Reuters that although it carried out evaluations, it wasn\u2019t its job to approve or recommend tests. It didn\u2019t comment about these specific cases.\nBy contrast, laboratories in Germany began using commercially made tests from Jan. 27 and then validated new ones as they became available, said Evangelos Kotsopoulos, CEO at laboratory firm Sonic Healthcare Germany. Into February, \u201cwe simply grabbed every single instrument we could find,\u201d while hiring new lab staff and stockpiling crucial chemicals needed for testing.\nOf all countries, South Korea had best demonstrated the value of mass testing early in the pandemic, making use of commercially supplied kits. One, from South Korea\u2019s Seegene Inc, was not evaluated until mid-March by Public Health England. Based on that evaluation, NHS labs began purchasing and using it in early April. German labs had been using that test since mid-February.\nA spokesman for Public Health England said that, within the UK\u2019s overall strategy, the agency\u2019s role \u201cwas to provide an assured testing capability\u201d for the virus \u201cwhile commercial partners worked to develop their own capability.\u201d NHS labs were free to order and validate their own private test kits or develop their own, the agency said.\nThe heads of three NHS labs told Reuters otherwise: They said they had waited for Public Health England\u2019s evaluation before placing such orders.\nThe NHS didn\u2019t directly address a question from Reuters about the evaluation of tests by Public Health England. It said in a statement that overall policy on testing is set by the government, informed by advice from Public Health England. The statement added that \u201cas more reagent supplies became available, NHS-run laboratories were able to increase their capacity to test for COVID-19.\u201d\nThe bulk of tests for the coronavirus in the early stage of the outbreak was done within Public Health England\u2019s own labs. A clinical adviser to the government said the agency had been \u201cvery centralised\u201d and \u201cmade quite clear they are controlling all of the testing.\u201d\nAt the beginning, \u201cthe only game in town was the PHE test,\u201d agreed Allan Wilson, president of the Institute of Biomedical Science, which represents NHS laboratory staff.\nThe system wasn\u2019t designed for fast results.\nRavi Gupta, a Cambridge University professor of clinical microbiology, said patients at Cambridge\u2019s Addenbrooke\u2019s Hospital had likely infected others with the coronavirus while kept on wards waiting for test results. In the early weeks, he said, they had to wait two to four days. Gupta helped develop a 90-minute test.\nMembers of parliament\u2019s science committee criticised Public Health England in May for initially restricting testing to a small number of labs, calling it \u201cone of the most consequential\u201d decisions of the crisis. Selbie responded by stating the responsibility for testing policy lay with the government\u2019s health ministry, the Department of Health. \u201cPHE operates reference laboratories for novel and dangerous pathogens and would not be expected to operate mass testing programmes,\u201d he said.\nSILENT OUTBREAK\nIn Birmingham, the virus arrived unnoticed.\nZia Choudhry remembers his father, Mohamed Aslam Wassan, a 67-year-old retired businessman \u201cfull of love and full of energy\u201d coming home with a cough on March 15. Choudhry lived with his dad and his mother, together with his wife and children, in a house in Lozells, a district of Birmingham.\nIn the next few weeks, Wassan, remembered by some for bringing a famous snack, Bombay Mix, to the city, would die of COVID-19. So would four of his close friends, all well-known faces in the local Pakistani community. They were among at least 1,000 who would die across the city.\nUntil his father had taken ill, Choudhry recalled, there had been little sign that the epidemic had arrived. Up to that time, no death from COVID-19 had been recorded in this city of just over one million people. The city council had just issued a press release confirming a total of five local cases, and reminding citizens \u201cthe risk to the general public remains low.\u201d\nBut the infection had already been seeded. By Reuters calculations, based on later deaths, about 29,000 people were infected in Birmingham by that point.\nThere were grim days that followed. Eight days after his infection, Wassan was hospitalized. He was put on a ventilator the next day, and it was turned off after five more days. Choudhry could not attend his father\u2019s funeral.\nChoudhry believes the advice to socially isolate by staying at home, which did not come until March 23, should have come earlier. His father had been healthy enough to live much longer, he thinks. \u201cYou know, it was not his time,\u201d he said.\nSpeaking at a press conference in early June, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it was still too early to draw conclusions about early decisions. \u201cAll such judgments will need to be examined in the fullness of time,\u201d he said.\nIn interviews, seven directors of public health at large local authorities told Reuters they received little more information than the government released to the public on its website. The directors, who are employed by local authorities, not by Public Health England, said this lack of communication hampered their efforts to prevent the virus spreading.\n\u201cWe were flying blind,\u201d said Lisa McNally, director of public health in Sandwell, a district neighbouring Birmingham.\nMcNally said the government refused to share models used by its scientific advisers and the data that fed them. They wouldn\u2019t reveal, for example, how many people from her area were calling the NHS helpline with COVID-19 symptoms. If local officials had been kept informed there could have been special efforts to work out the source of infection, or an information campaign aimed at a particular area to reinforce the lockdown.\n\u201cWe basically would have done contact tracing,\u201d she said.\nLouise Smith, the director of health in the rural county of Norfolk, in eastern England, was angry that mortality and case data weren\u2019t shared by local hospitals. From March to mid-April, she said, \u201cI was finding out about the deaths by reading the local newspaper.\u201d\nIn Birmingham, the city\u2019s health director Justin Varney said when the first deaths occurred in early March, the national protocol was to get a personal call from Chris Whitty or his deputy. Varney\u2019s first call came from another official. He was given neither a name nor postcode of the victim. It was just the \u201cbarest minimum of details\u201d and he was told \u201cnot do anything with that until the NHS announced it.\u201d\nWhitty did not respond to a request for comment.\nAnd the information blackout continued. Throughout most of the outbreak, Birmingham\u2019s Varney, like other public health directors, was given no more detail about deaths and infections than was published on national websites, with the exception of information about outbreaks in nursing homes or other institutions. A breakdown of deaths by neighbourhood, which would have identified clusters like in Lozells, was not released until May 1.\nSecrecy was pervasive. Dr Helen Carter, Public Health England\u2019s deputy director in the Midlands, revealed in a May 15 memo to Birmingham councillors that the government had initially ordered the agency not to share with local councils its surveillance reports containing data about notified cases from local hospital emergency rooms and general practitioners.\n\u201cUntil April 2020 PHE was not permitted to share the surveillance reports with local partners by the Cabinet Office,\u201d she wrote in the memo, which is reported here for the first time. After April, information was shared with public health directors, but the reports remained official secrets and were \u201cmarked as official sensitive and not in the public domain,\u201d said the memo, which was reviewed by Reuters.\nPublic Health England declined requests by Reuters to interview Carter or any member of its staff involved in contact tracing. A spokesman said some of its surveillance reports were classified as \u201cofficial sensitive\u201d which, the spokesman said, was standard practice for non-public information. The agency had a \u201cconstant dialogue\u201d with local health directors, with \u201croutine exchanges of information and data,\u201d the spokesman added.\nThe government also restricted the power of local authorities to inform their communities about the spread of the virus. Health director Varney, who works for the city of Birmingham, said in the beginning there had been \u201ca complete embargo on local government doing proactive (communications) about COVID. At this stage, everything was being centrally controlled.\u201d\nA spokesman for the health ministry declined to respond to questions about its relationship with local health directors or its media strategy.\nIn Varney\u2019s view, communication was urgently needed to prevent misunderstandings about the virus taking hold and to target communities where many elderly people have poor English. He used a regulatory loophole to get the message out: He found he was allowed to talk about issues affecting \u201ccommunity cohesion.\u201d\nCALLING A HALT\nSophie Grenville and her husband, Mark, who manage a country estate in the county of Hampshire, took matters into their own hands.\nIt was early March when the couple tested positive for the coronavirus. She described her experiences later in a journal she shared with Reuters called \u201cA Diary of a Super Spreader.\u201d Her case illustrates the complexity and the slow pace of the early UK version of contact tracing.\nThe couple was tested for the virus after returning from a trip to Indonesia on Feb. 23. They developed what grew into a very distinctive, dry cough \u2013 like a fox or a deer barking \u2013 and reported it to the NHS helpline. They waited three days for a test. All the while, she wrote in the diary, she and her husband were thinking of the hundreds of people they recently had come into contact with at social and business events, from \u201cHigh Court judges to football chiefs.\u201d\nNurses in protective clothing visited their home on March 6 and took samples. The next day, they received the call with the positive test result, and later another call from an epidemiologist from Public Health England. Grenville said she was told the agency was only interested in people the couple had been in touch with when Grenville or her husband had recognizable symptoms.\nAt this point, Public Health England had been running a contact-tracing service for several weeks. When someone tested positive, they would get in touch and seek out potential contacts. In response to questions from Reuters, Public Health England said it couldn\u2019t comment on individual cases, but, \u201cWe followed the contact-tracing guidance that was in place at the time. This guidance stated that contacts should be traced from the point of notification of symptoms. This has changed as the knowledge of the virus has grown.\u201d Public Health England and the World Health Organization now recommend tracing contacts from two days before the onset of symptoms.\nSlideshow ( 20 images )\nEven by March, Public Health England\u2019s operation was under-resourced. Teams that usually dealt with food poisoning, measles or tuberculosis outbreaks had been drafted in.\nAccording to two senior doctors who were directly involved, the Public Health England teams were asked to cover huge regions. They didn\u2019t have the manpower to conduct serious contact tracing for measles, let alone COVID-19. Minutes of a February 18 meeting of the government\u2019s top scientific advisory committee, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), revealed that nationally Public Health England could then handle only five new cases per week. A spokesman for Public Health England told Reuters that reflected the complex international nature of early cases.\nSophie Grenville said that in her case contact tracers reached out to just two people \u2013 two sons the couple had taken out for dinner the night they had developed slight coughs. She and her husband decided to do their own contact tracing, alerting many other people they had recently encountered.\n\u201cWe were more upfront than we were advised we needed to be,\u201d Grenville said.\nShe recounted the chaotic scene in her diary: \u201cAll of Sunday we are making calls and discovering that all sorts of people we have seen have symptoms, some worse than others, and plenty we have seen are also completely fine. Everyone in our circle is having to tell their workplaces about their exposure and they are all shutting down.\u201d\nAbout 15 people the Grenvilles knew arranged to be tested, after reporting that they either had been in close contact with the couple or were exhibiting symptoms. Their farm manager tested positive, as well as a lady they had dropped in to see during the weekend, and two sons who had displayed no symptoms. Luckily, she said, none required hospitalization.\nMeanwhile, the actual source of the outbreak remained a mystery, including to Public Health England, Sophie Grenville recalled. She and her husband originally had been able to get tested because on their return from Indonesia they had changed planes in Malaysia, which was considered an early hot spot. But their symptoms hadn\u2019t developed for more than a week. That raised the possibility that they hadn\u2019t caught coronavirus in Southeast Asia, but in Britain. Scientists believe it takes up to 14 days to develop COVID-19 symptoms, but the average is four to five days.\nIndeed, on March 5, the government was told by SAGE that transmission in the community was underway. Five days later, the committee heard the UK \u201clikely has thousands of cases \u2013 as many as 5,000 to 10,000 \u2013 which are geographically spread nationally.\u201d That confirmed what many experts had suspected. Jason Strelitz, the director of public health in the east London borough of Newham, said from the end of February he began telling colleagues \u201ctime and time again\u201d to be under no illusion: official figures for COVID-19 were \u201ca massive underestimate.\u201d\nBased on analysis of the wave of deaths in the weeks that followed, and applying standard methods developed by research epidemiologists, Reuters calculates that Britain only detected about 3% of all COVID-19 infections so far, including those with no symptoms. This method may underestimate the rate of detection, however, when the epidemic spread into nursing homes and fatality rates were likely higher than average. Research by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine estimated the UK detected 18% of COVID-19 cases with clinical symptoms, compared to 43% in Germany.\nBut instead of ramping up testing and contact tracing across the country, the government brought the programme to a halt. On March 12, chief medical adviser Whitty announced from now on, \u201call of the testing capacity\u201d would be pivoted to testing people in hospital with symptoms. Anyone else who fell sick with suspected COVID-19 would have to cope \u2013 and advised not even to contact the health service unless their condition grew serious. And contact tracing was over in all but special cases, such as outbreaks in prisons or immigration centres.\nFor some who had spent their lives fighting disease, the decision to scale back contact tracing in the community came as a shock. Among them was David Heymann, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, one of the world\u2019s leading experts on infection control and a former chairman of Public Health England. He learned how to contact trace in 1976 when tracking the spread of smallpox in the slums of Kolkata, India.\nHe believes \u201cmodellers\u201d \u2014 who use data and assumptions to predict a disease\u2019s spread \u2014 carried too much weight in decisions. And they appeared to have conditioned policymakers, he felt, to believe the virus could not be stopped. \u201cI don\u2019t think any field epidemiologist would recommend to stop contact tracing in an outbreak.\u201d\nWhitty, the government\u2019s most senior medical adviser, didn\u2019t comment.\nPapers published by SAGE appear to support Heymann\u2019s suspicion that modelling scientists influenced the decision to stop routine contact tracing. SAGE\u2019s modelling committee said as early as February 3 that contact tracing \u201cis not practical once there are large numbers of cases.\u201d\nA further detailed study by three modellers from the University of Cambridge , Manchester University and Public Health England, submitted to SAGE on Feb. 12, argued that beyond a certain point in the outbreak, testing would be pointless. SAGE endorsed this paper on Feb. 18, according to published minutes, concluding that contact tracing would \u201cno longer be useful\u201d in the case of \u201csustained transmission\u201d of the virus.\nSome countries took a different approach. Just as Britain was shutting down its community tracing, Germany recruited an army of locally based contact tracers. In the southern city of Heidelberg and surrounding district of 800,000 people, local health director Rainer Schwertz told Reuters how by the second week of March, he had tripled the size of his department, recruiting 200 medical students to work on intensive tracing. By early June, just 38 people had died from COVID-19.\nA Public Health England spokesman said that contact tracing \u201cwas never abandoned.\u201d But once there was clear evidence of widespread, sustained community transmission of COVID-19, it was clear that contact tracing \u201cwas unlikely to control the outbreak alone and so was targeted where it could be most effective during this phase.\u201d The agency did not respond to a request for data showing what tracing continued.\nPublic health directors, nursing home managers and NHS staff interviewed by Reuters said they were not aware of any further tracing by Public Health England until the programme was relaunched in June.\nGOING IT ALONE\nTom Lewis, a consultant microbiologist at the Barnstaple hospital in north Devon, had spare capacity in his laboratory. He and his hospital team had tried in early April to offer testing for nursing home residents in the local community \u201cbecause nobody else was doing anything.\u201d But senior NHS executives ordered his team \u201cto back off. They said, this is not your job. This is a PHE job. So we said, \u2018fine.\u2019\u201d\nThe NHS didn\u2019t comment about the incident.\nLocal teams from Public Health England had done stellar tracing work in the early days of the outbreak, said Lewis. But then the \u201ccontract tracing stopped without really any warning and PHE then went very distant. I\u2019ve had almost no contact with PHE since then.\u201d\nHe said the agency was \u201cmassively over-stretched\u201d and it was unclear who was in charge.\nThis dysfunction was felt by some on the frontline. Roxanne Jenner-Ash, the manager of a Barnstaple nursing home, described a feeling of isolation at the height of the outbreak. \u201cThere was a point when no one wanted to support us,\u201d she said. Everyone \u2013 general practitioners, nurses and paramedics \u2013 all had different guidance and \u201ceveryone had different roles and opinions.\u201d At the same time, their residents were suffering: \u201cYou\u2019ve got people who can\u2019t feel heat, they can\u2019t make sense of what\u2019s going on, they can\u2019t communicate that they\u2019re in pain.\u201d\nAfter dealing with an outbreak in which nine residents died, Jenner-Ash was only sent swab kits to test her residents on May 9, when the infection had stopped spreading at the nursing home, at least for the time being.\nBut for Lewis the key thing was the absence of contact tracing \u2013 a real attempt to follow the spread of the virus, for example by interviewing and testing care workers who had been in contact with a COVID-positive patient, even if they had no symptoms.\nStarting in early May, Lewis and his NHS colleagues decided to launch their own wider tracing scheme. They followed contacts who tested positive at the Barnstaple hospital with the help of a sexual health adviser employed by the trust, Joanne Hamilton. Hamilton\u2019s work on sexually transmitted diseases had made her an experienced contact tracer.\nWhen another resident of her Pilton House nursing home tested positive in late May, this time, said Jenner-Ash, \u201cI was no longer alone.\u201d Within a day of the test result, Lewis and Hamilton had arranged for the entire staff of Pilton House to be tested \u2013 an exercise that uncovered a staff member who was positive and could then isolate, possibly saving the lives of others. Since then, Pilton House has remained COVID free.\nReuters learned there were small, similar experiments repeated across the country, in the highlands of Scotland, in the Lake District, in Wales, and in Sheffield, in northern England.\nBing Jones, a retired doctor who specialised in haematology, was one of a group of six retired medics who set up the Sheffield project. He said the national decision to stop contact tracing was a \u201ccatastrophic decision\u201d that has allowed the virus to travel largely unchecked across the United Kingdom and resulted in unnecessary deaths.\n\u201cIt is complete ineptitude. It was such a basic mistake. It is one of the basic planks of managing an epidemic,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was no reason why you couldn\u2019t have kept it going on a small scale or doing whatever you could.\u201d\nWorking with local general practitioners from mid-April, the group found 13 people with coronavirus symptoms, who generated 58 contacts.\nThey concluded that health and care workers may have been unwittingly passing on the virus. Judy Stewart, one of the volunteers on the Sheffield programme, said she contacted five nurses, including some who worked at a nearby hospital, to advise them to self-isolate after they were named as being in close contact with someone who had recently tested positive for COVID-19. Stewart said the nurses told her they discussed the request with their managers, but they were advised to ignore the request and keep working.\n\u201cThe resistance shocked me because of where it came from,\u201d she said. \u201cI got lots of texts back saying: \u2018sorry I can\u2019t be involved, but good luck and it was nice talking to you.\u2019\u201d\nBehind that resistance, some involved feared, was a concern among senior health service managers that too much testing and too much tracing of the contacts of healthcare workers would have \u2013 at a time of acute crisis \u2013 resulted in too many key staff taking time off work to isolate for at least the seven days mandated by the government.\nChris Morley, the chief nurse overseeing Sheffield\u2019s main hospitals, responded that the volunteer scheme was \u201cnot part of the Public Health England official Test and Trace System and our staff would therefore not necessarily have been aware of what it was or the legitimacy of the person asking them to self-isolate.\u201d\nIn London, the Francis Crick Institute, which runs a lab that has provided COVID-19 tests for hospitals, offered on April 15 to launch a programme to search for health workers who might be infected, even while showing no symptoms. University College London Hospitals conducted a month-long study of 200 healthcare workers from the end of March; 42 tested positive with the virus, but only eight had symptoms that met the official case definition. By the time of its offer, Crick had spare capacity to run at least 1,000 more tests a day.\nBut despite Crick\u2019s intensive lobbying to government ministers, NHS leaders and Selbie, the Public Health England chief, the testing programme was blocked, two sources with direct knowledge told Reuters.\nPublic Health England and the NHS referred questions about Crick\u2019s offer to the health ministry, the Department of Health, which told Reuters: \u201cThere was no guidance or instruction to NHS trusts to limit their testing programmes to hospital admissions.\u201d Increased capacity meant testing could now be extended to asymptomatic staff, a spokesperson said.\nOver the past two months, Britain finally ramped up community testing for the coronavirus and launched in late May what the prime minister called a \u201cworld-beating\u201d contact-tracing system staffed by thousands. But the new British smartphone app - heralded as a lynchpin of the contract-tracing system that was supposed to roll out last month - has been delayed. The government conceded the NHS COVID-19 App may not be ready until autumn at the earliest.\nreporting by Stephen Grey, Andrew MacAskill, Ryan McNeill, Steve Stecklow and Tommy Wilkes; additional reporting by Thomas Escritt and Paul Carrel in Berlin and Elizabeth Piper in London; edited by Janet McBride\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"url": "/article/idUSKBN23Z0I9", "headline": "Trump retweets, then deletes, video of supporter shouting 'white power'", "published_date": "2020-06-28", "text": "By Reuters Staff\n3 MIN READ\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump retweeted a video showing one of his supporters in Florida shouting \u201cwhite power\u201d at protesters of his administration, drawing rebukes from allies and adversaries as protests continue in the aftermath of George Floyd\u2019s death.\n The video on Twitter, which was later deleted from the president\u2019s feed, showed Trump protesters and supporters in Florida shouting profanities at each other.

As America\u2019s inspector general for pandemic relief, he\u2019s charged with rooting out fraud in the spending of trillions of dollars in emergency aid.\nFILE PHOTO: White House lawyer Brian Miller, nominated by U.S. President Donald Trump to be the Treasury Department's Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery, is sworn in during a U.S. Senate Banking Committee confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., May 5, 2020. Alex Wong/Pool via REUTERS\nBut before even starting work, he was blasted by Democratic lawmakers who say he\u2019ll be more of a lapdog than watchdog, citing his recent history as a lawyer in Donald Trump\u2019s White House. And Trump himself - who in recent months has ousted a raft of inspectors general, prosecutors and other officials - signaled that he\u2019ll keep Miller on a tight leash, forbidding him from reporting to Congress without \u201cpresidential supervision.\u201d\nHow Miller, a Trump appointee, handles such pressures will test the administration\u2019s willingness - or lack of it - to demand accountability in pandemic relief spending. Miller\u2019s response also could make or break the reputation the veteran prosecutor and inspector general has built over decades.\nReuters interviewed more than two dozen people who know Miller or have insight into the job confronting him to understand how he might tackle it. Supporters from across the political spectrum expect Miller to investigate aggressively and impartially. They say he has prosecuted high-profile cases and weathered political controversy as an inspector general - including an uproar over an investigation he led that forced the resignation of the Republican chief of the General Services Administration (GSA).\nBut the new post - Special Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery - poses far higher logistical and political hurdles for the 64-year-old attorney, a Presbyterian elder who married his high school sweetheart and lives in a modest ranch house in Fredericksburg, Va.\nMiller declined to comment for this story. He acknowledged that the position will be \u201cvery challenging and demanding\u201d during his Congressional vetting on May 5.\nGordon Heddell, who has served inspector-general stints at the Labor and Defense departments, called Miller\u2019s work \u201coutstanding\u201d in his job at the GSA. Still, Heddell said, any inspector general under Trump has to expect \u201ca day of reckoning.\u201d\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Matthews declined to comment on concerns that Miller\u2019s independence could be compromised by his recent White House work and Trump\u2019s record of firing inspector generals.\nMiller\u2019s appointment, announced in April, places him at the center of a roiling battle over transparency in pandemic spending. The administration initially fought to keep secret the names and loan amounts of recipients in a $660 billion program offering forgivable loans to businesses. The Treasury Department has since agreed to disclose information for awards over $150,000 - a threshold Democratic critics say will still hide most payments. The administration has said it will balance transparency concerns with protecting what it calls confidential business information.\nThe White House also took heat from lawmakers for issuing guidance they said allows federal agencies to ignore legislative mandates to collect and report details on how aid recipients spend the money to save jobs. The legislation calls for reporting that information to the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee - of which Miller is a member. [nL1N2DV1ZA]\nMiller\u2019s remit focuses immediately on a $500 billion portion of the aid package administered by the Treasury Department, such as airline bailouts and funding for Federal Reserve emergency lending. But the law opens the door for him to oversee other bailouts, including the business loan program.\nSkeptics of Miller mostly cite his most recent job, as a senior associate White House counsel starting in December 2018. While he generally kept a low profile, Miller angered Democrats with a letter denying a Congressional watchdog agency\u2019s information request related to the Ukraine impeachment inquiry.\n\u201cTrump is making appointments based on loyalty,\u201d said Virginia Canter, ethics counsel at the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and a former White House lawyer under two Democratic presidents. \u201cSo you have to ask yourself: Can you commit yourself to representing the public interest when your past job was being the president\u2019s lawyer?\u201d\nRELATED COVERAGE\nU.S. lawmakers move to fight Treasury bid to curtail pandemic watchdog\nDemocratic lawmakers have been more blunt. Trump \u201cput a fox in charge of the henhouse,\u201d said Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal in a statement.\nFROM THEOLOGY TO LAW\nFormer colleagues describe Miller as a serious and unpretentious veteran attorney. Before entering the law, Miller had planned a career in the church. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree from Temple University in Philadelphia, and dual master\u2019s degrees from nearby Westminster Theological Seminary. When he didn\u2019t immediately find a position, he went to law school at the University of Texas, graduating in 1983.\nMiller is active at the small Presbyterian church in the Washington suburbs, where his son is the pastor. His minister at a previous church, Bob Becker, calls Miller humble and grounded, with a \u201cheart of service.\u201d\nAfter a few years in private practice, Miller in 1987 joined the Washington-based U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and in 1990 moved to the Justice Department, where we worked for 15 years. Some of his best-known work came as a prosecutor in the Eastern District of Virginia, a high-profile outpost dubbed the \u201crocket docket\u201d for its fast-moving cases.\nDuring that time, Ed Gibson was a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent investigating money-laundering cases. He remembers Miller pulling him aside when he wanted a more severe punishment for a white-collar conviction. Miller asked Gibson something that sticks with him today: \u201cEd, is that really what you want? Isn\u2019t it justice you are seeking?\u201d\nMiller embraced difficult cases, including the complicated prosecution of a physician accused of overprescribing opioids - known as \u201cDr. Feelgood\u201d - and that of Zacarias Moussaoui, who helped plan the September 11, 2001 attacks.\n\u201cHe was just tremendous,\u201d said Gene Rossi, a fellow prosecutor at the time who credits Miller\u2019s calm diplomacy with saving the opioid case.\nTERRORIZING REPUBLICANS\nFormer colleagues say Miller didn\u2019t hesitate to take on the Republican leadership of the GSA, a sprawling agency coordinating billions in spending.\nDuring nine years there as inspector general, starting in 2005, Miller was an aggressive watchdog - so much so that the agency\u2019s chief, Lurita Doan, once suggested he and his staff were practicing a form of terrorism, according to a Washington Post report at the time.\nDoan froze hiring in Miller\u2019s office and tried to cut its spending. GSA staff filed complaints against Miller, and Congress members called on President George W. Bush to fire him, according to Congressional hearings and reports.\nUndeterred, Miller revealed that Doan had steered a GSA contract to a friend, among other interventions. Congress excoriated Doan, who resigned under pressure in 2008. Doan denied wrongdoing at the time; she did not respond to a request for comment.\n\u201cWhat ultimately came out vindicated Brian,\u201d said Ted Stehney, the former head of audits in Miller\u2019s GSA office.\nMiller later drove an investigation into a lavish GSA staff event near Las Vegas that resulted in the resignation of the agency\u2019s new chief, Martha Johnson, an appointee of President Barack Obama.\nEx-GSA chief Johnson - who was not directly involved in planning the conference and supported Miller\u2019s investigation - called him a diligent auditor but said his passions could be small-minded. While he unearthed the conference spending abuses, Johnson said, \u201cIt was like \u2018really\u2019?\u2019 GSA is in the thick of all-of-government spending - federal, state, local, tribal, war theater - and this is what he was fussing with?\u201d\nMiller is as parsimonious in his personal life as he expects others to be in government. Stehney, the former GSA colleague, said Miller has always wanted a Cadillac but never bought one.\n\u201cHe loved to ride in mine, but he still drove his Honda hybrid,\u201d he said.\n\u2018DUTY TO SERVE\u2019\nSome associates were surprised when Miller departed from his usual nonpartisan practices by taking a White House job.\nMiller told a friend he wanted to get back to public-sector work after a stint in private practice, defending clients from government investigations. Miller told the friend that he \u201cfelt a duty to serve\u201d when approached about the White House job.\nThe few details that have emerged from Miller\u2019s White House work have fueled concerns over his independence.\nDemocrats called Miller\u2019s denial of a Government Accountability Office (GAO) request regarding the impeachment inquiry improper. Miller downplayed the letter in the May Congressional hearing as \u201canswering the mail,\u201d saying he merely referred the matter to the White House Office of Management and Budget, which had previously responded, providing some information but denying other requests.\nHe also received an ethics waiver allowing him to continue working with current GSA head Emily Murphy after taking his White House role. While in private practice, Miller had advised Murphy during a GSA inspector-general probe into the cancellation of a relocation of the FBI\u2019s Washington headquarters. The move could\u2019ve hurt revenue at Trump\u2019s nearby hotel.\nA friend of Miller from Washington legal circles, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he understood the raised eyebrows over Miller\u2019s White House work.\n\u201cIf I didn\u2019t know Brian, I would be suspicious given what Trump has done with the IG community,\u201d the friend said. \u201cBut he\u2019s Brian. He will do his job, and if it means he gets fired for it, he gets fired for it.\u201d\nReporting by Lawrence Delevingne, Chris Prentice and Koh Gui Qing; Additional reporting by Pete Schroeder; Editing by Tom Lasseter and Brian Thevenot\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"url": "/article/idUSKBN23X1T2", "headline": "PM Johnson says Britain must break down barriers for Black people", "published_date": "2020-06-26", "text": "By Reuters Staff\n2 MIN READ\nFILE PHOTO: Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson leaves Downing Street in London, Britain, June 24, 2020.

As America\u2019s inspector general for pandemic relief, he\u2019s charged with rooting out fraud in the spending of trillions of dollars in emergency aid.\nFILE PHOTO: White House lawyer Brian Miller, nominated by U.S. President Donald Trump to be the Treasury Department's Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery, is sworn in during a U.S. Senate Banking Committee confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., May 5, 2020. Alex Wong/Pool via REUTERS\nBut before even starting work, he was blasted by Democratic lawmakers who say he\u2019ll be more of a lapdog than watchdog, citing his recent history as a lawyer in Donald Trump\u2019s White House. And Trump himself - who in recent months has ousted a raft of inspectors general, prosecutors and other officials - signaled that he\u2019ll keep Miller on a tight leash, forbidding him from reporting to Congress without \u201cpresidential supervision.\u201d\nHow Miller, a Trump appointee, handles such pressures will test the administration\u2019s willingness - or lack of it - to demand accountability in pandemic relief spending. Miller\u2019s response also could make or break the reputation the veteran prosecutor and inspector general has built over decades.\nReuters interviewed more than two dozen people who know Miller or have insight into the job confronting him to understand how he might tackle it. Supporters from across the political spectrum expect Miller to investigate aggressively and impartially. They say he has prosecuted high-profile cases and weathered political controversy as an inspector general - including an uproar over an investigation he led that forced the resignation of the Republican chief of the General Services Administration (GSA).\nBut the new post - Special Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery - poses far higher logistical and political hurdles for the 64-year-old attorney, a Presbyterian elder who married his high school sweetheart and lives in a modest ranch house in Fredericksburg, Va.\nMiller declined to comment for this story. He acknowledged that the position will be \u201cvery challenging and demanding\u201d during his Congressional vetting on May 5.\nGordon Heddell, who has served inspector-general stints at the Labor and Defense departments, called Miller\u2019s work \u201coutstanding\u201d in his job at the GSA. Still, Heddell said, any inspector general under Trump has to expect \u201ca day of reckoning.\u201d\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Matthews declined to comment on concerns that Miller\u2019s independence could be compromised by his recent White House work and Trump\u2019s record of firing inspector generals.\nMiller\u2019s appointment, announced in April, places him at the center of a roiling battle over transparency in pandemic spending. The administration initially fought to keep secret the names and loan amounts of recipients in a $660 billion program offering forgivable loans to businesses. The Treasury Department has since agreed to disclose information for awards over $150,000 - a threshold Democratic critics say will still hide most payments. The administration has said it will balance transparency concerns with protecting what it calls confidential business information.\nThe White House also took heat from lawmakers for issuing guidance they said allows federal agencies to ignore legislative mandates to collect and report details on how aid recipients spend the money to save jobs. The legislation calls for reporting that information to the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee - of which Miller is a member. [nL1N2DV1ZA]\nMiller\u2019s remit focuses immediately on a $500 billion portion of the aid package administered by the Treasury Department, such as airline bailouts and funding for Federal Reserve emergency lending. But the law opens the door for him to oversee other bailouts, including the business loan program.\nSkeptics of Miller mostly cite his most recent job, as a senior associate White House counsel starting in December 2018. While he generally kept a low profile, Miller angered Democrats with a letter denying a Congressional watchdog agency\u2019s information request related to the Ukraine impeachment inquiry.\n\u201cTrump is making appointments based on loyalty,\u201d said Virginia Canter, ethics counsel at the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and a former White House lawyer under two Democratic presidents. \u201cSo you have to ask yourself: Can you commit yourself to representing the public interest when your past job was being the president\u2019s lawyer?\u201d\nRELATED COVERAGE\nU.S. lawmakers move to fight Treasury bid to curtail pandemic watchdog\nDemocratic lawmakers have been more blunt. Trump \u201cput a fox in charge of the henhouse,\u201d said Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal in a statement.\nFROM THEOLOGY TO LAW\nFormer colleagues describe Miller as a serious and unpretentious veteran attorney. Before entering the law, Miller had planned a career in the church. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree from Temple University in Philadelphia, and dual master\u2019s degrees from nearby Westminster Theological Seminary. When he didn\u2019t immediately find a position, he went to law school at the University of Texas, graduating in 1983.\nMiller is active at the small Presbyterian church in the Washington suburbs, where his son is the pastor.

That is the largest uptick from one cycle to the next since at least 2006.\nPerhaps more significantly, Fraga said, minority candidates have won or forced runoffs in nearly a third of their contests \u2013 the same percentage as the total number of candidates of color, suggesting they are as likely to win as white candidates.\nThe winners include candidates like Ella Jones, who this month was elected the first Black mayor of Ferguson, Missouri, six years after the police killing of teenager Michael Brown there galvanized the Black Lives Matter movement.\nMeanwhile, pressure is mounting on Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden to select a minority running mate. Biden, a 77-year-old white man, defeated the most diverse slate of candidates in U.S. history to clinch the nomination to face Trump in the Nov. 3 election.\nSome Black activists said Republican President Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 victory accelerated the shift. Adrianne Shropshire, the executive director of BlackPAC, a super PAC focused on Black Democrats, noted the historic victories for women of color in 2018; 43 minority women were sworn into the current House, a record.\n\u201cVoters are saying they want candidates and elected leaders who can address the issue of structural racism,\u201d Shropshire said.\nSENDING A MESSAGE\nIn Virginia on Tuesday, Cameron Webb, a Black doctor, defeated a raft of fellow Democrats to win the nomination in a competitive Republican-leaning House district.\nIn Kentucky, Black state lawmaker Charles Booker, until recently an afterthought in the Democratic primary to select an opponent for Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, mounted an unexpectedly robust challenge to Amy McGrath, the former Marine fighter pilot backed by the party leadership. The race was too close to call with absentee ballots pending.\nMondaire Jones and Ritchie Torres, either of whom would be the first openly gay Black member of Congress, appeared likely to prevail over crowded primary fields in two open House seats in heavily Democratic districts in and around New York City.\nThe 14-term Democratic Representative Carolyn Maloney of New York held a narrow lead over Suraj Patel, a 36-year-old business professor of Indian descent who has questioned whether Maloney, 74, is the right person to address institutional racism.\nThe increased diversity is not limited to Democrats. The number of Republican House candidates who are members of minorities rose from 12.6% in 2018 to 20% in 2020 in the 22 states that held primary elections before this week, said Fraga, the Indiana University professor.\nMany of the contests on Tuesday featured overlapping dynamics beyond race, including generational and ideological clashes.\nBowman and Booker were among those endorsed by liberal stalwarts like Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren over more moderate incumbents, while young candidates like Patel argued their campaigns represented an opportunity for change.\nThe protests have deepened Black voters\u2019 determination to send a message, according to Cliff Albright, the co-founder of the nonprofit group Black Voters Matter Fund.\nHe traveled from his home in Atlanta to Kentucky for Booker\u2019s primary, where he saw dozens of voters, many of them Black, chanting \u201cOpen the doors!\u201d outside a polling place that closed at 6 p.m. in Louisville.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever seen, at a polling place after it closed, people banging on the doors,\u201d he said.\nReporting by Joseph Ax, Editing by Soyoung Kim and Cynthia Osterman\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"url": "/article/idUSL4N2E12AT", "headline": "Unilever, rivals mull changes amid global backlash against skin-lightening products", "published_date": "2020-06-25", "text": "By Rupam Jain, Charlotte Greenfield\n3 MIN READ\nMUMBAI/ISLAMABAD, June 25 (Reuters) - Unilever is considering marketing changes to its dominant line of skin lightening creams, according to a company source in South Asia, even as the company and its rivals face a growing global social media backlash against such products.\nProducts marketed as skin lightening have a huge market in South Asia, due to a societal obsession with fairer skin tones.\nUnilever\u2019s \u2018Fair & Lovely\u2019 brand dominates the market in South Asia, while similar products are sold by L\u2019Or\u00e9al and Procter & Gamble.

It passed the assembly on June 11 with a 56-5 vote.\n\u201cMaybe we\u2019ll be a model for what can happen at the federal level,\u201d Weber told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nThe bill goes next to the California State Senate, where she expects it to pass and then be signed into law by the governor.\nThe idea of reparation is nothing new and has been used around the world to compensate victims of war, rape, terror and a host of other historical injustices.\nYet the United States has never made much headway in its discussions of whether or how to compensate African Americans for more than 200 years of slavery inflicted on their ancestors by white people. In the subsequent decades, racial inequality in wealth, housing, healthcare and education has persisted.\nSome Democrats want a commission to look into reparations, but the bill that would do this - H.R. 40 - has been on the table for decades and never garnered broad support.\nNow that Floyd\u2019s death has shed light on racial inequality, advocates say support for reparations is up. Like Weber, many do not plan to wait on the federal government to make a move.\n\u201cThere are a lot of things happening locally,\u201d said Justin Hansford, a law professor and director of the Thurgood Marshall Civil Rights Center at Howard University.\n\u201cReparations are going to happen locally first, and then later on, there\u2019s likely to be a national response as well.\u201d\nIn partnership with Columbia University, Howard University last week launched a project to identify and support local efforts to provide redress to African Americans - both for slavery and for racially motivated crimes.\nCalled the U.S. African American Redress Network, it details more than 100 efforts to make good, ranging from public apologies to compensation in the form of scholarships or cash.\nLOCAL ACTION\nThere are several cases of reparations being paid to African Americans which advocates say could serve as a blueprint.\nIn the earliest example, the state of Florida in 1994 awarded payment and free college tuition to descendents of the victims of a massacre 71 years earlier, when a white mob burned their town to the ground.\nGeorgetown University and Virginia Theological Seminary are among schools pledging to offer funds for descendants of the slaves that built them or were sold to finance them.\nAnd last year the city of Evanston, in Illinois, created a reparations fund to bridge the racial wealth gap among its residents, funded by taxes on marijuana.\nThere are many different ways to pay reparations, but what matters is the intent, said Weber, the assemblywoman.\n\u201cThat\u2019s normally what people do who believe that others have been wronged. You try to figure out how you can level the playing field,\u201d she said.\nEven private industries donating to racial justice funds can be seen as a form of reparations, said Hansford.\n\u201cTo me that is acknowledgement that there needs to be an investment in order to get healing,\u201d he said.\nBig companies from Bank of America to PepsiCo have pledged millions on addressing racial inequality since Floyd\u2019s death.\nIn Britain, insurer Lloyd\u2019s of London and the pub chain Greene King have apologized for their role in the slave trade and also said they will invest in Black communities and talent.\nPOLITICAL ROADBLOCK\nThe issue gained national attention last year when several Democratic primary candidates endorsed reparations. Presidential nominee Joe Biden has said he supports a study.\nThe national bill has more backing than ever, but not among Republicans, whose vote it would need to pass the Senate.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says reparations are a bad idea because \u201cnone of us currently living are responsible\u201d for slavery.\nLawmakers in at least five states have introduced their own legislation to explore the issue.\n\u201cSome of the political actors do believe that they have a better chance of passing these bills in the midst of the current wave of protests,\u201d said William Darity, a professor at Duke University who co-authored a book on reparations.\nSmall-scale initiatives are admirable, but anything less than a national effort will be insufficient to close the racial wealth gap, said Darity.\nThe average Black household has a net wealth $800,000 lower than the average white household, he estimates.\n\u201cThe states and the localities, they just don\u2019t have the capacity to meet that task,\u201d said Darity, who suggests giving each of the roughly 40 million Black Americans descended from slaves up to $250,000 in a trust.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the federal government that should be the culpable party because [it] created the legal and the authority framework that permitted all of these atrocities to take place,\u201d he added.\nGlobally, there are precedents.\nGermany paid millions to Holocaust survivors and South Africa compensated apartheid victims. Family members of disappeared Colombians, rape survivors, and those displaced in the country\u2019s armed conflict have been compensated since 2011.\nIn response to protests over racial inequality, the top United Nations official for human rights called on countries to make amends for racist violence through reparations.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no amount of money that can be paid, really, to fully repair,\u201d said Arif Ali, a lawyer who was part of a U.N. team on compensation for victims of Iraq\u2019s 1990 invasion of Kuwait.\nAli said that under international law, the United States was obliged to pay - it is now just a matter of working out how.\n\u201cThe experience of other countries is a reference point,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a way.\u201d\nReporting by Nellie Peyton and Christine Murray; editing by Lyndsay Griffiths.

It could delay a restructuring that perhaps should be happening earlier,\u201d said Jane Gray, head of European research at Covenant Review.\nEbitda is a key measure of performance and business valuation. Loosening documentation over the past few years has gifted borrowers a great level of flexibility to adjust their earnings via numerous exclusions and add-backs. It has become common practice to estimate generous cost savings and synergies on buyouts to lower leverage and make deals acceptable to regulators and investors.\nHowever, a growing number of lawyers and investors argue that adding back coronavirus-related costs is controversial and not appropriate due to the unprecedented nature of the crisis.\n\u201cThe language in documentation allows such flexibility and borrowers are interpreting it in a way that is favourable for them. But is it a correct interpretation? It is controversial,\u201d a leveraged loan lawyer said.\nFAIRY TALE\nGerman beauty retailer Douglas, which has 2,400 stores across Europe, is one such company to make coronavirus adjustments.\nLast month, the leveraged loan borrower added \u20ac15m back to earnings for its second quarter results ended 31 March, to take account of what it termed, \u201cstaff and rent related idle costs in connection with our closed stores.\u201d\nDouglas\u2019 reported Ebitda was a \u20ac1m loss in the second quarter, compared with adjusted Ebitdac of a \u20ac23m profit.\nThe \u20ac15m add-back also pushed leverage down by around 0.3 times, according to fintech data provider 9fin.\nChanging the numbers to take account of coronavirus is seen as controversial as no one knows how long the pandemic it will last and how it will play out.\n\u201cWhen it comes to coronavirus, it\u2019s a different scenario. Companies are estimating based on a hypothetical situation, and no one knows how it will turn out,\u201d said Sabrina Fox, executive adviser at European Leveraged Finance Association (ELFA).\n\u201cEbitdac is just a fairy tale and using it in covenant calculations would be like living in a world of imagination.\u201d\nIn addition, the ELFA -- whose members include Allianz Global Investors and Janus Henderson Investors -- urged loan borrowers and high-yield issuers not to use Ebitdac as a calculation metric to incur additional debt.\n\u201cWe discourage companies from stripping off the effects of the pandemic only to wind up with more leverage,\u201d said Fox.\n\u201cIt is by no means guaranteed that Ebitdac reflects forward-looking operating trends, and as such it should not be relied on as a calculation metric for any purpose under debt documents.\u201d\nGETTING CREATIVE\nApart from earnings adjustments, some borrowers have taken another approach to covenant calculations by using 2019 historical figures, instead of 2020 figures in a bid to avoid breaches.\nUS ticket and concert company Live Nation made amendments in April with existing lenders that allowed the firm to use 2019 earnings to calculate the consolidated net leverage ratio covenant for the fourth quarter of 2020 through to the second quarter of 2021, according to the firm\u2019s result announcement.\nUS luggage maker Samsonite also amended loan terms so that it could use 2019 Ebitda figures in covenant calculations from the end of September 2021 until end of March 2022.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really the same thing,\u201d said Gray at Covenant Review. \u201cUsing last year\u2019s figures is simply a way of justifying the quantification of the adjustment they are making.

It could delay a restructuring that perhaps should be happening earlier,\u201d said Jane Gray, head of European research at Covenant Review.\nEbitda is a key measure of performance and business valuation. Loosening documentation over the past few years has gifted borrowers a great level of flexibility to adjust their earnings via numerous exclusions and add-backs. It has become common practice to estimate generous cost savings and synergies on buyouts to lower leverage and make deals acceptable to regulators and investors.\nHowever, a growing number of lawyers and investors argue that adding back coronavirus-related costs is controversial and not appropriate due to the unprecedented nature of the crisis.\n\u201cThe language in documentation allows such flexibility and borrowers are interpreting it in a way that is favourable for them. But is it a correct interpretation? It is controversial,\u201d a leveraged loan lawyer said.\nFAIRY TALE\nGerman beauty retailer Douglas, which has 2,400 stores across Europe, is one such company to make coronavirus adjustments.\nLast month, the leveraged loan borrower added \u20ac15m back to earnings for its second quarter results ended 31 March, to take account of what it termed, \u201cstaff and rent related idle costs in connection with our closed stores.\u201d\nDouglas\u2019 reported Ebitda was a \u20ac1m loss in the second quarter, compared with adjusted Ebitdac of a \u20ac23m profit.\nThe \u20ac15m add-back also pushed leverage down by around 0.3 times, according to fintech data provider 9fin.\nChanging the numbers to take account of coronavirus is seen as controversial as no one knows how long the pandemic it will last and how it will play out.\n\u201cWhen it comes to coronavirus, it\u2019s a different scenario. Companies are estimating based on a hypothetical situation, and no one knows how it will turn out,\u201d said Sabrina Fox, executive adviser at European Leveraged Finance Association (ELFA).\n\u201cEbitdac is just a fairy tale and using it in covenant calculations would be like living in a world of imagination.\u201d\nIn addition, the ELFA -- whose members include Allianz Global Investors and Janus Henderson Investors -- urged loan borrowers and high-yield issuers not to use Ebitdac as a calculation metric to incur additional debt.\n\u201cWe discourage companies from stripping off the effects of the pandemic only to wind up with more leverage,\u201d said Fox.\n\u201cIt is by no means guaranteed that Ebitdac reflects forward-looking operating trends, and as such it should not be relied on as a calculation metric for any purpose under debt documents.\u201d\nGETTING CREATIVE\nApart from earnings adjustments, some borrowers have taken another approach to covenant calculations by using 2019 historical figures, instead of 2020 figures in a bid to avoid breaches.\nUS ticket and concert company Live Nation made amendments in April with existing lenders that allowed the firm to use 2019 earnings to calculate the consolidated net leverage ratio covenant for the fourth quarter of 2020 through to the second quarter of 2021, according to the firm\u2019s result announcement.\nUS luggage maker Samsonite also amended loan terms so that it could use 2019 Ebitda figures in covenant calculations from the end of September 2021 until end of March 2022.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really the same thing,\u201d said Gray at Covenant Review. \u201cUsing last year\u2019s figures is simply a way of justifying the quantification of the adjustment they are making. They are seeking to \u2018normalise\u2019 Ebitda as if Covid had not happened.\u201d\nThe key reason for existing lenders or institutional investors to support those amendments is to limit the amount of defaulted loans in their portfolio, taking a view that the pandemic will be a short-term matter, bankers and investors said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sticking plaster solution,\u201d a loan banker said.\nHowever, no-one knows how long such flexibility could last and when lenders\u2019 patience will dry up.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone has a clue on any of it.

The calls for their removal, along with massive Black Lives Matter protests earlier this month and local governments reforming police forces, were sparked by the May 25 death of George Floyd, a Black man killed in police custody.\nTrump has been out of step with most of the country, blasting the protests even though a majority of Americans sympathize with them.

Canadian imports split U.S. aluminium sector: Andy Home", "published_date": "2020-06-21", "text": "By Andy Home\n7 MIN READ\n(Repeats June 19 story with no changes to text)\n* The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.\n* US Midwest Aluminium Premium: tmsnrt.rs/3fGM2OC\n* US Imports of Canadian Aluminium: tmsnrt.rs/2YTWhbE\nLONDON, June 19 (Reuters) - A surge in Canadian aluminium imports \u201cis destroying what remains of the United States industry\u201d.\nThe dramatic warning comes from the American Primary Aluminum Association (APAA), which represents Century Aluminum and Magnitude 7 Metals, two of the last three remaining primary producers in the United States.\nThe solution, they argue in a May 27 letter to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, is to revoke Canada\u2019s exemption from import tariffs.\nThe U.S. Aluminum Association (AA), which has a much larger membership including the country\u2019s third producer Alcoa, vehemently disagrees.\n\u201cThe Great Canadian Aluminum Distraction\u201d has diverted attention from the sector\u2019s more pressing issues with Chinese overcapacity and exports, it claims.\nThis uncivil war of words has fueled a sharp turnaround in the Midwest aluminium premium as the regional market reassesses the prospect of renewed tariffs on the largest-volume supplier to the U.S. market.\nIt also lays bare the failure of President Donald Trump\u2019s 10% tariffs to revitalise domestic production of a metal the administration deems critical to national security.\nBut is Canada to blame? Or is it the solution?\nBATTLE OF THE SURGE\nThe APAA claims that Canadian imports of primary aluminium have surged since the country was exempted from tariffs in May 2019.\nThe word has lobbying resonance.\nThe trade agreement between the two countries includes a provision that tariffs on Canadian aluminium can be re-imposed if imports \u201csurge meaningfully beyond historic volumes of trade over a period of time, with consideration of market share\u201d.\nUnfortunately, the trade negotiators didn\u2019t specify what would represent a \u201cmeaningful\u201d surge or what time period would be used as reference point.\nA diplomatic oversight that now forms a statistical battleground between the APAA and the AA.\nIt is true that more Canadian aluminium has been entering the United States this year.\nImports of primary metal jumped by 46% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2020, according to research house CRU.\nBut there are some important caveats.\nFirstly, Canadian production has been rising thanks to the return of the Becancour smelter after a bitter two-year strike that ended in July 2019. The plant produced 72,000 tonnes in January-March, compared with just 77,000 tonnes over the whole of 2019.\nSecondly, there is the not so little matter of COVID-19 and the demand destruction caused by the lockdown of North America\u2019s automotive and construction sectors.\nThere is a lot of surplus aluminium around at the moment. London Metal Exchange (LME) warehouse stocks have risen from under a million tonnes in the middle of March to 1.6 million.\nMuch of that surplus, moreover, is in the form of commodity-grade metal. In response to collapsing automotive demand aluminium producers have shifted their mix away from value-added products to so-called \u201cP1020\u201d aluminium that can be delivered to LME warehouses.\nIt\u2019s precisely that form of metal that the APAA claims has been surging across the border.\nImports of Canadian alloyed metal, on the other hand, are on course to fall 5% this year as the product mix changes, CRU estimates.\nDisentangling such market dynamics from tariff dynamics is highly problematic.\nAnd without an agreed statistical anchor point, one side\u2019s surge is another\u2019s mean reversion.\nThe first quarter imports were actually only 3% higher than the first-quarter average in 2015-2017, notes CRU.\nCanada\u2019s share of the import mix in the quarter was 67%, exactly the same as the 30-year average, according to the AA.\nFRIEND OR FOE?\nThere is one underlying truth in this statistical maze.\nAny post-tariff lift to U.S. aluminium production has run its course with all three operators under financial stress at current prices.\nAlcoa is shutting its Ferndale smelter in the state of Washington, reducing the number of operating plants to just six.\nFerndale is an old plant, first commissioned in 1966. Production lines have been curtailed and reactivated during past aluminium price cycles.\nIndeed, all the remaining U.S. smelters are old, leaving them in the cost-curve danger zone whenever the price falls.\nCentury\u2019s Hawesville, Sebree and Mt Holley smelters date from 1969, 1973 and 1980 respectively.\nThe New Madrid smelter bought out of bankruptcy by Magnitude 7 metals was built in 1971. Its reactivation was hailed by the Trump administration as a tariffs success story but local residents are now living with the dirtiest air in the country.\nTariffs can at best only partially shield such operators from global price trends, even while penalising downstream U.S. aluminium users.\nThat\u2019s a problem for the United States given the determination to build secure supply chains for critical metals such as aluminium.\nParticularly since the world\u2019s largest exporter of primary metal is Russia and the largest exporter of semi-manufactured products is China, two highly problematic trade partners.\nIf the United States is serious about its long-term aluminium supply, it will need to either form an alliance with a friendly producer country or directly subsidise new capacity.\nThe latter may seem an outlandish idea but the Department of Defense has already been authorised to invest directly into other vulnerable critical mineral supply chains such as rare earths.\nIn either case Canada is the obvious aluminium choice.\nIts smelters are newer, lower-cost and greener thanks to Quebec\u2019s hydro-power systems. It may have room for at least another one. It\u2019s far from clear if the more fractured U.S. energy market can accommodate a new power-hungry aluminium smelter.\nCanada\u2019s aluminium sector has also historically been considered an integral part of the United States\u2019 defence sector, a fact easily forgotten in the fractious trade relationship of the last two years.\nRe-imposing tariffs on Canadian aluminium may have short-term political appeal ahead of U.S. elections later this year but the problem of the United States\u2019 ageing smelters isn\u2019t going to go away.\nTariffs would actively work against the obvious long-term solution to the United States\u2019 problem with primary aluminium.\nIt\u2019s ironic that Canadian imports are roiling the aluminium sector even as the two countries work towards a broader metallic alliance.\nThe U.S.-Canada Critical Minerals Working Group held its second virtual meeting on June 17 with both sides reaffirming their \u201ccommitment to further strengthen the U.S.-Canada supply chain for critical minerals that are essential to our mutual security and future prosperity\u201d.\nWe don\u2019t know if aluminium was on the agenda.

(Reuters) - President Donald Trump, addressing a less-than-full arena for his first political rally in months, blasted anti-racism protests and defended his handling of the coronavirus on Saturday in a bid to reinvigorate his re-election campaign.\n The president, who revels in large crowds and had predicted that his first rally in months would be epic, blamed the media for discouraging attendees and cited bad behavior by demonstrators outside, but did not specifically acknowledge that many seats in the 19,000-seat BOK Center arena were empty.\nTrump sought to use the event to bring momentum back to his campaign after coming under fire for his responses to the coronavirus and to the death of George Floyd, a Black man who died in the custody of Minneapolis police.\nThe smaller-than-expected crowd robbed him, at least for now, of the ability to highlight enthusiasm for his candidacy as an advantage over his expected Democratic challenger, former Vice President Joe Biden, who has eschewed large campaign events.\nTrump has brushed aside criticism for his decision to hold his first rally since March 2 in Tulsa, the site of the country\u2019s bloodiest outbreaks of racist violence against Black Americans some 100 years ago.\nThe president, who has encouraged a militaristic response to the nationwide demonstrations while being accused of showing a lack of empathy for the plight of Black Americans, used his speech to take aim at some of the protesters.\n\u201cThe unhinged left-wing mob is trying to vandalize our history, desecrate our monuments - our beautiful monuments - tear down our statues and punish, cancel and persecute anyone who does not conform to their demands for absolute and total control. We\u2019re not conforming,\u201d Trump told cheering supporters.\nAhead of the Nov. 3 election the Republican president is trailing in opinion polls to Biden, who has hammered Trump for his response to the protests and the pandemic.\nTrump defended his response to COVID-19, saying more testing had led to identifying more cases, seemingly to his chagrin.\nSlideshow ( 25 images )\n\u201cWhen you do testing to that extent, you\u2019re going to ... find more cases,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, I said to my people, \u2018Slow the testing down, please.\u2019\u201d A White House official said he was \u201cobviously kidding\u201d with that remark.\nHours before the rally, Trump\u2019s campaign announced six members of its advance team had tested positive for COVID-19.

Canadian imports split U.S. aluminium sector: Andy Home", "published_date": "2020-06-19", "text": "By Andy Home\n7 MIN READ\n(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)\n* US Midwest Aluminium Premium: tmsnrt.rs/3fGM2OC\n* US Imports of Canadian Aluminium: tmsnrt.rs/2YTWhbE\nLONDON, June 19 (Reuters) - A surge in Canadian aluminium imports \u201cis destroying what remains of the United States industry\u201d.\nThe dramatic warning comes from the American Primary Aluminum Association (APAA), which represents Century Aluminum and Magnitude 7 Metals, two of the last three remaining primary producers in the United States.\nThe solution, they argue in a May 27 letter to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, is to revoke Canada\u2019s exemption from import tariffs.\nThe U.S. Aluminum Association (AA), which has a much larger membership including the country\u2019s third producer Alcoa, vehemently disagrees.\n\u201cThe Great Canadian Aluminum Distraction\u201d has diverted attention from the sector\u2019s more pressing issues with Chinese overcapacity and exports, it claims.\nThis uncivil war of words has fueled a sharp turnaround in the Midwest aluminium premium as the regional market reassesses the prospect of renewed tariffs on the largest-volume supplier to the U.S. market.\nIt also lays bare the failure of President Donald Trump\u2019s 10% tariffs to revitalise domestic production of a metal the administration deems critical to national security.\nBut is Canada to blame? Or is it the solution?\nBATTLE OF THE SURGE\nThe APAA claims that Canadian imports of primary aluminium have surged since the country was exempted from tariffs in May 2019.\nThe word has lobbying resonance.\nThe trade agreement between the two countries includes a provision that tariffs on Canadian aluminium can be re-imposed if imports \u201csurge meaningfully beyond historic volumes of trade over a period of time, with consideration of market share\u201d.\nUnfortunately, the trade negotiators didn\u2019t specify what would represent a \u201cmeaningful\u201d surge or what time period would be used as reference point.\nA diplomatic oversight that now forms a statistical battleground between the APAA and the AA.\nIt is true that more Canadian aluminium has been entering the United States this year.\nImports of primary metal jumped by 46% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2020, according to research house CRU.\nBut there are some important caveats.\nFirstly, Canadian production has been rising thanks to the return of the Becancour smelter after a bitter two-year strike that ended in July 2019. The plant produced 72,000 tonnes in January-March, compared with just 77,000 tonnes over the whole of 2019.\nSecondly, there is the not so little matter of COVID-19 and the demand destruction caused by the lockdown of North America\u2019s automotive and construction sectors.\nThere is a lot of surplus aluminium around at the moment. London Metal Exchange (LME) warehouse stocks have risen from under a million tonnes in the middle of March to 1.6 million.\nMuch of that surplus, moreover, is in the form of commodity-grade metal. In response to collapsing automotive demand aluminium producers have shifted their mix away from value-added products to so-called \u201cP1020\u201d aluminium that can be delivered to LME warehouses.\nIt\u2019s precisely that form of metal that the APAA claims has been surging across the border.\nImports of Canadian alloyed metal, on the other hand, are on course to fall 5% this year as the product mix changes, CRU estimates.\nDisentangling such market dynamics from tariff dynamics is highly problematic.\nAnd without an agreed statistical anchor point, one side\u2019s surge is another\u2019s mean reversion.\nThe first quarter imports were actually only 3% higher than the first-quarter average in 2015-2017, notes CRU.\nCanada\u2019s share of the import mix in the quarter was 67%, exactly the same as the 30-year average, according to the AA.\nFRIEND OR FOE?\nThere is one underlying truth in this statistical maze.\nAny post-tariff lift to U.S. aluminium production has run its course with all three operators under financial stress at current prices.\nAlcoa is shutting its Ferndale smelter in the state of Washington, reducing the number of operating plants to just six.\nFerndale is an old plant, first commissioned in 1966. Production lines have been curtailed and reactivated during past aluminium price cycles.\nIndeed, all the remaining U.S. smelters are old, leaving them in the cost-curve danger zone whenever the price falls.\nCentury\u2019s Hawesville, Sebree and Mt Holley smelters date from 1969, 1973 and 1980 respectively.\nThe New Madrid smelter bought out of bankruptcy by Magnitude 7 metals was built in 1971. Its reactivation was hailed by the Trump administration as a tariffs success story but local residents are now living with the dirtiest air in the country.\nTariffs can at best only partially shield such operators from global price trends, even while penalising downstream U.S. aluminium users.\nThat\u2019s a problem for the United States given the determination to build secure supply chains for critical metals such as aluminium.\nParticularly since the world\u2019s largest exporter of primary metal is Russia and the largest exporter of semi-manufactured products is China, two highly problematic trade partners.\nIf the United States is serious about its long-term aluminium supply, it will need to either form an alliance with a friendly producer country or directly subsidise new capacity.\nThe latter may seem an outlandish idea but the Department of Defense has already been authorised to invest directly into other vulnerable critical mineral supply chains such as rare earths.\nIn either case Canada is the obvious aluminium choice.\nIts smelters are newer, lower-cost and greener thanks to Quebec\u2019s hydro-power systems. It may have room for at least another one. It\u2019s far from clear if the more fractured U.S. energy market can accommodate a new power-hungry aluminium smelter.\nCanada\u2019s aluminium sector has also historically been considered an integral part of the United States\u2019 defence sector, a fact easily forgotten in the fractious trade relationship of the last two years.\nRe-imposing tariffs on Canadian aluminium may have short-term political appeal ahead of U.S. elections later this year but the problem of the United States\u2019 ageing smelters isn\u2019t going to go away.\nTariffs would actively work against the obvious long-term solution to the United States\u2019 problem with primary aluminium.\nIt\u2019s ironic that Canadian imports are roiling the aluminium sector even as the two countries work towards a broader metallic alliance.\nThe U.S.-Canada Critical Minerals Working Group held its second virtual meeting on June 17 with both sides reaffirming their \u201ccommitment to further strengthen the U.S.-Canada supply chain for critical minerals that are essential to our mutual security and future prosperity\u201d.\nWe don\u2019t know if aluminium was on the agenda.

That, as athletes, we solve the real issues by using our platforms to speak?\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need to say more. We need to find a way to achieve more. Protesting during an anthem, wearing T-shirts is great, but we need to see real actions being put into the works.\u201d\nBradley also addressed the issue regarding whether players sitting or playing better helps the coalition\u2019s cause.\n\u201cI agree (the) Orlando (restart) will give the players checks to contribute back into their communities,\u201d Bradley told ESPN. \u201cBut how much of that bubble check are players actually able to contribute? Why (is) all of the responsibility being put on the players?\u201d\nThat was part of the reasoning behind the insistence that \u201call those who have more financial power than (players), but aren\u2019t taking a bigger stance when our community needs you\u201d provide more economic assistance to the black community, Bradley said.\nThe NBA has been on hiatus since March 11 due to the coronavirus pandemic.

The social unrest in the country was -- in the same way we never could have predicted the pandemic would unfold, in the way it has -- what\u2019s happened since George Floyd\u2019s death is also unprecedented.\n\u201cI\u2019m incredibly sympathetic and empathetic to what\u2019s happening in people\u2019s lives. And in the midst of all that, to say, \u2018We\u2019re looking for an opportunity to restart this league, to try to move forward with crowning a champion,\u2019 it\u2019s not top of mind for a lot of people.\u201d\nNational Basketball Players Association executive director Michele Roberts said there is no threat to the return of the NBA, on hiatus since March 11 due to the coronavirus pandemic.\nHall of Famer turned broadcaster Charles Barkley said Monday it would be a \u201ccatastrophic mistake\u201d for players to sit out the rest of the season.\n\u201cI think it\u2019d be stupid to not play for two reasons,\u201d Barkley said during an ESPN interview. \u201cNo. 1, if they don\u2019t play, they\u2019ll be out of sight, out of mind for the rest of the year. There won\u2019t be no cameras following. LeBron (James) is probably the most famous athlete in the United States. He won\u2019t be visible anywhere, so out of sight, out of mind.\n\u201cAlso, these guys got to realize this money is going to come back, and they\u2019re going to lose billions of dollars that the players could use to go into their own communities and do some great stuff. So it\u2019s not good on any front. I have no idea what Kyrie and Dwight are talking about. But it would be a catastrophic mistake not to play.\u201d\nIrving, who is not physically cleared to play when the season continues due to a right shoulder injury, was among the players calling for more attention to be paid to social issues and asking for stronger pledges to impact lives off the court.

It did not respond to a request for comment from the company\u2019s founder Mykola Zlochevsky, a former ecology minister now living abroad.\n\u201cLet\u2019s put an end to this once and for all. Biden Jr. and Biden Sr. do not appear in this particular proceeding,\u201d Nazar Kholodnytsky, head of anti-corruption investigations at the prosecution service, told Saturday\u2019s briefing.\nThe bribe related to a case of embezzling state money given to a bank, officials said. Some $5 million was offered to anti-corruption officials and a further $1 million was intended for an official acting as a middleman, Sytnyk said.\nThe suspects were in a hurry to pay the bribe because they wanted to end the case against Zlochevsky in time for his birthday on Sunday, \u201cto close the criminal proceedings and ensure the return of Mr. Zlochevsky to Ukraine,\u201d he said.\nThe country\u2019s former prosecutor general told Reuters in June that an audit he commissioned while in office of thousands of old case files had found no evidence of wrongdoing by Hunter Biden while he worked for Burisma.\nHunter Biden joined Burisma in 2014, one of several high-profile names to join what the private company said was an attempt to strengthen corporate governance.\nHis role has been attacked as corrupt without evidence by Trump and congressional Republicans in Washington. The Bidens deny any wrongdoing and Democrats said Trump was trying to help his re-election prospects.\nWriting by Matthias Williams; Editing by Andrew Cawthorne\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"url": "/article/idUSKBN23K0DC", "headline": "Thousands attend Black <b>Lives</b> <b>Matter</b> protests across Australia", "published_date": "2020-06-13", "text": "By Reuters Staff\n3 MIN READ\nSYDNEY (Reuters) - Thousands of people across Australia attended Black Lives Matter protests on Saturday wearing masks and practising social distancing amid warnings from state leaders to call off the events on fears of a second wave of coronavirus infections.\nThe rallies, dominated by a heavy police presence, were mostly peaceful.

Hiding from Myanmar\u2019s police, journalist Aung Marm Oo refuses to conceal his anger with the civilian government led by Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi as his country prepares for an election later this year.\nFILE PHOTO: Photographs of Myanmar State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi hung in a shop in Yangon, Myanmar, January 23, 2020. REUTERS/Ann Wang\n\u201cDemocracy is already dead,\u201d the 37-year-old editor-in-chief of Development Media Group (DMG) told Reuters from a location he asked to keep secret.\n\u201cThey blocked media, restrict media agencies, banned news, punish journalists. Media is the lifeblood of democracy in the country. Without media, how can democracy survive?\u201d\nWhen Suu Kyi was released from house arrest by a military junta in 2010, Aung Marm Oo was a student activist living in exile. Her release helped persuade him to return home and enter journalism.\nThe 2016 election that brought Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy (NLD) to power ended half a century of military rule. But the generals retain strong influence under a constitution that reserves sweeping powers for the military, and 25% of seats in parliament for its appointees.\nAung Hla Tun, deputy minister for information, said the government had revoked some oppressive laws and was drafting both a right to information law and a hate speech law.\nExpectations of the first democratic government were \u201cvery high and very unrealistic\u201d given \u201caccumulated bad legacies and challenges our predecessors had left us\u201d, he said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not capable of changing all these things drastically in three or four years,\u201d he said in an email, adding that there was a need to promote trust and cooperation between the media and the pillars of power.\nThe interior ministry is controlled by the Tatmadaw, the official name of the armed forces, and the freedom of civil society and the media remains restricted in a country plagued by ethnic conflicts.\nSuu Kyi\u2019s government has stressed the importance of media freedom for building democracy. Before she came to power, Suu Kyi spoke of the need for the law to protect reporters.\nBut her administration has brought charges against 31 journalists ranging from unlawful association to terrorism to criminal defamation since she came to power, according to local rights group Athan, and in recent months the civilian-led information ministry has blocked dozens of news websites, including DMG, accusing them of distributing \u201cfake news\u201d and \u201cfearmongering\u201d.\nNO BYLINES\nMany are reporting on regions inside Myanmar including Rakhine and Shan states that are beset by insurgencies. Aung Marm Oo is wanted on \u201cunlawful association\u201d charges after interviewing militants in his native Rakhine. If caught he faces a maximum three-year prison sentence.\nOne of the most sensitive regions, Rakhine is where a military crackdown in 2017 prompted more than 730,000 Rohingya Muslims to flee the country. Now, a new conflict has erupted there - this time between government forces and Arakan Army (AA) insurgents recruited from the mostly Buddhist ethnic Rakhine majority.\nFour independent journalists who survived years working under the constraints imposed by the junta told Reuters they had hoped pen names, safe houses and smuggled footage would no longer be needed to report, but for some they have once again become the safest way to operate.\nTo keep their reports flowing, DMG reporters upload stories directly to Facebook, and rely on a network of citizen journalists to smuggle photos out of conflict zones, according to Aung Marm Oo.\nMonywa Aung Shin, a senior NLD member and editor of the ruling party\u2019s journal, disagreed that media freedom had declined but said it was correct to say that \u201climitations\u201d on reporting existed.\nHe acknowledged a need to \u201ccorrect people\u2019s perspectives\u201d towards journalists and said authorities should analyse the intent of journalists contacting a militant group before taking action against them.\nThe safest place for journalists to write impartially, without fear, is in exile, said Lawi Weng, a reporter for online website Irrawaddy News, who moved back to Myanmar in 2013 after a decade in Thailand.\n\u201cThere is a conflict ... happening in front of our eyes. But we cannot really report on it,\u201d he said.\nDANGEROUS WORK\nBefore the junta began reforms, Myanmar lay at the very bottom of the World Press Freedom Index. Between 2010 and 2016, it climbed 20 places, but has slid back since and this year stood at 139 out of 180.\n\u201cIn my opinion, the sense of freedom the reporters feel on the ground matters more than the ranking decided by others,\u201d said Aung Hla Tun, the deputy information minister, adding that Myanmar was higher than its neighbours, Thailand and Bangladesh.\nThe arrest in 2017 of two Reuters journalists while they were investigating a massacre of Rohingya Muslims was the highest-profile case involving media freedom. They were found guilty of breaching the Official Secrets Act and sentenced to seven years in prison.\nThe pair were freed after 500 days on a presidential pardon.\nAthan says at least four journalists are facing charges in connection with coverage of the conflict in Rakhine.\nAfter his news website published an interview with an Arakan Army spokesman, journalist Nay Myo Lin, who returned from exile to found the Voice of Myanmar (VOM), was arrested and charged in March under the counter-terrorism act, which can carry result in a life sentence.\nHe was released after 10 days but is still dealing with the consequences.\n\u201cEven my wife, a journalist, thinks I should stop,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous, and we\u2019ve lost our savings.

Media is the lifeblood of democracy in the country. Without media, how can democracy survive?\u201d\nWhen Suu Kyi was released from house arrest by a military junta in 2010, Aung Marm Oo was a student activist living in exile. Her release helped persuade him to return home and enter journalism.\nThe 2016 election that brought Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy (NLD) to power ended half a century of military rule. But the generals retain strong influence under a constitution that reserves sweeping powers for the military, and 25% of seats in parliament for its appointees.\nAung Hla Tun, deputy minister for information, said the government had revoked some oppressive laws and was drafting both a right to information law and a hate speech law.\nExpectations of the first democratic government were \u201cvery high and very unrealistic\u201d given \u201caccumulated bad legacies and challenges our predecessors had left us\u201d, he said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not capable of changing all these things drastically in three or four years,\u201d he said in an email, adding that there was a need to promote trust and cooperation between the media and the pillars of power.\nThe interior ministry is controlled by the Tatmadaw, the official name of the armed forces, and the freedom of civil society and the media remains restricted in a country plagued by ethnic conflicts.\nSuu Kyi\u2019s government has stressed the importance of media freedom for building democracy. Before she came to power, Suu Kyi spoke of the need for the law to protect reporters.\nBut her administration has brought charges against 31 journalists ranging from unlawful association to terrorism to criminal defamation since she came to power, according to local rights group Athan, and in recent months the civilian-led information ministry has blocked dozens of news websites, including DMG, accusing them of distributing \u201cfake news\u201d and \u201cfearmongering\u201d.\nNO BYLINES\nMany are reporting on regions inside Myanmar including Rakhine and Shan states that are beset by insurgencies. Aung Marm Oo is wanted on \u201cunlawful association\u201d charges after interviewing militants in his native Rakhine. If caught he faces a maximum three-year prison sentence.\nOne of the most sensitive regions, Rakhine is where a military crackdown in 2017 prompted more than 730,000 Rohingya Muslims to flee the country. Now, a new conflict has erupted there - this time between government forces and Arakan Army (AA) insurgents recruited from the mostly Buddhist ethnic Rakhine majority.\nFour independent journalists who survived years working under the constraints imposed by the junta told Reuters they had hoped pen names, safe houses and smuggled footage would no longer be needed to report, but for some they have once again become the safest way to operate.\nTo keep their reports flowing, DMG reporters upload stories directly to Facebook, and rely on a network of citizen journalists to smuggle photos out of conflict zones, according to Aung Marm Oo.\nMonywa Aung Shin, a senior NLD member and editor of the ruling party\u2019s journal, disagreed that media freedom had declined but said it was correct to say that \u201climitations\u201d on reporting existed.\nHe acknowledged a need to \u201ccorrect people\u2019s perspectives\u201d towards journalists and said authorities should analyse the intent of journalists contacting a militant group before taking action against them.\nThe safest place for journalists to write impartially, without fear, is in exile, said Lawi Weng, a reporter for online website Irrawaddy News, who moved back to Myanmar in 2013 after a decade in Thailand.\n\u201cThere is a conflict ... happening in front of our eyes. But we cannot really report on it,\u201d he said.\nDANGEROUS WORK\nBefore the junta began reforms, Myanmar lay at the very bottom of the World Press Freedom Index. Between 2010 and 2016, it climbed 20 places, but has slid back since and this year stood at 139 out of 180.\n\u201cIn my opinion, the sense of freedom the reporters feel on the ground matters more than the ranking decided by others,\u201d said Aung Hla Tun, the deputy information minister, adding that Myanmar was higher than its neighbours, Thailand and Bangladesh.\nThe arrest in 2017 of two Reuters journalists while they were investigating a massacre of Rohingya Muslims was the highest-profile case involving media freedom. They were found guilty of breaching the Official Secrets Act and sentenced to seven years in prison.\nThe pair were freed after 500 days on a presidential pardon.\nAthan says at least four journalists are facing charges in connection with coverage of the conflict in Rakhine.\nAfter his news website published an interview with an Arakan Army spokesman, journalist Nay Myo Lin, who returned from exile to found the Voice of Myanmar (VOM), was arrested and charged in March under the counter-terrorism act, which can carry result in a life sentence.\nHe was released after 10 days but is still dealing with the consequences.\n\u201cEven my wife, a journalist, thinks I should stop,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous, and we\u2019ve lost our savings.

North Dakota typically sells about two-thirds of its soybean crop to China, but those sales have been curtailed since 2018 due to the trade war.\nNorth Dakota\u2019s farmers are cutting spending and hoarding grain instead of selling at loss-making prices, with spring stockpiles of corn and soybeans reaching the second highest on record for the state.\nPaul Sproule, a farmer in Grand Forks, would normally trade in tractors and combine harvesters every two to three years for new ones.

C.J. Cron is expected to man first base for Detroit this season after arriving as a free agent in December.\nRegarding the position switch, Torkelson said on ESPN, \u201cIt\u2019s not a shock to me. I pride myself as (being) a baseball player, and a baseball player isn\u2019t stuck at one position. ... I pride myself on winning and getting the job done. If that\u2019s at third base, then that\u2019s what it is. I\u2019ll do my best over there and make it happen.\u201d\nThe most recent time a third baseman was selected No. 1 overall was 1992, when the Houston Astros selected Cal State Fullerton\u2019s Phil Nevin first.\nThe only first basemen who topped the draft were Ron Blomberg (1967) and Adrian Gonzalez (2000), both left-handed hitters. Torkelson is a right-handed hitter.\nTorkelson, 20, had a .340 average, six homers and 11 RBIs in 17 games during the 2020 season, which was abbreviated due to the coronavirus pandemic. He didn\u2019t play at third base in 2020.\nIn three college seasons overall, he produced a .337 batting average, a .463 on-base percentage, a .729 slugging percentage, 54 homers and 130 RBIs in 129 games.\nTorkelson said on ESPN of his reaction to being drafted No. 1 overall, \u201cOh my goodness. I told my dad when it was five minutes after, \u2018You could punch me in the face right now and I wouldn\u2019t feel it.\u2019 It is just the biggest adrenaline rush and the happiest moment in my life to this date. It\u2019s unreal.\u201d\nTorkelson became the fourth No. 1 overall pick from Arizona State, joining outfielder Rick Monday (1965), left-handed pitcher Floyd Bannister (1976) and third baseman Bob Horner (1978).\nThe Tigers made the No. 1 overall pick for the second time in three years, having selected Auburn right-hander Casey Mize to open the 2018 draft. The only other time Detroit had the No. 1 selection, they selected Rice right-hander Matt Anderson in 1997. Anderson had a mediocre seven-year career in the majors, mostly as a middle reliever.\nWith the second overall pick, the Baltimore Orioles chose Arkansas outfielder Heston Kjerstad. The 21-year-old Texas native hit .448 with six homers and 20 RBIs in 16 games this year, leaving him with a .343 average, 37 homers and 129 RBIs in 150 career games for the Razorbacks.\nThe Miami Marlins used the third overall pick on University of Minnesota junior right-hander Max Meyer. In four starts this year, Meyer went 3-1 with a 1.95 ERA. He posted a 10-7 record and a 2.13 ERA while logging 187 strikeouts and 41 walks over 148 innings in 46 career appearances (15 starts) for the Golden Gophers.\nThe Kansas City Royals chose Texas A&M junior left-hander Asa Lacy with the fourth selection. Lacy went 3-0 with a 0.75 ERA in four starts this year and struck out 46 in 24 innings while allowing just nine hits. In three seasons with the Aggies, he went 14-5 with a 2.07 ERA, 224 strikeouts and 68 walks in 152 innings.\nVanderbilt junior infielder/outfielder Austin Martin, widely rated as one of the top two available prospects, fell to No. 5, where the Toronto Blue Jays selected him. The Jays announced him Wednesday as a shortstop.\nMartin hit .377 with three homers and 11 RBIs in 16 games this year, leaving him with a career bating line of .368/.474/.532 with 14 homers and 76 RBIs in 140 games for the Commodores.\nThe Seattle Mariners chose Georgia right-hander Emerson Hancock with the sixth pick, and the Pittsburgh Pirates drafted New Mexico State shortstop Nick Gonzales with the seventh selection.\nThe first high school player drafted was outfielder Robert Hassell III, who went No. 8 to the San Diego Padres. He played at Independence High School in Thompson\u2019s Station, Tenn.\nThe Colorado Rockies used the ninth pick on right fielder Zac Veen from Spruce Creek High School in Port Orange, Fla.\nRounding out the top 10, the Los Angeles Angels chose Louisville left-hander Reid Detmers.\nCommissioner Rod Manfred opened the draft broadcast with a speech in which he vowed that baseball would help spark positive change in light of protests over racism following the deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and others.\nThe broadcast then cut to shots of all of the team executives set to make the draft picks, each holding up a sign that read, \u201cBlack Lives Matter. United for Change.\u201d\nThis year\u2019s draft was reduced to five rounds as part of an agreement between MLB and the players union amid the coronavirus pandemic.

More than 6,300 people took part in the visitation, which ran for more than six hours, church officials said.\nFire officials said several people, apparently overcome by heat exhaustion while waiting in line, were taken to hospitals.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad he got the send-off he deserved,\u201d Marcus Williams, a 46-year-old black resident of Houston, said outside the church. \u201cI want the police killings to stop. I want them to reform the process to achieve justice, and stop the killing.\u201d\nThe public viewing came two weeks to the day after Floyd\u2019s death was captured by an onlooker\u2019s video. As a white police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes, an unarmed and handcuffed Floyd, 46, lay face down on a Minneapolis street, gasping for air and groaning for help, before falling silent.\nThe case was reminiscent of the 2014 killing of another African American, Eric Garner, who died after being placed by police in a chokehold while under arrest in New York City.\nThe dying words of both men, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe,\u201d have become a rallying cry in a global outpouring of rage, drawing crowds by the thousands to the streets despite health hazards from the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe demonstrations stretched into a third week on Monday.\n\u201cEven though it is a risk to come out here, I think it has been a very positive experience. You hear the stories, you feel the energy,\u201d Benedict Chiu, 24, told Reuters at an outdoor memorial service in Los Angeles.\n\u201cI\u2019m here to protest the mistreatment of our black bodies.

A judge ordered his bail raised from $1 million to $1.25 million.\nChauvin\u2019s co-defendants, three fellow officers accused of aiding and abetting Floyd\u2019s murder, were previously ordered held on $750,000 to $1 million bond each.\nAll four were dismissed from the police department the day after Floyd\u2019s death.\nUnleashed amid pent-up anxiety and despair inflicted by a pandemic that has hit minority communities especially hard, the demonstrations have reinvigorated the Black Lives Matter movement and thrust demands for racial justice and police reforms to the top of America\u2019s political agenda ahead of the Nov. 3 presidential election.\nProtests in a number of U.S. cities were initially punctuated by episodes of arson, looting and clashes with police, deepening a political crisis for President Donald Trump as he repeatedly threatened to order the military into the streets to help restore order.\nPOLICE \u2018DEFUNDING\u2019 STIRS CONTROVERSY\nDemocratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, who is challenging the Republican Trump in the election, met with Floyd\u2019s relatives for more than an hour in Houston on Monday, according to the family\u2019s lawyer, Benjamin Crump.\n\u201cHe listened, heard their pain and shared in their woe,\u201d Crump said. \u201cThat compassion meant the world to this grieving family.\u201d Floyd was due to be buried on Tuesday.\nIn Washington, Democrats in Congress unveiled legislation to make lynching a federal hate crime and to allow victims of police misconduct and their families to sue law enforcement for damages in civil court, ending a legal doctrine known as qualified immunity.\nThe bill also would ban chokeholds and require the use of body cameras by federal law enforcement officers, place new restrictions on the use of lethal force and facilitate independent probes of police departments that show patterns of misconduct.\nSlideshow ( 30 images )\nSome departments are already taking action. On Monday, the Los Angeles Police Commission said the city\u2019s police department had agreed to an immediate moratorium on training and using chokeholds.\nThe legislation does not call for police departments to be de-funded or abolished, as some activists have demanded. But lawmakers called for spending priorities to change.\nTrump pledged to maintain funding for police departments, saying 99% of police were \u201cgreat, great people.\u201d\n\u201cThere won\u2019t be defunding, there won\u2019t be dismantling of our police,\u201d Trump told a roundtable of state, federal, and local law enforcement officials at the White House.\nBiden opposes the movement to defund police departments but supports the \u201curgent need\u201d for reform, a spokesman for his presidential campaign said.\nSlideshow ( 30 images )\nA high-spirited atmosphere that prevailed over a series of mass demonstrations during the weekend was marred late on Sunday when a man drove a car into a rally in Seattle and then shot and wounded a demonstrator who confronted him.\nThe suspect, Nikolas Fernandez, told police he thought he could drive safely through the crowd, when his car was surrounded by protestors, a police report said. He was charged on Monday with assault.\nSeparately, a man described by prosecutors as an admitted member of the Ku Klux Klan and \u201cpropagandist for Confederate ideology,\u201d was arrested on suspicion of driving his pickup truck into a rally near Richmond, Virginia, late on Sunday.\nAlso in Richmond, a judge issued a 10-day injunction blocking plans by the state governor to remove a statue of Confederate General Robert E.

Williams got advice from the group\u2019s five other board members on an intended route for Saturday\u2019s march and reminded attendees to wear comfortable shoes.\n\u201cSometimes we argue over priorities. Sometimes we make compromises. But in the end, we keep the main thing the main thing - a cry for justice for all brothers and sisters,\u201d added LaBayne, who plans to become a civil rights lawyer.\nWednesday\u2019s sit-in attracted a diverse group of about 500 protesters who sat in front of a line of police officers. One volunteer successfully convinced a white officer to kneel with her, drawing cheers from the protesters.

Most unfolded with no major violence, in sharp contrast to heated clashes between marchers and police in previous days.\nThe outpouring of protests followed the May 25 killing of George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man who died after being pinned by the neck for nine minutes by a white officer\u2019s knee. A bystander\u2019s cellphone captured the scene as Floyd pleaded with the officer, choking out the words \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d\n\u201cI have cops in my family, I do believe in a police presence,\u201d said Nikky Williams, a black Air Force veteran who marched in Washington on Sunday. \u201cBut I do think that reform has got to happen.\u201d\nThe change in the tenor of the demonstrations this weekend may reflect a sense that the demands of protesters for sweeping police reform were resonating in many strata of American society.\nNine members of the 13-person Minneapolis City Council pledged on Sunday to do away with the police department in favor of a community-led safety model, a step that would have seemed unthinkable just two weeks ago.\n\u201cA veto-proof majority of the MPLS City Council just publicly agreed that the Minneapolis Police Department is not reformable and that we\u2019re going to end the current policing system,\u201d Alondra Cano, a member of the Minneapolis council, said on Twitter.\nMinneapolis City Council president Lisa Bender told CNN \u201cthe idea of having no police department is certainly not in the short term.\u201d\nRELATED COVERAGE\nMinneapolis council members say they will \"end\" police department after Floyd death\nMissouri man charged with murder in death of St. Louis retired cop: report\nSee more stories\nIn New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a series of reforms he said were designed to build trust between city residents and the police department.\nDe Blasio told reporters he would shift an unspecified amount of money out of the police budget and reallocate it to youth and social services in communities of color.\nHe said he would also take enforcement of rules on street vending out of the hands of police, who have been accused of using the regulations to harass minority communities.\nCurfews were removed in New York and other major cities including Philadelphia and Chicago.\nTALKING REFORM\nIn the nation\u2019s capital, a large and diverse gathering of protesters packed streets near the White House, chanting \u201cThis is what democracy looks like!\u201d and \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d\nA newly erected fence around the White House was decorated by protesters with signs, including some that read: \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d and \u201cNo Justice, No Peace.\u201d\nRepublican Senator Mitt Romney marched alongside evangelical Christians in Washington on Sunday, telling the Washington Post that he wanted to find \u201ca way to end violence and brutality, and to make sure that people understand that black lives matter.\u201d\nSlideshow ( 22 images )\nA common theme of weekend rallies was a determination to transform outrage over Floyd\u2019s death last month into a broader movement seeking far-reaching reforms to the U.S. criminal justice system and its treatment of minorities.\nThe intensity of protests over the past week began to ebb on Wednesday after prosecutors in Minneapolis arrested all four police officers implicated in Floyd\u2019s death.

REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo\nOnly 46% of Americans who identify as Republicans say the country is on the right track, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted last week. It is the first time that number has fallen so low since August 2017, when a rally organized by white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia led to violent clashes with counter-protesters.\nAs recently as early March, before the novel coronavirus forced widespread shutdowns across the country, about 70% of Republicans said they were optimistic about the country\u2019s direction.\nTrump\u2019s approval rating remains resilient at around 40%, with a large majority of Republicans still approving of his overall performance.\nBut sustained pessimism among Trump\u2019s supporters could portend potential weakness ahead of November\u2019s election, when he will face Democratic former Vice President Joe Biden, experts said.\nThirty-seven percent of Republicans said the country is on the wrong track; 17% of those said they would vote for Biden if the election were held now, while 63% still plan to cast ballots for Trump.\nIn an election most analysts believe will come down to a handful of closely divided states such as Michigan, Pennsylvania and North Carolina, even minor defections or a dip in turnout among the Republican ranks could imperil Trump\u2019s chances.\n\u201cIt probably should be concerning for the president, even though it\u2019s reasonable to say he still maintains strong support among Republicans,\u201d said Kyle Kondik, an elections analyst at the University of Virginia.\nRepublicans believe an economic rebound in the fall would bolster his prospects. Friday\u2019s jobs report showed more than 2.5 million jobs were added last month during the thick of the coronavirus pandemic. Trump touted the gains as the \u201cgreatest comeback in American history.\u201d\nTrump campaign spokeswoman Erin Perrine said in a statement, \u201cPolling is notoriously wrong. We are five months from the election and any polling now is not a clear indicator of election results. Pollsters were very wrong in 2016 and underestimate voters\u2019 enthusiasm for President Trump every time.\u201d\n\u2018THINGS ARE DEFINITELY WRONG\u2019\nThe pessimism among all Americans has grown since the end of February, when the pandemic began accelerating. But unlike Republicans, large majorities of Democrats and independents already felt the country was on the wrong track; fewer than 7 percent of Democrats and 19 percent of independents feel the country is headed in the right direction, down slightly from March, the poll showed.\nMatthew Knight, a 48-year-old resident in North Carolina who supported Trump in 2016, said he has been disappointed with Trump\u2019s response to the crises.\n\u201cJust think with everything going on, and Trump not helping matters, that things are definitely wrong,\u201d Knight wrote in an email to Reuters. \u201cI was going to vote for Trump, but if things don\u2019t get better, I may have to rethink that.\u201d\nReuters conducted interviews and email exchanges with more than a dozen Republicans who said the country was headed in the wrong direction, yielding a mix of responses.\nSome, such as Bill McMichael, a 62-year-old in politically divided Minnesota who hasn\u2019t voted for a Democratic presidential candidate in four decades, are considering voting for Biden out of disgust with Trump.\nA few admitted some misgivings but still plan to vote for Trump, either because they are more skeptical about Biden or trust Trump to revive the economy. Others blamed Democrats for the country\u2019s problems.\n\u201cThe last week sure shows you the direction the liberals are trying to drive this country,\u201d said Ken Wilamowski, 68, a retired General Motors engineer in Clarkston, Michigan, adding that Democratic governors have been too unwilling to confront protesters. \u201cPacifism is going to lose to anarchy every time.\u201d\nTrump has urged governors to \u201cdominate\u201d the streets and claimed that far-left radicals are primarily responsible for the violence. Protesters again gathered in Washington for a big demonstration on Saturday.\n\u201cIn normal political circumstances, having a 40% favorability would be terrible, but that\u2019s just not the world we live in right now,\u201d said Terry Sullivan, a Republican strategist who served as Senator Marco Rubio\u2019s presidential campaign manager in 2016. \u201cThe numbers really haven\u2019t moved in the last 3-1/2 years.\u201d\nTom Singer, a 57-year-old probation officer in Riverside, California, said Trump\u2019s presidency has been \u201cdysfunctional.\u201d Nevertheless, he said he would still likely vote for him in November because he trusts Trump will deliver where it matters most: on the economy.\n\u201cI\u2019m not happy with either candidate, but I have to look at the one who\u2019s going to have the greatest impact on me,\u201d he said.\nThe Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online, in English, throughout the United States and gathered responses from 1,113 American adults.

Wherever you live, whatever your circumstances, NO ONE deserves to die, especially at the hands of another because of their skin color,\u201d Chopra, 37, posted on Instagram. \u2063\u2063\u2063\nPeople were quick to call her out on social media for previously promoting an \u201cintense fairness moisturiser\u201d.\nThey also pointed at her role in 2008 Hindi film \u201cFashion\u201d in which she is ashamed of having sex with a black man.\n\u201cThanks for speaking out for black lives. But, maybe also stop supporting a skin bleaching cream which promotes anti-blackness,\u201d one user replied to Chopra\u2019s Instagram post.\nChopra, a former Miss World who became a star in both Bollywood and Hollywood, has said in past interviews that she regretted endorsing such a product as a young actress and that she is proud of her dark skin.\nShe was not immediately available to comment.\nActresses Sonam Kapoor Ahuja, Deepika Padukone and Disha Patani also faced criticism for their anti-racism social media posts while having featured in ads for skin fairness products.\nIndia\u2019s multi billion-dollar skin lightening industry has a host of products appearing to offer dark-skinned Indians a lighter, fairer and better version of themselves, often endorsed by the Bollywood\u2019s top actors.\nAfter years of criticism and campaigns against such products, many brands moved to calling them \u201cskin brightening\u201d, \u201cwhitening\u201d or \u201clightening\u201d creams and face washes.\n\u201cMost brands no longer want to be associated directly with being termed as \u2018fairness creams\u2019,\u201d said actor Abhay Deol, a vocal critic of fairness products and Bollywood\u2019s support.\nCritics say the film industry helps feed India\u2019s obsession with fair skin and bias against darker faces, with many pointing out it fails to represent the diversity of Indians.\nFor example, actors from southern states where most people are darker-skinned are rarely in mainstream Bollywood films.\nLast year, the film \u201cBala\u201d featured the story of a woman who suffered discrimination because of her complexion and actress Bhumi Pednekar had her skin darkened to play the role.\nSocial media users also questioned why Bollywood continued to write lyrics and dialogues that equated fairness with beauty.\nKangana Ranaut, a noted actress, spoke out against her Bollywood colleagues for promoting fairness products.\n\u201cThese people, especially Indian celebrities, the successful ones ... have been endorsing all kinds of fairness products and today shamelessly they stand and say black lives matter - I mean how dare they?\u201d she told the BBC in an interview last week.\nIndian-American comedian Hasan Minhaj took on Bollywood for the endorsements as well on his news-comedy programme \"Patriot Act\" on Netflix.

Some residents said they were marching as a way to try to move beyond their own community\u2019s past.\nJoe Plemon, 73, an elder at the First Evangelical Presbyterian Church, said he had prepared several Bible passages - laments - to read at the protest.\n\u201cWe have been challenged within my own denomination, and I know this is going on at other churches as well, to say, \u2018Let\u2019s not just wink at this, let\u2019s step up, let\u2019s admit the things that we\u2019re ashamed of and let\u2019s confess the places where we\u2019ve sinned.\u2019\u201d\nAnna was once known as one of the \u201csundown towns,\u201d or thousands of American localities where black people were not welcome, according to sociologist and historian James Loewen, who wrote a book about the phenomenon.\nWhile most national attention has been focused on massive demonstrations and violent clashes with police in the United States\u2019 biggest cities like New York and Los Angeles, hundreds of spontaneous demonstrations have popped up in little towns and rural areas across the nation in recent days.\nBuzzFeed reporter Anne Helen Petersen based in Missoula, Montana, has gathered a growing thread of local news reports and social media posts showing nearly 250 protests in smaller communities - some with just a few hundred residents - in all 50 states.\nMany of them are being held in conservative towns like Anna, which is 90% white and sits in a county where Republican President Donald Trump won 68% of the votes in the 2016 election.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t put our head in the sand,\u201d Plemon said. \u201cIt\u2019s good for us to step up and say we want to be part of the solution.\u201d\nOne of the mostly young organizers was 18-year-old Jenna Gomez from nearby Cobden, Illinois, who said she is used to seeing Confederate flags displayed by area businesses.\nGomez had thought maybe a handful of people would show up to the event when she and some others started a group chat about it.\n\u201cWe wanted to show everyone that we are not the past,\u201d she said at the rally over cheers and a call-and-response of \u201cUnited we stand!

Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, a Democrat who in April proposed increasing law enforcement funding, this week reversed course and said he would seek some $150 million in cuts to the Los Angeles Police Department.\nAfter video footage from upstate New York raised further questions about the handling of demonstrators by law enforcement, two Buffalo police officers seen on Thursday shoving a 75-year-old protester to the ground were suspended and placed under investigation.\nAll 57 members of a police tactical unit quit the unit to protest their treatment, media said.\nProtests over the death of Floyd have rocked cities including Atlanta, Denver, Detroit as well as many smaller communities.\nThe demonstrations have erupted as the public and businesses struggle to recover from sweeping lockdowns imposed to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus.

Below are edited highlights.\nFILE PHOTO: Protesters hold hands while shutting down highway exits and entries during a protest against the death in Minneapolis police custody of George Floyd, in St Louis, Missouri, U.S. June 4, 2020. REUTERS/Lawrence Bryant\nTrevor Hunnicutt: You say racism is killing black people right now in two ways. Can you explain how and why?\nBakari Sellers: Systemic racism is manifesting itself in the public lynchings of Ahmaud Arbery and George Floyd, as well as the state violence against Breonna Taylor. Black folk are also dying at startling numbers to COVID-19 due to systemic racism. One virus (systemic racism), two manifestations.\nTH: There are a plethora of books on how to talk about race. How are these books making a difference?\nBS: I\u2019m hopeful that when people read books by Marc Lamont Hill, Michael Eric Dyson, Ibram X. Kendi, Wes Moore, Symone D. Sanders or \u2018My Vanishing Country,\u2019 they not only get a sense of pride but also understanding. We have an empathy deficit in this country that can only be cured by empathy.\nLauren Young: Should consumers hold brands accountable for systemic racism?\nBS: I do believe that the voices of brands do matter and as we\u2019re having these moments of cultural awakening, I think that voices, if they\u2019re robust and strong, like Ben & Jerry\u2019s, mean a lot.\nI think that brands, individuals, celebrities, everyone is in a moment that we have to match. I\u2019m interested to see who does because we can hold them accountable, especially as black folks, with our spending power.\nTH: Could you talk about the rural/urban divide?\nBS: The systemic racism we have to highlight when tackling COVID-19 is one that plays itself out in the lack of access to quality care. Not only that, but living in food deserts, drinking dirty water, inhaling polluted air \u2014 they all lead to these preventable diseases, they all lead to these co-morbidities, which means that black folk die at higher rates.\nTH: Why do you believe Joe Biden needs a black woman as a running mate?\nBS: Black women in the Democratic party have just been simply thanked for far too long. It\u2019s time to empower them and give them a voice. My mom is going to vote for Joe Biden and so are her friends. We need to make sure voters are activated \u2014 meaning that black women will go out and make phone calls, get their sororities, stand up in churches on Sundays and do everything necessary to make sure that Joe Biden is elected president of the United States.\nLY: How can we overcome racism among different ethnic groups and minorities?\nBS: Stokely Carmichael defined racism as this: \u201cIf you want to lynch me, that\u2019s your problem. If you have the power to lynch me, then that\u2019s my problem.\u201d Racism is a power construct, and we have to treat it as such, and tear down the systems of oppression that hit all of those groups.\nEditing by Lauren Young and Daniel Wallis\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"url": "/article/idUSKBN23C088", "headline": "'How it's going ...'

Obviously my experience is just one along a continuum of black experiences, and I don\u2019t presume to speak for all black people (or even all black people at Goldman Sachs). But the past few months have been demoralizing, and family/friends/colleagues I\u2019ve spoken with and listened to across the firm and country seem to share this feeling. Being black has been nothing if not instructive. I\u2019ve learned history and why people live where they do and why those in positions of power often don\u2019t look like me. I\u2019ve learned that bad things are more likely to happen to black people solely because they\u2019re black.

As if our lives are expendable but we could never rebuild a Louis Vuitton store or a burned out Target. As if MLK\u2019s nonviolent philosophy allowed him to opt-out of death by white supremacy. As if COVID ravaging minority communities is an acceptable, inevitable cost, and our lives just aren\u2019t worth the points off GDP. It\u2019s a lot.\n\u201cMy family immigrated to the US in 1990; this weekend I realized that my earliest memory in the US was the assault on Rodney King (where a group of LAPD officers struck an unarmed citizen some 50 times and kicked him 8 times during a traffic stop in March 1991). The officers involved lied about the incident, which was captured on film by an amateur photographer. I remember seeing the video, footage from the protests, and King\u2019s famous \u201ccan we all get along?\u201d statement. Four officers were charged; all were eventually acquitted. Two weeks prior Soon Ja Du, an LA convenience store owner shot 15 year old Latasha Harlins in the back of the head. Du accused Harlins of attempting to steal a $1.79 bottle of orange juice; Harlins had cash-in-hand and police concluded that Harlins intended to pay. Du accused Harlins of stealing and grabbed her arm, Harlins punched Du, and Du shot Harlins as she attempted to leave the store. The jury found Du guilty of voluntary manslaughter and recommended the maximum sentence of sixteen years jail time. The trial judge overruled the jury recommendation, stating that Du behaved \u201cinappropriately\u201d but understandably. Du was sentenced to five years\u2019 probation, 400 hours of community service, and a $500 fine. An appeals court upheld the ruling 3-0 on April 21, 1992. A week later all four officers were acquitted in the King case, kicking off six days of protests which resulted in 63 deaths and eclipsed the city\u2019s Watts protests of 1965. As then the situation centered around violence against people of color with seeming impunity.\n\u201cA decade later, while I was living in Cincinnati, 19-year old Timothy Thomas was killed by a Cincinnati Police officer during a police pursuit in April of 2001. Thomas was pursued for 10 minutes by nine officers over 14 non-violent minor offenses, of which 12 were traffic violations. Thomas suddenly came in contact with a CPD officer, surprised, shot and killed Thomas at point blank range. The officer allegedly believed that Thomas was reaching for a gun, although subsequent investigations determined that he was likely adjusting his baggy pants. As is common in these cases, Thomas\u2019s life and death hinged on an officer\u2019s distinction between being uncomfortable and being afraid. And like many of these cases, the officer\u2019s claimed belief of bodily danger legitimized the use of deadly force. The protests lasted five days and centered around Cincinnati\u2019s Over-the-Rhine district, which was a predominantly black, heavily policed community where the shooting took place. The median household income in Over-the-Rhine was about $8,600 at the time but has since become whiter and wealthier through to gentrification. The Thomas incident also kicked off a local debate sometimes described as \u201crespectability politics,\u201d with some black leaders blaming black culture for Thomas\u2019s death and advocating behavioral changes. The issue was not the extra-judicial killing of a US citizen over \u201cdriving without a license\u201d citations; it was a lack of respect for law and order. If we as black people changed our behavior, pulled our pants up, and were respectable, all our problems would be answered. If our parents took a firmer hand, beat us when needed, and policed our behavior, law enforcement officials wouldn\u2019t have to. But NYPD officers discharged 41 rounds Amadou Diallo despite his being unarmed and having committed no crime.\n\u201cA decade later in November 2011, while I was living in Chicago I was leaving a rec-league dodge ball game when I was approached by two Chicago police officers. They asked where I was coming from and I explained. They then then told me that I matched the description of an individual who had reportedly stolen from a residence in the area. The description was a black male in shorts and a t-shirt; nothing else. No color for either article of clothing, and in a city with just under 1 million black people I was obviously the culprit. I\u2019d clearly spent too much time around hyper-rational people who respected me and knew where I went to school and how much money made. In a lapse of judgment I tried to explain how absurd it all was while presenting my ID and found myself slammed against the hood of a police cruiser. The officer who shoved me looked afraid more than anything, and while I was confident I could have taken both in a fair fight guns are scary so I worked to de-escalate the situation. I was basically living out my nightmare of at least the past 10 years, where I\u2019d decide whether to deploy lethal force to defend myself from law enforcement. I\u2019d previously decided that if things went left I would fight, rush to my apartment, call the legal counsel at my employer, and negotiate turning myself in. Fortunately de-escalating worked; the officers patted me down, jostled me a bit, emptied the contents of my wallet into the street one-by-one, and detained me for another ~20 minutes of shivering (I was in shorts and a t-shirt, standing outside in Chicago on a November evening). They finally let me go when another officer (possibly their superior) asked what they were doing and said \u2018That\u2019s not him.\u2019\n\u201cI went home and I cried for the first time in years. Then I filed a report with the Chicago Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA), complaint #1050215. Then I flew to London for a work trip, noted how well the Brits treated class-signaling blacks (obviously not the full story), and considered never coming back. But I returned to Chicago and gave an in-person statement. And I waited. And in February 2012 Trayvon Martin was killed by George Zimmerman. And I waited. And George Zimmerman was acquitted in 2013, impetus for the Black Lives Matter movement. And the head of IPRA resigned in 2013. And IPRA closed my complaint file claiming that their \u201cfindings of the events that occurred differed from the account provided\u201d without further detail. And in June 2014 I moved to New York to start a new job at Goldman Sachs. And in July of 2014 Eric Garner was killed by NYPD officers who approached him on suspicion of selling \u201cloosies\u201d (individual cigarettes) without the proper tax stamps (the New York City + State excise tax is $5.85 for a pack of 20 cigarettes). In August of 2014 Michael Brown was killed after allegedly stealing a box of Swisher Sweet cigarillos (approx. value $15), initiating several weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri.\n\u201cAnd in 2015 news broke that the Chicago PD had been running a \u201cblack-site\u201d undisclosed interrogation facility in the Homan Square neighborhood where over 7,000 civilians were detained since 2004; 80% of the detainees were black Americans. And the new head of IPRA resigned. And a city of Chicago lawyer resigned after burying evidence related to the killing of Darius Pinex by two CPD officers in 2011. The previous ruling (in which the shooting was deemed justified) was later thrown out, and a retrial was ordered.\n\u201cAnd some years passed, and the story played out several more times. And in 2018 Lorenzo Davis, a former IPRA investigator was awarded a $2.8mm settlement after a Cook County jury found that he was fired after refusing to change his recommendations re: police shootings he deemed unjustified (which was good-ish). And some years passed. And on February 23, 2020, Ahmaud Arbery was ambushed and killed by a former police officer and his son in Glynn County, Georgia. On March 13, 2020 Breonna Taylor was killed by Louisville Metro Police officers serving a \u2018no-knock warrant\u2019 related to two individuals already in police custody. Kenneth Walker (Taylor\u2019s partner at the time) fired upon the officers with a licensed and then called 911 to report the home invasion and shooting of his girlfriend. Kenneth was initially charged with first-degree assault and attempted murder of a police officer (charges were dropped in May 2020). George Floyd was killed on May 25, 2020 after Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds (while Floyd was hand-cuffed and lying face down). Floyd was extra-judicially killed on suspicion of using a counterfeit $20 bill at a local market. And some NYPD SUVs drove through a crowd on Saturday. And some Minnesota police officers screamed \u201cLight \u2018em up!\u201d before firing on a woman and her family while they stood on their front porch in accordance with the curfew.\n\u201cSo as to how it\u2019s going- it\u2019s not great.\nFred\n\u201cp.s. That was heavy huh? Thanks for reading! I appreciate that many of you will seek to reach out, express solidarity, etc. And while that would be greatly appreciated, here are some things I\u2019d appreciate even more:\n- Reaching out to and supporting diverse analysts and associates within the firm; a common bit of feedback from our junior colleagues is that while our firm expresses a commitment to equality and social justice up top, they don\u2019t necessarily see commitment and support from their direct managers (the VPs and MDs they interact with more regularly). I\u2019ll be okay; look after them.\n- Donate money to advocacy organizations (don\u2019t want to violate firm policy here; MDs+ feel free to reach out for recommendations, happy to brainstorm with everyone else). Also worth noting that there are six times as many white Americans as black Americans (suspect even more skewed at GS). The more people we can get off the sidelines, the better.\n- Donate time to same (obviously we\u2019re all busy, isolating, etc; I wish I were better about this myself. Same point as above applies)\n- Support minority-owned businesses. Policing is closely tied to class, just as socioeconomics are closely tied to race. Our society naturally defends vested economic interests, and while it won\u2019t solve everything economic empowerment and sociopolitical empowerment are closely linked. And the inter-racial wealth gap is huge.\n\u201cp.s.s. As always, happy to chat about anything discussed above; feedback welcome. And if you\u2019re one of the analysts/associates I mentioned above, please reach out to me.\n\u201cp.s.s.s. Also happy to share book recommendations, articles about race/experiences/social inequity; anti-racism materials for parents + regular folks; etc.\u201d\nReporting by Imani Moise in New York and Sinead Cruise in London; Editing by Michelle Price and Grant McCool\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"url": "/article/idUSL4N2DI03O", "headline": "TEXT-'How it's going ...'

But I returned to Chicago and gave an in-person statement. And I waited. And in February 2012 Trayvon Martin was killed by George Zimmerman. And I waited. And George Zimmerman was acquitted in 2013, impetus for the Black Lives Matter movement. And the head of IPRA resigned in 2013. And IPRA closed my complaint file claiming that their \u201cfindings of the events that occurred differed from the account provided\u201d without further detail. And in June 2014 I moved to New York to start a new job at Goldman Sachs. And in July of 2014 Eric Garner was killed by NYPD officers who approached him on suspicion of selling \u201cloosies\u201d (individual cigarettes) without the proper tax stamps (the New York City + State excise tax is $5.85 for a pack of 20 cigarettes). In August of 2014 Michael Brown was killed after allegedly stealing a box of Swisher Sweet cigarillos (approx. value $15), initiating several weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri.\n\u201cAnd in 2015 news broke that the Chicago PD had been running a \u201cblack-site\u201d undisclosed interrogation facility in the Homan Square neighborhood where over 7,000 civilians were detained since 2004; 80% of the detainees were black Americans. And the new head of IPRA resigned. And a city of Chicago lawyer resigned after burying evidence related to the killing of Darius Pinex by two CPD officers in 2011. The previous ruling (in which the shooting was deemed justified) was later thrown out, and a retrial was ordered.\n\u201cAnd some years passed, and the story played out several more times. And in 2018 Lorenzo Davis, a former IPRA investigator was awarded a $2.8mm settlement after a Cook County jury found that he was fired after refusing to change his recommendations re: police shootings he deemed unjustified (which was good-ish). And some years passed. And on February 23, 2020, Ahmaud Arbery was ambushed and killed by a former police officer and his son in Glynn County, Georgia. On March 13, 2020 Breonna Taylor was killed by Louisville Metro Police officers serving a \u2018no-knock warrant\u2019 related to two individuals already in police custody. Kenneth Walker (Taylor\u2019s partner at the time) fired upon the officers with a licensed and then called 911 to report the home invasion and shooting of his girlfriend. Kenneth was initially charged with first-degree assault and attempted murder of a police officer (charges were dropped in May 2020). George Floyd was killed on May 25, 2020 after Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds (while Floyd was hand-cuffed and lying face down). Floyd was extra-judicially killed on suspicion of using a counterfeit $20 bill at a local market. And some NYPD SUVs drove through a crowd on Saturday. And some Minnesota police officers screamed \u201cLight \u2018em up!\u201d before firing on a woman and her family while they stood on their front porch in accordance with the curfew.\n\u201cSo as to how it\u2019s going- it\u2019s not great.\nFred\n\u201cp.s.

I\u2019ll be okay; look after them.\n- Donate money to advocacy organizations (don\u2019t want to violate firm policy here; MDs+ feel free to reach out for recommendations, happy to brainstorm with everyone else). Also worth noting that there are six times as many white Americans as black Americans (suspect even more skewed at GS). The more people we can get off the sidelines, the better.\n- Donate time to same (obviously we\u2019re all busy, isolating, etc; I wish I were better about this myself. Same point as above applies)\n- Support minority-owned businesses. Policing is closely tied to class, just as socioeconomics are closely tied to race. Our society naturally defends vested economic interests, and while it won\u2019t solve everything economic empowerment and sociopolitical empowerment are closely linked. And the inter-racial wealth gap is huge.\n\u201cp.s.s. As always, happy to chat about anything discussed above; feedback welcome. And if you\u2019re one of the analysts/associates I mentioned above, please reach out to me.\n\u201cp.s.s.s.

REUTERS/Eric Miller\nThe union\u2019s labor contract with the city is a formidable roadblock to citizens seeking disciplinary action after aggressive encounters with police. Led by Lieutenant Bob Kroll, the union\u2019s vocal and hard-charging president for five years, officers rarely face sanctions, Reuters has found.\nA Reuters analysis of complaints against Minneapolis police officers from the past eight years shows that 9 of every 10 accusations of misconduct were resolved without punishment or intervention aimed at changing an officer\u2019s behavior. The analysis covers about 3,000 complaints during that period; five officers were fired.\nThe Minneapolis union contract is not unusual. Dozens of other contracts across the United States contain provisions that stymie efforts to hold cops accountable for violence and other alleged abuses, a 2017 Reuters investigation found. The news agency examined contracts in 82 cities for that article and found that 46 required departments to erase disciplinary records, some after just six months. The absence of a paper trail makes firing officers with a history of abuses difficult, lawyers and police chiefs say.\nCompounding the challenge for citizens seeking justice: a U.S. legal doctrine called qualified immunity. A Reuters investigation last month found that the concept, created and reinforced in a series of U.S. Supreme Court rulings, increasingly shields from civil liability officers who are accused of using excessive force.\n\u201cYou have immune police officers who are beyond punishment because of their union contract as well as constitutional law,\u201d said Gloria Browne-Marshall, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York.\n\u201cThat combination leads to an arrogance of a police officer who can kill a man in broad daylight while being taped and believe he can get away with it,\u201d said Browne-Marshall, who teaches constitutional law. \u201cWhen there are no consequences, that\u2019s when people act with impunity.\u201d\nTo see the prior Reuters special reports, click here and here\nIn Minneapolis, officers have successfully used the qualified immunity doctrine to win civil lawsuits against them in federal courts. It is difficult to identify all excessive force lawsuits in federal court records, but Reuters found 28 such cases from 2006 through 2018 in which Minneapolis police officers raised a qualified immunity defense. Judges sided with the officers in 15 of those, ending the cases without a jury trial.\nThe union contract and the qualified immunity doctrine play a role in emboldening some officers to commit abuses, legal scholars say, but they don\u2019t always provide a shield in cases that trigger criminal charges or unleash national media scrutiny -- as has now happened in Minneapolis.\nCRIMINAL CHARGES\nAll four officers present in the death of Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, have been criminally charged in the case. The state\u2019s attorney general on Wednesday charged Derek Chauvin with second-degree murder and Tou Thao, J. Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane with aiding and abetting second-degree murder.\nThe county attorney had charged Chauvin on Friday with third-degree murder and manslaughter. The state\u2019s attorney general, Keith Ellison, said Wednesday that he and the prosecutor now believe the evidence warrants the stronger charge.\nGraphic videos show Chauvin, who is white, kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck for more than eight minutes as the unarmed man gasped for breath and groaned, \u201cPlease, I can\u2019t breathe.\u201d\nKueng and Lane also restrained Floyd, while Thao stood nearby.\nChauvin was jailed Friday, and the other three were booked Wednesday. All four officers were fired soon after the incident.\nIn a letter to union members on Monday, Federation president Kroll wrote that he was working with the union\u2019s labor attorneys to get each of the officers reinstated.\n\u201cThey were terminated without due process,\u201d Kroll wrote.\nWARRIOR-STYLE POLICING\nSince Floyd\u2019s death, the usually outspoken Kroll has said little in public. He did not respond to interview requests from Reuters. In Monday\u2019s letter, he criticized elected leaders for their handling of widespread protests in the wake of Floyd\u2019s death. He praised the city\u2019s police officers for their response to \u201cthe largest scale riot Minneapolis has ever seen\u201d and characterized the unrest as a \u201cterrorist movement\u201d that has been building for years.\nThat quickly drew blowback from city leaders. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey tweeted: \u201cFor a man who complains so frequently about a lack of community trust and support for the police department, Bob Kroll remains shockingly indifferent to his role in undermining that trust and support.\u201d\nSome Minnesota labor unions called for Kroll\u2019s resignation. Among them: the AFL-CIO, AFSCME, and Education Minnesota. In addition, the board of the Minneapolis Public Schools unanimously voted Tuesday to terminate its $1.1 million contract with the Minneapolis Police Department in response to Floyd\u2019s death. The department had provided officers to patrol schools.\nKroll, who became union president in 2015, has locked horns with police chiefs and mayors past and present. A key point of contention: Kroll\u2019s backing of so-called warrior-style policing, which conditions officers to view all encounters with residents as inherently dangerous. After Frey stopped the department\u2019s use of such training last year, Kroll announced the union would make the training free for any officer who wanted it.\n\u201cThe culture is that when they\u2019re coming into their jobs to police, it\u2019s like they\u2019re going to a war zone,\u201d said Joshua Williams, a human rights attorney in Minneapolis. \u201cThat\u2019s the mentality -- this is not their community.\u201d\nDISCIPLINARY HURDLES\nThe long-running antagonism between the police union and the community has hamstrung efforts by Minneapolis elected officials and reform-minded department leaders to change that mentality, one former chief says.\nJane\u00e9 Harteau, Minneapolis police chief from 2012 to 2017, said arbitration rulings and union grievances that reversed disciplinary actions made it difficult to create a culture of accountability in the department.\nSlideshow ( 2 images )\nAmong the contract provisions that impede efforts to discipline abusive cops is one that forbids the department from including allegations of misconduct in an officer\u2019s personnel file unless the accusations result in discipline. That means investigators cannot consider an officer\u2019s history of complaints while probing a new allegation.\nDuring investigations into misconduct complaints, the contract grants officers concessions that are not afforded to civilians suspected of wrongdoing. Officers are entitled to a written summation of the accusation and events, and they are given as long as two days to consider that information and to consult with a union representative before they can be called to give a statement to investigators.\nSuch \u201ccooling off\u201d periods are typical of police union contracts across the country, said Samuel Sinyangwe, a policy analyst, and they allow officers to \u201cessentially get their facts right\u201d before talking to the department\u2019s internal investigators.\nSome city officials say the very structure of the Minneapolis police union creates ethical concerns during the disciplinary process. Supervisors, who are in charge of discipline, are part of the same union that seeks to protect accused officers. Mayor Frey has sought to end this arrangement.\nEven when officers are fired for misconduct, the union contract allows them to petition an arbitrator for their job back. Should the four officers in the Floyd case be found not guilty in criminal court, they could seek reinstatement under the contract.\nTaxpayers often help pay to defend officers accused of misconduct, even in wrongful death. That is because the contract requires the city to provide legal representation to defend against job-related charges.\nA FRUSTRATED CHIEF\nIn an interview, Harteau, the city\u2019s first female chief and its first openly gay chief, cited particular frustration with how long it took to get one Minneapolis police officer with a long history of citizen complaints off the force.\nIn 2016, she fired Officer Blayne Lehner for violating the department\u2019s use of force policy after video showed him repeatedly throwing a woman to the ground while responding to a domestic disturbance. Over his 18-year career, he had accumulated more than 30 complaints. An arbitrator, concluding that Lehner\u2019s use of force was not \u201csubstantially inappropriate,\u201d overturned the chief\u2019s decision and reduced the sanction to a 40-hour suspension without pay.\nLehner stayed on the force for three more years, until he was fired last year after another accusation of excessive force. The same arbitrator, Stephen Befort, upheld the termination.\n\u201cThese cases are difficult and every arbitrator I know agonizes over the appropriate outcome,\u201d Befort told Reuters this week.\nLehner did not respond to a request for comment. In arbitration filings during the 2016 case, the union said his use of force was \u201cmeasured in its severity\u201d and that \u201cLehner\u2019s long and good work should be treated as a mitigating factor.\u201d\nJim Pasco, executive director of the Fraternal Order of Police, the nation\u2019s largest law enforcement union, said it\u2019s easy to blame union contracts when clashes between police and civilians spark public outrage. But cities have a role in shaping those contracts, too.\n\u201cIt\u2019s become a blame game,\u201d Pasco said. \u201cThe thing that critics never say is that contracts aren\u2019t forced down the throats of anyone. They are negotiated.\u201d\nPolice unions do not \u201crecruit, screen or supervise officers,\u201d he said, suggesting that low hiring standards, inadequate training and lack of supervision by top management undermine the quality of police forces. \u201cNot everyone is suited to be a police officer,\u201d Pasco said.\nThe FOP represents more than 2,000 law enforcement agencies, but it does not represent the Minneapolis Police Department, which has its own union.\nBLUE WALL OF SILENCE\nHarteau did have some successes. She began training to help officers recognize implicit biases, and in 2016, she rolled out the department\u2019s body camera program, despite fierce opposition from the union.\nShe said she met resistance \u201cat just about every turn\u201d from the police federation. She said Floyd\u2019s death shows how the culture among Minneapolis rank-and-file discourages intervening when a colleague is out of line.\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe we hire bad cops,\u201d former chief Harteau said. \u201cI think events occur and we let things go unchecked.\u201d\n\u201cThe union\u2019s perspective is we need to support the cops no matter what,\u201d she said. \u201cI support good work, but we cannot support or condone those that do not do a good job or act consistent with our core beliefs and values.\u201d\nKroll voiced his views on officer conduct following a police shooting in 2015. During a meeting, he told the legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota that he \u201cviewed policing and complaints like you view a basketball game, in that if you\u2019re not getting any fouls you aren\u2019t playing hard enough.\u201d\nACCUSATIONS OF RACISM\nKroll has himself been the subject of 10 misconduct complaints since 2013, police records show. The records don\u2019t disclose the allegations against him. None of the complaints resulted in discipline; one remains open.\nHe also was mentioned in a 2007 discrimination lawsuit filed against the department by five black officers. Among the plaintiffs: Medaria Arradondo, who was then a lieutenant in the force and is now the chief, having succeeded Harteau.\nIn court filings, Arradondo and his fellow officers alleged that the Minneapolis police force had \u201ca history of tolerating racist and discriminatory remarks by its white police officers.\u201d The suit described an incident in 1992 in which every African-American officer received a hate letter through the interoffice mail that threatened their lives. The letters were signed \u201cKKK,\u201d the suit said.\nThe lawsuit specifically called out Kroll. It alleged that Kroll referred to Keith Ellison, then a U.S. congressman, as a \u201cterrorist.\u201d Ellison, who is black and Muslim, became the state\u2019s attorney general in 2019 and is now helping to prosecute the four officers involved in the Floyd case. The suit also alleged Kroll wore \u201ca motorcycle jacket with a \u2018White Power\u2019 badge sewn onto it.\u201d\nThe police chief at the time sent an email to all employees denouncing the alleged comments, and Kroll told the St. Paul Pioneer Press that he thought Arradondo and the four other officers were on a fishing expedition. \u201cEver hear the phrase \u2018throw a lot against a wall and hope something sticks?\u2019\u201d he said then.\nThe suit was settled in 2009 for $740,000.\nArradondo, who became chief in 2017, has sought to stop at least one policing practice that disproportionately affects black residents. He ended low-level marijuana stings after the Hennepin County public defender found that almost every arrestee was black. On Sunday night, Arradondo said on CNN that Floyd\u2019s killing \u201cwas a violation of humanity.\u201d\nIn the wake of Floyd\u2019s death at the hands of a white officer, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz announced Tuesday that the state Department of Human Rights would begin a civil rights investigation into Minneapolis Police Department policies and practices over the last 10 years. Its mission: to determine if the department \u201chas engaged in systemic discriminatory practices towards people of color and ensure any such practices are stopped.\u201d\nA RARE SPLIT\nAs union president, Kroll has also clashed with the Hennepin County prosecutor. In 2018, Kroll defended officers who refused to be interviewed for the county attorney\u2019s 2018 investigation into the death of a 40-year-old white woman shot by a police officer in the alley behind her home.\nThe woman, Justine Damond, was barefoot and in her pajamas. The prosecutor, who eventually charged officer Mohamed Noor with murder, had to convene a grand jury and subpoena the officers to get their testimony. Noor, who pleaded not guilty to all charges, was convicted of third-degree murder and manslaughter, and was sentenced to 12-1/2 years in prison.\nThe incident marked a rare split between prosecutors and police in the United States, who typically work closely in pursuing cases. The prosecutor in the Noor case, Hennepin County Attorney Michael Freeman, is now involved in the prosecution of the four officers involved in Floyd\u2019s death. He declined to comment for this story, but in a 2018 statement to the media, he said he was left with no choice but to subpoena the officers in the Noor investigation.\nKroll defended the position of the officers in the Noor case, saying at the time that they were acting under the terms of the union contract. The contract, which remains in effect, specifies that police statements to investigators are voluntary and \u201cmade at the discretion of the officer.\u201d In an interview with a local radio station in 2018, Kroll said it was unfair to say the police had not cooperated.\n\u201cThe thing is, they were asked to come in for a voluntary statement, and not volunteering does not mean not cooperating,\u201d he said.\nReporting by Reade Levinson and Michael Berens.

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo\nThe Republican president in 2017 sought to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program created by his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama in 2012, but his move was blocked by lower courts. The program grants deportation relief and work permits - but not a path to citizenship - to 649,000 immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children.\nTrump is seeking re-election on Nov. 3. If the court sides with Trump and allows him to end a program whose enrollment is heavily Hispanic, he could risk further alienating a voting bloc that could play a crucial role in determining the outcome in election battleground states like Arizona and Florida.\nThe court, whose 5-4 conservative majority includes two justices appointed by Trump, heard arguments in the case in November and is expected to rule by the end of June or early July, but could do so as early as Monday. The conservative justices during the arguments signaled sympathy toward letting Trump terminate DACA.\nIf the court rules against him, Trump will have failed to live up to his 2016 campaign promise to end DACA, which he called one of Obama\u2019s \u201cillegal executive amnesties.\u201d\nIf the court sides with him, Trump could have several options on how to proceed, including ending DACA immediately or phasing it out over a period of time, potentially starting after the election.\nTrump also could try to make a deal with congressional Democrats to provide legal status to some Dreamers in exchange for changes that he would want to the U.S. immigration system. That would seem unlikely given his poisonous relationship with congressional Democrats dating to before and after they tried to remove him from office though impeachment.\nDemocrats control the House of Representatives and Republicans control the Senate. Previous talks between Trump and Democrats on DACA led nowhere.\nTrump has appealed to his conservative political base with his crackdown on legal and illegal immigration and his work toward a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border. But opinion polls show strong support among Americans for DACA. Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee to face Trump in November, served as Obama\u2019s vice president when DACA was created and backs DACA.\nRELATED COVERAGE\nFactbox: Who are immigrant 'Dreamers' and why is their fate tied to the U.S. Supreme Court?\nSeventy percent of Americans support DACA, according to a November 2019 survey conducted by the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, a consortium of more than three dozen universities. The survey also found backing among 75% of people who voted for Trump in 2016 but are undecided in 2020.\n\u2018A UNIFYING ISSUE\u2019\nThe Biden campaign said dismantling DACA would backfire on Trump.\n\u201cImmigration is a unifying issue for Latinos,\u201d Biden campaign senior adviser Crist\u00f3bal Alex said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re Puerto Rican, if you\u2019re born a citizen, you understand that attacks on Latinos based on immigration (are) really an attack on all Latinos.\u201d\nAny decision to end DACA could motivate Hispanic voters in pivotal states, said Stephen Nu\u00f1o-Perez, director of communications for the Seattle-based political opinion firm Latino Decisions.\nThe firm\u2019s polling shows immigrant rights ranking among the top issues for Hispanic voters, just behind the government\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic, healthcare and economic matters.\nAction by Trump to end DACA also could help convince undecided moderate, college-educated swing voters to choose Biden, even if they agree with Trump\u2019s economic message, according to Democratic pollster Nick Gourevitch of the New York City-based Global Strategy Group.\n\u201cGenerally speaking, voters are pretty sympathetic to Dreamers,\u201d Gourevitch said, noting that about 27,000 DACA enrollees are working in healthcare jobs during the pandemic. \u201cThe president likes to pick a lot of immigration fights, but I think the DACA immigration fight is a bad one for him to be having.\u201d\nSlideshow ( 3 images )\nTrump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said the president can differentiate himself from Biden on immigration. Biden, for example, supports allowing illegal immigrants to obtain medical insurance through the Obamacare law and he has vowed to pause deportations for 100 days after taking office.\nMurtaugh referred questions about DACA to the White House, which did not respond.\nRepublican election consultants do not see Trump\u2019s move to terminate DACA as a major liability.\n\u201cI think the downside for him is probably fairly manageable,\u201d Texas-based Republican consultant Matt Mackowiak said. \u201cI don\u2019t see DACA as an issue that affects Hispanics. DACA is an issue that affects DACA recipients.\u201d\nReporting by Ted Hesson; Additional reporting by Mica Rosenberg; Editing by Ross Colvin and Will Dunham\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"url": "/article/idUSKBN23839M", "headline": "PGA Tour recommends competitors to take COVID-19 test before attending events", "published_date": "2020-06-01", "text": "By Frank Pingue\n3 MIN READ\n(Reuters) - While COVID-19 testing will be a condition of competition when the PGA Tour resumes next week, at-home tests before travelling to a tournament are \u201cstrongly encouraged\u201d but not required, according to a participant resource guide issued on Monday.\nFILE PHOTO: May 12, 2020; Scottsdale, Arizona, USA; PGA golfer Kirk Triplett plays his second shot on the 10th hole during round one at the Scottsdale AZ Open at Talking Stick Golf Club's O\u00d5odham course.

REUTERS/Carlos Barria\nEven then, it is rare for officers to be charged criminally in such incidents, with the swiftness of the Floyd charges something of an anomaly.\nDerek Chauvin, the officer seen on a bystander\u2019s cellphone video kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck on Monday before the 46-year-old man died, was charged on Friday with third-degree murder and manslaughter.\nU.S. Attorney General William Barr on Friday said the FBI would conduct its own investigation.\nThe killing, the video of which has been widely viewed on social media and on television, spurred three nights of protest in Minneapolis that at times turned violent.\n\u201cThank God a young person had a camera to video it,\u201d Minnesota Governor Tim Walz said of Floyd\u2019s death, noting that in many instances no footage exists.\nIn contrast, an investigation into the March 13 killing by Louisville, Kentucky, police of emergency medical technician Breonna Taylor, in which there was no viral video, remains ongoing.\nThe FBI said it launched an investigation into her death on May 21, more than two months later. The city\u2019s police chief, Steve Conrad, will retire at the end of June, Louisville\u2019s mayor said the same day. None of the three officers involved in the raid have been charged as of Friday.\nThe sporadic nature of criminal charges frustrates civil rights activists.\nSlideshow ( 2 images )\n\u201cWe are not seeing officers held accountable at the rates they should be. The number of shootings of unarmed African-Americans far exceed the number of officers being held accountable,\u201d said Kristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.\nIn other high-profile cases, criminal charges have been brought after public protests, but not as quickly as in Minneapolis.\nIn Baltimore, police officers were charged over the death of Freddie Gray only after the aftermath led to riots. Gray was arrested on April 12, 2015 in an incident caught on video and subsequently given a \u201crough ride\u201d in the back of a police van, injuring his spine. He died of his injuries a week later and hundreds of people attended his funeral on April 27. Later that night, riots erupted in the neighborhood where he was arrested.\nFour days later, on May 1, the city charged six officers for their role in his death. All six were eventually cleared, and the federal Justice Department declined to charge anyone involved in the case.\nIn other cases there are no criminal charges, such as in the death of Eric Garner in New York in 2014, which was captured on video and led to protests. He died in a chokehold after repeatedly crying \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d -- a plea that became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement and was heard again in videos of Floyd\u2019s death.\nIn one illustration of the power of bystander video, groups representing law enforcement officers say they do not object to the additional scrutiny of either bystander video or cameras that officers are increasingly required to wear.\n\u201cWe favor the use of body cameras, and we don\u2019t have a position on the constitutional right of an individual in a public place to use a camera,\u201d said Jim Pasco, executive director of the National Fraternal Order of Police.\nHe also said he didn\u2019t see any particular problems with the speed with which charges were brought against Chauvin.\nReporting by Lawrence Hurley; Additional reporting by Andy Sullivan; Editing by Scott Malone and Daniel Wallis\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"url": "/article/idUSKBN2352RU", "headline": "India's Foreign Ministry asks some officials to quarantine after two positive for virus", "published_date": "2020-05-29", "text": "By Aditya Kalra\n2 MIN READ\nNEW DELHI (Reuters) - At least two people working at India\u2019s Foreign Affairs Ministry have tested positive for COVID-19, and the government has asked several officials to self quarantine as a precaution, according to a source and internal e-mails seen by Reuters.\nSlideshow ( 2 images )\nOne person who tested positive worked as a consultant in the ministry\u2019s Central Europe division in New Delhi, while the other worked as a legal officer in the law division, the e-mails stated.\n\u201cAs per protocol, all members of the CE Division have been asked to go for self quarantine for 14 days and work from home,\u201d the ministry advised in an internal e-mail on May 27, which was reviewed by Reuters.\nIn a separate email on Friday, all officials who came into direct contact with the legal officer, who tested positive for the new coronavirus, were also asked to self-quarantine.\nThe Foreign Affairs Ministry did not immediately respond to requests seeking comment.\nIt was not immediately clear how many officials have been asked to self quarantine.\nThe ministry is involved in many of India\u2019s critical coronavirus relief efforts, especially those relating to the evacuation of Indian citizens stranded overseas.\nIt has ordered sanitisation of rooms occupied by the Central Europe and legal division and those nearby, the source with knowledge of the matter said.\nLast month, about 500 people entered self-isolation in staff quarters of India\u2019s presidential palace after a family member of a sanitation worker living in employee quarters tested positive.\nThe number of COVID-19 cases are steadily rising in India.

REUTERS/Tyrone Siu\nNEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Hong Kong\u2019s unique brand of autonomy has been a gift for China. The city has been a channel for the world\u2019s most populous nation to get moderately richer without Beijing having to relinquish control over its economy and people. It is no longer essential to the mainland\u2019s future prosperity, however. Stripping it of the right to be treated differently from the People\u2019s Republic, as the United States has proposed, only shows how disposable that special status is.\nThe nearly universal agreement to consider Hong Kong distinct from China after Britain handed the territory over in 1997 has served four main functions. All are becoming less relevant. The first is the trade in goods. China\u2019s container ports are now sufficiently big and bustling that Hong Kong only accounted for less than 10% of shipments by volume in 2018, whereas before the global financial crisis its share was more than twice as much.\nThen there\u2019s the Asian financial hub\u2019s role as a spigot for capital movement. That\u2019s still important, but China relies less on such flows these days. Foreign investment was equivalent to around 15% of fixed-asset investment in 2000; last year it was roughly 1.5%. Some, in any case, consists of Chinese funds that leave and return dressed up as foreign money to get tax perks and other benefits. That transfer of value from the many to the few is hard to defend.\nHong Kong\u2019s special status also made it a launch pad for China\u2019s attempts to internationalize its currency. That project has been a failure. The currency remains stuck at less than 2% of global payments, according to network operator Swift, and less than 2% of global central bank reserves, based on International Monetary Fund data. Companies have used Hong Kong as a place to raise capital, but that is now available domestically too.\nPolitically, maybe the most important contribution Hong Kong\u2019s freedom makes is to serve as a tentative advertisement to Taiwan, the independently governed state China would like to reabsorb. Even there, the return on investment is dwindling. A Pew survey this month found that only 36% of Taiwanese respondents support closer political ties with the People\u2019s Republic, compared with 79% who favor closer ties with the United States.\nBeing positioned outside China\u2019s capital controls remains one of Hong Kong\u2019s important attractions. Beijing hasn\u2019t worked out how to turn mainland cities like Shanghai and Shenzhen into gateway regions, because of contradictory policy initiatives \u2013 on one hand, a drive to open up and attract foreign capital and knowledge, and on the other, a desire to keep capital and media controls intact. There, though, Hong Kong\u2019s success may even have held China back, by making those difficult decisions too easy to shirk.\nNone of this is to say Hong Kong doesn\u2019t matter, or that the loss of its freedoms wouldn\u2019t be a tragedy. It does, however, make the place a poor target for reprisals against the People\u2019s Republic. The enclave is unique only because it has rights China has chosen not to give to its other cities. That is a choice, and nothing more. Hong Kong is the most appealing way into China\u2019s economy, but no longer the way to its heart.\nBREAKINGVIEWS\nReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

Economic pressures and rising land prices have led many factories to move inland or to Southeast Asia over the last eight years, the band said.\nThe coronavirus has sped that up, with many of Henggang\u2019s migrant workers giving up on returning to Shenzhen after lockdowns kept them away.\n\u201cThe virus impact was huge,\u201d Wang says, frying noodles over a roaring flame in the cramped kitchen of his restaurant. \u201cNot so many people are working here now. Unless things change, maybe the restaurant will survive another two months.\u201d\nThe dip in business has forced him to take a job at a small cardboard box factory, but even there, he said, \u201cthere\u2019s just not enough work to go around.\u201d\nSlideshow ( 4 images )\nWE BUILT THIS CITY\nShenzhen grew quickly in from its rural roots in the 1980s into a gleaming symbol of China\u2019s emergence as a global economic power.\nBut with Shenzhen\u2019s government focused on next-generation industries, and some of China\u2019s highest property prices, lower-end manufacturers are being pushed out.\n\u201cTen years ago this area was all factories or dusty plots,\u201d Wang says on the 10-minute walk from the noodle shop to the band\u2019s practise studio.\n\u201cNow there\u2019s a subway, a highway, fancy malls,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now an apartment costs 3,200 yuan a month.

REUTERS/Tom Brenner/File Photo\n(Reuters) - Less than four months after a 57-year-old California woman died and was later found to be the country\u2019s first COVID-19 fatality, the coronavirus U.S. death toll topped 100,000 people on Wednesday, according to a Reuters tally.\nThe grim milestone is by far the largest of any country, although by population, several Western European countries, led by Belgium, have much higher death rates.\nThe outbreak set off a patchwork of responses by the 50 states and the District of Columbia, some of which were hammered by the global pandemic while others were barely touched.\nInitial actions ranged from sweeping business shutdowns and orders to shelter in place to less drastic guidance and regional closings. All states have loosened at least some restrictions in recent weeks, but still require or recommend precautions, such as social distancing or masks. Almost all states have ended in-class instruction at public schools for the academic year.\nBelow are summaries of how the states and the District of Columbia are coming back from the economic slowdown they orchestrated to combat the pandemic, based on Reuters reporting, a Reuters tally of infections and deaths as of Wednesday, and data compiled by the National Governors Association:\nALABAMA: 12 deaths per 100,000.

Large venues, such as movie theaters and sports arenas, were allowed to reopen on May 18, and restaurant bars could reopen on May 19, all with capacity limits.

Total cases: 113,195. Illinois has taken only tentative steps away from the stay-at-home order Governor J.B. Pritzker issued in March.

The couple had wed one month after Arizona\u2019s gay marriage ban was struck down in 2014.\n\u201cIt is gratifying to have the court today recognise the 43 years of love and commitment that my late husband and I shared, rather than looking only at the date on a marriage certificate that we were denied for most of our lives,\u201d said Ely.\n\u201cMy husband paid into social security with every paycheck, and I know he can rest easier now knowing that I, at last, will start receiving the same benefits as other widowers,\u201d he said in a statement.\nThe court certified the case as a nationwide class action, meaning other gay and lesbian spouses across the country who lost their wife or husband less than nine months after being married may now make similar claims.\n\u201cThis is a tremendous victory for many surviving same-sex spouses nationwide who have been locked out of critical benefits because they were unlawfully barred from marriage for most of their relationships,\u201d said Lambda Legal attorney Peter Renn.\n\"No one should be penalised for being the victim of discrimination,\" Renn said in emailed comments, adding that some surviving LGBT+ spouses had become homeless after being denied benefits.

REUTERS/Axel Schmidt\nThis article has been updated to include a response from Naomi Seibt, who is appealing the ruling made by the Landesanstalt f\u00fcr Medien NRW (Nordrhein-Westfalen) that ordered the removal of two of her YouTube videos. The headline and verdict of this article have been updated to reflect the fact that a final decision is pending. Reuters contacted Seibt prior to publication but did not receive a response until after this article was published.\n___________________\nA widely shared post on social media makes the claim that 19-year-old German climate change skeptic Naomi Seibt has been fined and banned from social media for expressing disagreement with climate activist Greta Thunberg, known for organizing youth climate strikes \u2018Fridays for Future\u2019. This claim contains some inaccurate information.\nThe post makes the claim that while Thunberg has been praised by the media, Seibt is now \u201cbanned from YouTube, Facebook and many other social media platforms\u201d, as well as \u201cfined the equivalent of $400 by authorities in her region of Germany for the crime of being \u2018not climate friendly\u2019.\u201d ( here ) \nSeibt \u2014 an influencer and YouTube personality \u2014 has garnered controversy for denouncing what she has called \u201cclimate alarmism\u201d, and for calling climate consciousness \u201ca despicably anti-human ideology\u201d ( here ).  \nHer public image has prompted comparisons with Thunberg, covered widely by the press for her vocal climate activism. Seibt has adopted some of Thunberg\u2019s communication for her own purposes, such as the cry popularly associated with Thunberg\u2019s address before the UN Climate Action summit last year: \u201cHow dare you?\u201d ( here ) \nIn February 2020, Seibt joined the Heartland Institute\u2014a right-wing American think-tank\u2014to work on \u201ccommunicating the climate realism message to her generation \u2013 which has marinated in apocalyptic nonsense their whole lives \u2013 for audiences in Europe and the United States,\u201d according to a press release ( here ). \nHeartland, according to the Washington Post, is concerned that Berlin\u2019s environmental policies could begin to spread overseas ( here ). James Taylor, director of the Arthur B. Robinson Center for Climate and Environmental Policy, told the Post that Seibt was a \u201cfantastic voice for free markets and for climate realism.\u201d \nIn late February, some outlets reported that Seibt \u201chas previously described a white nationalist who appeared to promote \u2018white genocide\u2019 theories as one of her \u2018inspirations\u2019\u201d ( here  ;  here ). Seibt has also spoken at events run by Germany\u2019s far-right AfD (Alternative for Germany) party, although she has denied formally being in the party, according to the Independent ( here ). \nAs of May 21, 2020, Seibt\u2019s YouTube ( here ) Facebook ( here ) and Twitter ( twitter.com/SeibtNaomi ) profiles, however, are all active. The claim that social media platforms have deleted her accounts for the views she has expressed is untrue.  \nIn April, Seibt posted a video on YouTube where she explained, in German, that she had chosen not to renew her three-month contract with the Heartland Institute. She claimed that her affiliation to Heartland resulted in the Landesanstalt f\u00fcr Medien NRW (Nordrhein-Westfalen) \u2014 a regional supervisory authority for private broadcasting \u2014 threatening to delete her YouTube account and her videos, alleging that through her collaboration with the American think-tank, she was spreading U.S. conspiracy theories in Germany ( here ). Seibt claimed that the allegation was not true, and that it violated her freedom of expression. \nA fundraising page for Seibt found on Climate Intelligence (CLINTEL) - an independent foundation that operates in the fields of climate change and policy - puts the situation in different terms. It claims that according to the Landesanstalt f\u00fcr Medien NRW, Seibt had advocated against Germany\u2019s climate policies while also discussing her ties to Heartland ( here ). The page later claims that the authorities \u201cdemanded a fine of about $400 and costs on top, and instructed Naomi that she must not mention the Heartland Institute in her videos. The insubstantial ground for this attempt at silencing Naomi was that such mentions constituted unlawful product placement under a recently-enacted law of the North-Rhine Westphalia region.\u201d \nThe Landesanstalt f\u00fcr Medien NRW confirmed to Reuters via email that it did not issue a fine to Seibt:\n\u201cMs. Seibt was requested to delete two YouTube videos because they violate German law. The basis of our decision is the prohibition of third party influence on the editorial content in audiovisual media according to articles 7 para. 7 sentence 1 in connection with 58 para. 3 sentence 1 of the Interstate Broadcasting Treaty (Rundfunkstaatsvertrag-RStV).\n\u201cMs. Seibt was heard on the facts of the case. Her statement was not able to invalidate the accusation of illegal thematic placement (in German \u201eThemenplatzierung\u201d). Unlike in America, in Germany it is prohibited by law to provide media content, if a third party has exerted influence on it and if the cooperation is based on a compensation. Unlike in America, in Germany Freedom of speech is not touched by this ban.\u201d\nIn an emailed letter to Reuters, Seibt\u2019s legal representative said Seibt had requested an extension of time to respond to the Landesanstalt f\u00fcr Medien NRW\u2019s allegations and had not received a reply. The Landesanstalt f\u00fcr Medien NRW told Reuters it maintained that Seibt was given sufficient time to respond.\nSeibt has since appealed against the decision and a court will now decide whether or not she must delete the videos. If the court upholds the decision of the Landesanstalt f\u00fcr Medien NRW, Seibt will either be ordered to remove the videos or pay a fine.\nSeibt\u2019s legal representative additionally told Reuters that Seibt felt her freedom of expression was affected by the German ban on thematic placement.\nVERDICT\nFalse. Naomi Seibt was not banned from social media platforms. Regional German telecommunication regulators have not fined Seibt, but have requested she delete two YouTube videos for violating German law. Seibt has appealed this decision and the matter will now be decided by a court.\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.

REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton\nThere are many stories about the lonely coronavirus deaths in the city\u2019s hospitals and the traumatic work of the nurses who staff them.\nMeghan\u2019s story is about unexpected opportunities. It\u2019s a story of how the pandemic gave a woman the chance to strike out into the world, confront danger and make a difference, and how her husband stayed home to care for their daughters. It\u2019s a story about new beginnings.\n\u201cI always wanted to do something for my country,\u201d said Meghan. \u201cThis was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to do something meaningful.\u201d\nMeghan\u2019s first nursing shifts in New York were a shock.\nMeghan Lindsey smokes a cigarette while swinging, as her daughter Braelyn, 9, looks on from the porch at their home in Neosho, Missouri, May 16, 2020.

The pandemic gave Meghan something that her life in Missouri so far had not: a feeling of everything sliding into place.\nWhen Meghan graduated from nursing school, it wasn\u2019t like she imagined. It turned out to be just a job. She mourned.\n\u201cNow for once, it\u2019s actually something important,\u201d said Meghan. \u201cThis is the first time since I\u2019ve become a nurse that it\u2019s like, \u2018yes, this is why.\u2019 I can make a difference, and I can help, and I am strong enough for this.\u201d\nHer kids, she said, are proud. \u201cThey know that what I\u2019m doing is hard and that I put my life in danger.\u201d\nMeghan Lindsey, who returned home after working five weeks at NYU Winthrop Hospital, holds her daughter Braelyn during Sunday morning service at the Joplin Family Worship Center in Joplin, Missouri, May 17, 2020.

Before he lost his job to the pandemic, her husband Aaron sold fire suppression systems to small businesses.\nMeghan is the first in her family to finish college and has long held her family together. As thrilling as it was to be in New York, it was also hard.\nMeghan often wondered if she should come home. Her husband Aaron told her no. He and the girls were fine, what she was doing mattered and he was proud of her. He sometimes called her superwoman.\n\u201cIf he wasn\u2019t such a good dad and there for my children, I could never do this,\u201d said Meghan. He deserves credit too, she said, \u201cbut I guess you could say the limelight\u2019s on me.\u201d\nMeghan Lindsey eats dinner by herself after her shift on Mother\u2019s Day at her hotel lobby in the Queens borough of New York, May 10, 2020.

Meghan had to wear protective gear during her shifts and there was a lengthy decontamination process when she got home each night. She lived in a hotel room with another nurse and had to find a laundromat every few days to wash her scrubs.\nBut sometimes it did feel like a grand adventure. She saw the Statue of Liberty.

But the coronavirus pandemic has chased visitors away, leaving residents and businesses unsure they can survive.\n\u201cNormally in May, we\u2019d be in full swing,\u201d said Sean Mackey, co-owner of the Magic Shuttle Bus in Traverse City that drives visitors to weddings and wineries.\n\u201cWe would have all buses on the road, tours every single day of the week,\u201d he said.\nInstead, the company did no business over Memorial Day weekend, the unofficial start to summer, as wineries were off limits to bus tours and groups of more than 10 people were banned.\nThe beginning of summer in states like Michigan, which have strict social distancing guidelines in place, contrasted sharply with crowds flocking to beaches in locations like South Carolina and New Jersey easing coronavirus-related restrictions.\nThe death toll in the United States from the novelcoronavirus has topped 100,000, according to a Reuters tally.\nEvery U.S. state has phased reopenings underway, but the plans typically forbid large gatherings and limit restaurant and bar capacities that will sink some businesses, owners say.\nIn Maine, \u201calready a number of businesses have closed down, and they\u2019re not going to open up again,\u201d said Jean Ginn Marvin, owner of the coastal Nonantum Resort in Kennebunkport.\n\u201cThe thing about seasonal businesses is they hold on by their fingernails anyway,\u201d she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. \u201cWe were just about to open our doors and have a little cash flow again, and that didn\u2019t happen.\u201d\nIn the tiny Michigan tourist town of Lake Ann, where Mackey lives, \u201cyou have a party store, a little library, an ice cream parlor, a brewery and a post ofice and that\u2019s it. You blink and you miss it.\u201d\nIn the depths of uncertainty about the pandemic is the possibility of closing down altogther and hoping for better times ahead, Mackey said - almost like a year-long hibernation.\n\u201cIf things got really bad, (businesses might) just close up for the season and try to put the bills on hold and open up going full swing next year,\u201d he said.\nWithout the summer business, entire towns will suffer, residents said.\n\u201cWhen those businesses fold, what goes with them is the guy who plays the piano in the lobby and those teenagers that go there for their first job,\u201d said Marvin. \u201cSo those kids aren\u2019t going to have money for college.\u201d\nUNCERTAIN PLANS\nThe quiet is unsettling in upstate New York\u2019s Saratoga Springs, where its historic track would normally be busy with young thoroughbreds in training, said Marianne Barker, who opened her gift store Impressions of Saratoga 42 years ago.\n\u201cThat usually brings a pretty big influx of people. We\u2019re not seeing that,\u201d she said.\nSummer plans for the Saratoga Race Course remain uncertain - one proposal calls for races without spectators - while another huge tourist draw, the Saratoga Performing Arts Center, just canceled its summer season.\n\u201cBoth of those combined will ... completely cut down on tourist-related activities,\u201d said Saratoga Springs Finance Commissioner Michele Madigan. \u201cWe are a tourism-dependent economy.\u201d\nThe two venues draw some 1.5 million people each summer, according to industry figures.\nPlunging tax revenues will leave the city up to $16 million short this year, Madigan said, and without federal aid, \u201cit\u2019s going to be devastation, not just here but everywhere.\u201d\nSaratoga Spring is looking at short-term borrowing of about $6 million, Madigan added, but as a one-time boost.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just keep borrowing our way out of this,\u201d she said. \u201cI think local governments are your next big wave of layoffs.\u201d\nLayoffs in the United States hit a record high of 11.4 million in March, the nation\u2019s worst job shortage since the Great Depression.\nFINANCIAL SUPPORT\nEarlier this month the U.S. House of Representatives approved a $3 trillion relief measure, dubbed the Heroes Act, with provisions aimed at helping state and local governments.\nThe relief bill has been criticized as a \u201cliberal wish list\u201d by Republicans who vowed to block it in the Senate, and President Donald Trump has promised to veto it.\nAs places like Saratoga Springs deplete their savings, \u201c2021 looks even more bleak,\u201d Madigan said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know when we\u2019re ever going to get back to a situation where we see revenues like they were pre-COVID. How comfortable are people going to feel going out?\u201d she said.\nHopefully soon, said Michigan State Sen. Ed McBroom, a Republican whose district includes the rural, tourist-reliant Upper Peninsula, among the state\u2019s first regions to reopen.\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be people who are afraid until they see other people out and about,\u201d he said in a phone interview.\n\u201cSo if other folks get out and about and nothing bad happens, then I think suddenly things could really pick up in a hurry.\u201d\nTourism accounts for seven in 10 jobs in the Upper Peninsula\u2019s northernmost Keweenaw County which juts into Lake Superior, according to the Michigan Economic Development Corp.\nIn Maine, some hospitality and retail industry groups have asked the governor to relax plans for a required 14-day quarantine for out-of-state visitors; dozens of other small businesses responded with a letter in support of the quarantine.\nA similar split is evident in Michigan, said Tom Nemacheck, who heads the Upper Peninsula Travel & Recreation Association.\n\u201cThose are the two camps that we\u2019re keeping an eye on,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe businesses that are so desperate that they want visitors no matter what because they\u2019re going bankrupt, and then ... some of the other people in the community are nervous about geting visitors.\u201d\nReporting by Ellen Wulfhorst, editing by Zoe Tabary.

But the coronavirus pandemic has chased visitors away, leaving residents and businesses unsure they can survive.\n\u201cNormally in May, we\u2019d be in full swing,\u201d said Sean Mackey, co-owner of the Magic Shuttle Bus in Traverse City that drives visitors to weddings and wineries.\n\u201cWe would have all buses on the road, tours every single day of the week,\u201d he said.\nInstead, the company did no business over Memorial Day weekend, the unofficial start to summer, as wineries were off limits to bus tours and groups of more than 10 people were banned.\nThe beginning of summer in states like Michigan, which have strict social distancing guidelines in place, contrasted sharply with crowds flocking to beaches in locations like South Carolina and New Jersey easing coronavirus-related restrictions.\nThe death toll in the United States from the novelcoronavirus has topped 100,000, according to a Reuters tally.\nEvery U.S. state has phased reopenings underway, but the plans typically forbid large gatherings and limit restaurant and bar capacities that will sink some businesses, owners say.\nIn Maine, \u201calready a number of businesses have closed down, and they\u2019re not going to open up again,\u201d said Jean Ginn Marvin, owner of the coastal Nonantum Resort in Kennebunkport.\n\u201cThe thing about seasonal businesses is they hold on by their fingernails anyway,\u201d she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. \u201cWe were just about to open our doors and have a little cash flow again, and that didn\u2019t happen.\u201d\nIn the tiny Michigan tourist town of Lake Ann, where Mackey lives, \u201cyou have a party store, a little library, an ice cream parlor, a brewery and a post ofice and that\u2019s it. You blink and you miss it.\u201d\nIn the depths of uncertainty about the pandemic is the possibility of closing down altogther and hoping for better times ahead, Mackey said - almost like a year-long hibernation.\n\u201cIf things got really bad, (businesses might) just close up for the season and try to put the bills on hold and open up going full swing next year,\u201d he said.\nWithout the summer business, entire towns will suffer, residents said.\n\u201cWhen those businesses fold, what goes with them is the guy who plays the piano in the lobby and those teenagers that go there for their first job,\u201d said Marvin. \u201cSo those kids aren\u2019t going to have money for college.\u201d\nUNCERTAIN PLANS\nThe quiet is unsettling in upstate New York\u2019s Saratoga Springs, where its historic track would normally be busy with young thoroughbreds in training, said Marianne Barker, who opened her gift store Impressions of Saratoga 42 years ago.\n\u201cThat usually brings a pretty big influx of people. We\u2019re not seeing that,\u201d she said.\nSummer plans for the Saratoga Race Course remain uncertain - one proposal calls for races without spectators - while another huge tourist draw, the Saratoga Performing Arts Center, just canceled its summer season.\n\u201cBoth of those combined will ... completely cut down on tourist-related activities,\u201d said Saratoga Springs Finance Commissioner Michele Madigan. \u201cWe are a tourism-dependent economy.\u201d\nThe two venues draw some 1.5 million people each summer, according to industry figures.\nPlunging tax revenues will leave the city up to $16 million short this year, Madigan said, and without federal aid, \u201cit\u2019s going to be devastation, not just here but everywhere.\u201d\nSaratoga Spring is looking at short-term borrowing of about $6 million, Madigan added, but as a one-time boost.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just keep borrowing our way out of this,\u201d she said. \u201cI think local governments are your next big wave of layoffs.\u201d\nLayoffs in the United States hit a record high of 11.4 million in March, the nation\u2019s worst job shortage since the Great Depression.\nFINANCIAL SUPPORT\nEarlier this month the U.S. House of Representatives approved a $3 trillion relief measure, dubbed the Heroes Act, with provisions aimed at helping state and local governments.\nThe relief bill has been criticized as a \u201cliberal wish list\u201d by Republicans who vowed to block it in the Senate, and President Donald Trump has promised to veto it.\nAs places like Saratoga Springs deplete their savings, \u201c2021 looks even more bleak,\u201d Madigan said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know when we\u2019re ever going to get back to a situation where we see revenues like they were pre-COVID. How comfortable are people going to feel going out?\u201d she said.\nHopefully soon, said Michigan State Sen. Ed McBroom, a Republican whose district includes the rural, tourist-reliant Upper Peninsula, among the state\u2019s first regions to reopen.\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be people who are afraid until they see other people out and about,\u201d he said in a phone interview.\n\u201cSo if other folks get out and about and nothing bad happens, then I think suddenly things could really pick up in a hurry.\u201d\nTourism accounts for seven in 10 jobs in the Upper Peninsula\u2019s northernmost Keweenaw County which juts into Lake Superior, according to the Michigan Economic Development Corp.\nIn Maine, some hospitality and retail industry groups have asked the governor to relax plans for a required 14-day quarantine for out-of-state visitors; dozens of other small businesses responded with a letter in support of the quarantine.\nA similar split is evident in Michigan, said Tom Nemacheck, who heads the Upper Peninsula Travel & Recreation Association.\n\u201cThose are the two camps that we\u2019re keeping an eye on,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe businesses that are so desperate that they want visitors no matter what because they\u2019re going bankrupt, and then ... some of the other people in the community are nervous about geting visitors.\u201d\nReporting by Ellen Wulfhorst, editing by Zoe Tabary.

It\u2019s a story about new beginnings.\n\u201cI always wanted to do something for my country,\u201d said Meghan. \u201cThis was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to do something meaningful.\u201d\nMeghan\u2019s first nursing shifts in New York were a shock.\nMeghan Lindsey smokes a cigarette while swinging, as her daughter Braelyn, 9, looks on from the porch at their home in Neosho, Missouri, May 16, 2020.

The pandemic gave Meghan something that her life in Missouri so far had not: a feeling of everything sliding into place.\nWhen Meghan graduated from nursing school, it wasn\u2019t like she imagined. It turned out to be just a job. She mourned.\n\u201cNow for once, it\u2019s actually something important,\u201d said Meghan. \u201cThis is the first time since I\u2019ve become a nurse that it\u2019s like, \u2018yes, this is why.\u2019 I can make a difference, and I can help, and I am strong enough for this.\u201d\nHer kids, she said, are proud. \u201cThey know that what I\u2019m doing is hard and that I put my life in danger.\u201d\nMeghan Lindsey, who returned home after working five weeks at NYU Winthrop Hospital, holds her daughter Braelyn during Sunday morning service at the Joplin Family Worship Center in Joplin, Missouri, May 17, 2020.

As thrilling as it was to be in New York, it was also hard.\nMeghan often wondered if she should come home. Her husband Aaron told her no. He and the girls were fine, what she was doing mattered and he was proud of her. He sometimes called her superwoman.\n\u201cIf he wasn\u2019t such a good dad and there for my children, I could never do this,\u201d said Meghan.

He proved to be an important catch.\nFILE PHOTO: Cilia Flores (C), deputy of Venezuela's United Socialist Party (PSUV) and wife of Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro, and her fellow deputy Diosdado Cabello (R) attend a session of the National Assembly in Caracas January 22, 2016. REUTERS/Marco Bello/File Photo\nThe man, Yazenky Lamas, worked as a bodyguard for the person widely considered the power behind President Nicolas Maduro\u2019s throne: first lady Cilia Flores.\nNow, with help from Lamas\u2019 testimony, the United States is preparing to charge Flores in coming months with crimes that could include drug trafficking and corruption, four people familiar with the investigation of the first lady told Reuters.\nIf Washington goes ahead with an indictment, these people said, the charges are likely to stem, at least in part, from a thwarted cocaine transaction that has already landed two of Flores\u2019 nephews in a Florida penitentiary.\nNicole Navas, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Justice, declined to comment on any possible charges against Flores. Flores and her office at the National Assembly didn\u2019t respond to questions for this article.\nJorge Rodriguez, Venezuela\u2019s information minister, told Reuters in a text message that its questions about the possible U.S. indictment of Flores were \u201cnauseating, slanderous and offensive.\u201d He didn\u2019t elaborate.\nIn a series of interviews with Reuters, the first Lamas has given since his arrest, the former bodyguard said Flores was aware of the coke-trafficking racket for which her two nephews were convicted by a U.S. court. Flores also used her privileged position, he said, to reward family members with prominent and well-paid positions in government, a claim of nepotism backed by others interviewed for this article.\nSpeaking behind reinforced glass at the prison in Washington, D.C., where he is detained, Lamas told Reuters he is speaking out against Flores because he feels abandoned by the Maduro administration, still ensconced in power even though many of its central figures, including the president, have also been accused of crimes. \u201cI feel betrayed by them,\u201d he told Reuters.\nIn late March, U.S. prosecutors indicted Maduro and over a dozen current and former Venezuelan officials on charges of narco-terrorism and drug smuggling. Maduro, now in his eighth year as Venezuela\u2019s president, for years sought to flood the U.S. with cocaine, prosecutors alleged, seeking to weaken American society and bolster his position and wealth.\nMaduro\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. In a televised speech after the indictments, he dismissed the charges against him and his colleagues as a politically motivated fabrication by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump. \u201cYou are a miserable person, Donald Trump,\u201d he said.\nThe March indictments and the possible charges against Flores come amid a fresh campaign by Washington to increase pressure on Maduro. His enduring grip on power, some U.S. officials say, is a source of frustration for Trump.\nStarting in 2017, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned the Socialist leader along with his wife and other members of the Maduro \u201cinner circle.\u201d The swipe at Flores enraged Maduro. \u201cIf you want to attack me, attack me,\u201d he said in a televised speech at the time. \u201cBut don\u2019t mess with Cilia, don\u2019t mess with the family.\u201d\nLeveraging the economic fallout from the coronavirus crisis in Venezuela, the White House now hopes it can topple a leader who has weathered years of tightening economic sanctions, civil unrest and international isolation.\nWashington has accused Maduro and his circle of looting Venezuela of billions of dollars. But it\u2019s unclear how much personal wealth he and Flores possess. Neither the president nor the first lady disclose income statements, tax returns or other documents pertaining to their personal finances.\nAfter U.S. prosecutors charged Maduro, the Justice Department said it had seized more than $1 billion in assets belonging to dozens of defendants connected to the case. The charges didn\u2019t detail those assets or specify who holds them.\nFlores is a longtime strategist and kingmaker in the ruling Socialist party. She first gained prominence as a lawmaker and confidante of the late Hugo Chavez, Maduro\u2019s predecessor and mentor. She doesn\u2019t hold an official role in Maduro\u2019s cabinet.\nStill, the probe against her underscores the vast influence she wields, particularly in helping Maduro outmaneuver rivals inside and outside Venezuela.\nIn addition to Lamas, Reuters interviewed more than 20 people close to and familiar with Flores. They portray her as a shrewd and stealthy politician who now brandishes much of the power of her husband\u2019s office, demanding important briefings even before the president and personally negotiating with foreign emissaries, rival lawmakers and others.\nWhen the opposition-led National Assembly tried to oust Maduro last year, Flores ordered security officials to deliver intelligence on the matter directly to her, according to Manuel Cristopher Figuera, the head of the country\u2019s intelligence agency then.\nFiguera was one of a handful of senior Venezuelan officials who at the time considered trying to negotiate an exit from power by Maduro with the United States. Figuera fled Venezuela when the effort failed.\n\u201cFlores has always been behind the curtain, pulling the strings,\u201d Figuera told Reuters.\nFlores has sought personal concessions in recent years in negotiations with the United States.\nAccording to five people familiar with the discussions, Flores instructed intermediaries to ask U.S. envoys for liberty for her jailed nephews. In exchange, these intermediaries said Venezuela would release six imprisoned executives of Citgo Petroleum Corp [PDVSAC.UL], the U.S. refining unit of Venezuela\u2019s state-run oil company.\nThe executives, arrested by Venezuela in 2017 and charged with embezzlement, are widely considered by human rights activists and many in the business community to be political prisoners.\nThat overture, reported here for the first time, failed.\nBut Washington knows Flores\u2019 clout. \u201cShe is probably the most influential figure other than Maduro,\u201d Fernando Cutz, a senior White House adviser on Latin America during Trump\u2019s first year in office, told Reuters.\nEarlier this year, according to people with knowledge of her efforts, Flores personally pressed crucial opposition lawmakers to support a Maduro ally to head the National Assembly, until then considered the last independent government institution in the country.\nAs Reuters reported in March, people familiar with lobbying of the lawmakers say ruling party operatives paid bribes to rivals who switched sides. Reuters couldn\u2019t determine whether Flores played any role in such payments.\nLittle is known about the first lady outside Venezuela, particularly the extent of her role in Maduro\u2019s government and her dealings that help it survive.\nIn their first interrogation of Lamas after his arrest in Colombia, U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents had one request, he recalled: \u201cTell us about Cilia Flores,\u201d they said.\nMichael D. Miller, a DEA spokesman, referred questions regarding the case to the Justice Department.\nLamas, now 40, spent over a decade guarding Flores \u2013 first when she was a lawmaker and headed the National Assembly, later when she became first lady. After his extradition in 2017, Lamas agreed to a plea deal with U.S. prosecutors, according to a confidential Justice Department document reviewed by Reuters.\nThe agreement hasn\u2019t been previously reported.\nIn the plea deal, Lamas admitted to charges of drug trafficking and agreed to cooperate as a witness in investigations related to his case. The Colombian court order that approved his extradition, also reviewed by Reuters, said Lamas conspired to ship cocaine from Venezuela on U.S.-registered aircraft.\nNeither the Colombian court order nor the Justice Department document mention Flores, Maduro or others in the family.\nBecause of the terms of the plea agreement \u2013 he said he is still awaiting sentencing and continues to testify in related investigations \u2013 Lamas declined to discuss specifics about the case against him. His lawyer in Washington, Carmen Hernandez, also declined to comment.\nThe information he is providing investigators, including details on Flores\u2019 alleged role in the drug-trafficking plan by her nephews, is deemed credible by U.S. authorities, according to people familiar with the probes. Mike Vigil, a former DEA chief of international operations, told Reuters the DEA gives \u201chigh significance\u201d to Lamas\u2019 testimony.\n\u201cREVOLUTIONARY CALLING\u201d\nFlores was born October 15, 1956, in Tinaquillo, a small city in northwestern Venezuela. The youngest of six siblings, she lived in a mud-brick shack with a dirt floor, locals recall. Her father was a salesman, traveling to nearby towns to hawk sundry goods. While still a child, she and her family moved to Caracas, Venezuela\u2019s capital.\nA good pupil, Flores enrolled in a private university and studied criminal law. There, she met Maikel Moreno, a lifelong friend and a lawyer she would eventually help become Venezuela\u2019s chief justice. Moreno, a Maduro ally and a controversial figure in his own right, was one of those indicted by Washington last March.\nMoreno didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment; in a tweet, he denounced Washington for trying to \u201chijack Venezuelan justice.\u201d\nAs a student, Flores showed little interest in politics, according to people who knew her. She worked part-time at a police station, transcribing statements from witnesses, and married a longtime boyfriend, a police detective, with whom she had three boys. Upon earning her law degree, she worked for most of the next decade as a defense attorney for a private firm.\nIn 1989, a fuel hike sparked riots that shook Caracas and awakened in Flores what she later described to state television as a \u201crevolutionary calling.\u201d Hundreds of protesters, angry with corruption and widening inequality in the oil-producing country, died in clashes with security forces.\nThe event, known as the Caracazo \u2013 roughly, the big Caracas awakening \u2013 also inspired Chavez. As inflation, food shortages and other hardships worsened, Chavez, an Army lieutenant colonel, in 1992 staged a failed coup. He was arrested and jailed at a military barracks.\nFlores discovered a hero. She took to spraypainting Chavez\u2019s name around Caracas. \u201cI saw him in that moment as I would in the 20 years I spent near him,\u201d she later told state television. \u201cAuthentic.\u201d\nSlideshow ( 7 images )\nShe sent Chavez a letter offering to aid his defense. He accepted. Soon she was counseling Chavez and helping him answer letters from thousands of supporters.\nOn one early visit, she met a Caracas union leader who was also advising Chavez: Maduro. In a televised speech years later, Maduro said he was drawn to her \u201cfiery character.\u201d He began to wink at her, he said.\nAs it happened, both were divorcing their spouses. They began dating and eventually became a couple. \u201cWe shared the same dreams,\u201d Flores later told state television.\nIn 1994, Chavez received a presidential pardon. Flores and other advisors suggested he reinvent himself as a civilian and rally support with promises to empower the poor. By 1997, Flores was part of the campaign committee that would secure Chavez\u2019s election the next year as president. Maduro was elected as a legislator.\nNot much of a gladhander herself, Flores nonetheless won a seat in the National Assembly in 2000. \u201cShe\u2019s not a leader to hold a political rally,\u201d said Juan Barreto, a former Caracas mayor and media director for Chavez. \u201cBut don\u2019t think she doesn\u2019t have a voice behind closed doors.\u201d\nIn the legislature, Flores earned a combative reputation.\nWhen fellow Chavistas elected her leader of the National Assembly in 2007, she publicly referred to opposition lawmakers as \u201csinners,\u201d suggesting the government had the moral high ground over its rivals. She switched off their microphones when she felt they grew longwinded.\nShe also began using her position to help family members.\nFlores replaced about 50 support staff employed by the National Assembly with relatives and associates, the legislature\u2019s union said. Four siblings, two cousins and her ex-husband were among the hires, according to a list created by the union at the time of the shakeup and recently reviewed by Reuters.\nShe named her brother, a policeman, head of assembly security. A nephew \u2013 a cousin of her two nephews now jailed in the United States \u2013 was appointed as the legislature\u2019s administrative director.\nReuters was unable to reach Flores\u2019 siblings, her ex-husband, or other relatives mentioned in this story, including her children and her nephews.\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Flores was responsible for all the job changes the union complained about. But she has defiantly defended the appointments. \u201cI feel proud that they are my family,\u201d she told reporters at the time. \u201cI will defend them as workers in the assembly.\u201d\nWhen union leaders complained about nepotism, Flores summoned them to her office, recalls Jose Rivero, who attended some of those meetings and is now the union boss. \u201cLeave this issue alone,\u201d he says she told them. The union complied.\nIn 2012, Chavez named Flores attorney general. She held the post until March 2013, when Chavez died. Voters elected Maduro, by then vice president, to succeed him. Maduro and Flores, not officially married, tied the knot that July.\nAs first lady, Flores initially made her presence known in small ways. She ordered new furniture, curtains and a repainting of the Miraflores Palace, former aides said. Soon, she began playing a far more substantial role.\nIn 2014, oil prices plunged, pulling Venezuela into depression. As discontent grew, Flores began to see threats within the government. In October, Maduro fired Miguel Rodriguez, his interior minister, and replaced him with a Flores ally.\nThree people familiar with the decision said that Flores believed Rodriguez, a charismatic general popular with troops, was eclipsing Maduro. People close to Rodriguez said he had indeed aspired to higher office.\nAfter his ouster, Rodriguez formed a rival political party and publicly denounced Maduro. Intelligence agents later arrested Rodriguez on conspiracy charges, which he denied. He remains imprisoned. Juan Luis Sosa, an attorney for Rodriguez, declined to comment.\n\u201cCilia likes or hates you,\u201d one former Maduro aide says. \u201cShe\u2019s not a dealmaker, she\u2019s a hardliner.\u201d\n\u201cCILIA KNEW EVERYTHING\u201d\nLamas, the bodyguard, began working for Flores in her days as a legislator. From a post in the National Guard, he had been assigned to Chavez\u2019s security detail and later transferred to guard Flores, he said. A photo on Lamas\u2019 Twitter feed shows him, in a revolutionary red baseball cap, with Flores at a Socialist party event in 2010.\nWith the job came proximity to the Flores family.\nThe first lady entrusted him with driving her aging mother for medical checkups, Lamas said. He became close to Flores\u2019 sons \u2013 Walter, Yoswal and Yosser. \u201cI considered them my brothers,\u201d he said, recalling trips to shoot rifles and to opulent family properties on the Caribbean coast.\nThe brothers \u2013 known as \u201cLos Chamos,\u201d or \u201cthe boys\u201d \u2013 have attracted media attention in Venezuela for their flashy lifestyles.\nLamas said he saw them use government jets to travel abroad for fun. He also said he saw them several times late at night load military jeeps with boxes of U.S. dollars and transport the cash from their homes in Caracas to other locations for storage.\nReuters couldn\u2019t independently verify that claim.\nFlores\u2019 sons haven\u2019t been indicted on any charges in the United States. They are on the U.S. Treasury\u2019s list of Venezuelans sanctioned for alleged corruption. The sanctions are meant to punish central figures in Maduro\u2019s government and block any assets they may have in the United States or within its jurisdiction.\nThe family\u2019s reach by this point was manifest at Petroleos de Venezuela SA, or PDVSA [PDVSA.UL], the national oil company and the government\u2019s cash cow. In 2014, PDVSA appointed a new finance director: Carlos Malpica, the third nephew of Flores, who previously managed the support staff at the National Assembly.\nMalpica couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.\nPeople close to Flores said Malpica had become the first lady\u2019s most trusted relative, especially when it came to financial matters. Documents compiled by U.S. investigators for their case against the other two Flores nephews provide insight into Malpica\u2019s influence.\nIn August 2015, according to text messages gathered by the investigators and transcribed in documents used at the trial, Efrain Campo, one of the two nephews, received a text from an acquaintance. The message asked for Campo\u2019s help in recouping money allegedly owed by PDVSA to the acquaintance. The origins of the debt are unclear.\nCampo told the acquaintance to call Malpica. At PDVSA, Campo wrote, Malpica was the \u201cmaximum authority there, since he\u2019s a Flores.\u201d \u201cHe will not do it for free,\u201d Campo added.\nPDVSA officials didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nMalpica left his PDVSA post in 2016, giving no explanation for his departure, and has since kept a low profile. The U.S. Treasury Department would later include him on its list of Venezuelans sanctioned for alleged corruption.\nThe jailed nephews, Campo and Franqui Flores, were close to the first lady. She helped raise both of them, two people who know the family told Reuters, and both men sometimes referred to her as \u201cmom.\u201d\nTheir November 2015 arrest, in a DEA sting in Haiti, made international headlines. In Venezuela, it earned the pair the nickname of the \u201cnarcosobrinos,\u201d or \u201cnarconephews.\u201d\nThe bust stemmed from a plan to sell $20 million worth of cocaine in the United States. The men, who pleaded not guilty, were convicted and sentenced to 18 years in prison. At the time, Flores told reporters that her nephews had been victims of a DEA \u201ckidnapping.\u201d She has since said little publicly about the case.\nAmong evidence investigators obtained, according to two people familiar with the case, are text messages between the nephews and Flores in which the trio allegedly discuss the cocaine shipment.\nThe messages, which haven\u2019t been seen by Reuters, are among documentation compiled by prosecutors from the U.S. investigation of the nephews. The people familiar with the messages said they make clear that Flores helped coordinate logistics of the cocaine shipment with them.\nThe proceeds from the coke deal were meant to finance a Flores campaign for the National Assembly in 2015, according to the U.S. indictment against Maduro. The people familiar with the text messages said the nephews told Flores in the texts that the cocaine money would be for her campaign.\nFlores had briefly left the assembly when she became attorney general, and in 2015 she was reelected.\nA recording made by a DEA informant captured the two nephews discussing the planned deal, according to a transcript submitted as evidence in their trial.\nIn the recording, Campo says his \u201cmom\u201d is planning to run again for the assembly. People familiar with the probe believe \u201cmom,\u201d given the context of the discussion, meant Flores.\nBecause of the burgeoning economic crisis and growing discontent at the time, Campo told the informant, \u201cthere is a risk we could lose, so she\u2019s getting in there again.\u201d\n\u201cWe need the money,\u201d Campo added, in a remark investigators interpreted as an allusion to the impact of economic sanctions on Socialist coffers. \u201cThe Americans are hitting us hard, and the opposition is getting a lot of help.\u201d\nBefore the two nephews were arrested, Lamas said he saw the two men on several occasions send cocaine shipments on planes from the presidential hangar outside Caracas. Reuters couldn\u2019t verify whether Flores knew of the alleged shipments.\nAt times, Lamas said, Flores would hear relatives discuss illicit activities, including her nephews talking about the drug transaction for which they were convicted. She would shake her head, he added, but not voice disapproval.\n\u201cCilia knew everything,\u201d Lamas says.\nA GRAND BARGAIN\nIn Caracas, where political intrigue abounds, Flores has covered Maduro\u2019s flanks. Early last year, Juan Guaid\u00f3, head of the National Assembly, declared Maduro\u2019s 2018 re-election a fraud and said he was the rightful president of Venezuela. He urged the military to oust Maduro.\nFlores quickly sought out signs of disloyalty within government ranks. Figuera, the former intelligence chief, told Reuters she ordered all documentation his agents collected about any additional dissent, including transcripts of phone taps of opposition politicians, sent directly to her. He complied.\nIn March 2019, a nationwide electricity blackout darkened Venezuela. As senior officials convened to discuss the problem, one minister showed Twitter posts by Luis Carlos Diaz, a prominent journalist, blaming the government.\nFlores said Diaz \u201cshould be jailed,\u201d Figuera told Reuters. Maduro afterwards ordered him to arrest the journalist, Figuera added.\nAs Diaz bicycled home on March 11, Figuera\u2019s agents arrested him, raided his home and seized computers and phones. After an uproar, Figuera said, Maduro called him the following day to order Diaz\u2019s release. Diaz, who was let out, remains free and is working as a journalist. He declined to comment.\nBy April of last year, as most Western democracies backed Guaid\u00f3, Figuera and a handful of other senior officials began considering a negotiated exit for Maduro. They weighed the possibility of arranging safe passage for Maduro to Cuba or another allied country, Figuera said, in exchange for the easing of U.S. sanctions or other compromises by Washington.\nAmong the officials who discussed the idea was Moreno, the chief justice and longtime Flores friend, according to Figuera and two other people familiar with the talks. As the group prepared to discuss the possibility with U.S. envoys, Moreno told Figuera they should press for further concessions, including the release of Flores\u2019 two nephews.\nThe suggestion of seeking the nephews\u2019 freedom as part of a grand bargain with Washington followed attempts months earlier by Flores intermediaries to secure their release.\nAccording to the people familiar with those earlier discussions, Flores had intermediaries tell Washington early last year that Caracas, in exchange for the nephews, would free the six Citgo executives. Venezuela had charged the executives, who remain in prison awaiting trial, with embezzlement related to renegotiation of Citgo\u2019s debt with various lenders.\nAttorneys for the executives told Reuters the charges are baseless and that they were unaware of any effort to include their clients in any prisoner swap. Jesus Loreto, a Caracas lawyer representing Tomeu Vadell, one of the six, said such an offer \u201cwould be yet more evidence of the arbitrary nature\u201d of the arrests.\nA senior Trump administration official told Reuters the swap offer was a \u201cnon-starter.\u201d\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t like a spy exchange with Russia,\u201d said another American familiar with the discussions. \u201cThe nephews are convicted criminals.\u201d\nReuters couldn\u2019t determine whether Flores was aware of Moreno\u2019s attempts to broker a departure for Maduro. Moreno ultimately backed out of the talks, according to Figuera and the two other people. The effort fizzled and Figuera defected. He now lives in Miami. Moreno remains chief justice of Venezuela.\nLate last year, Flores spearheaded the effort to swing opposition legislators toward a Maduro ally as assembly head. On December 7, Flores and several Maduro aides met with a group of opposition lawmakers at the Fuerte Tiuna military base in Caracas, people with knowledge of the meeting said. There, Flores urged the lawmakers to back the Maduro candidate.\nSeveral lawmakers, including at least one who attended that meeting, later accepted payments of up to $150,000 to vote for Maduro\u2019s candidate, these people said. Reuters couldn\u2019t determine if Flores or Maduro were aware of the payments or whether they were discussed at the military base.\nIn January, Luis Parra, the government candidate, won the election for assembly chief. Now, Guaid\u00f3 and Parra both claim to be running the assembly. Parra\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nFrom his cell in Washington, Lamas reads about politics back home. He is studying English and working as a prison cook. He showed Reuters a certificate from the prison commending his \u201coutstanding contribution to the culinary department.\u201d\nLamas now seethes against the family he once worked to protect. He is particularly aggrieved by a raid on his house in the days after his arrest, and a long interrogation of his wife, with whom he has two small children. A neighbor confirmed seeing the raid take place.\n\u201cI was loyal to them,\u201d Lamas says. \u201cBut they weren\u2019t loyal to me.\u201d\nEditing by Paulo Prada\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"url": "/article/idUSL1N2D82P6", "headline": "SPECIAL REPORT-U.S. takes aim at the power behind Venezuela's Maduro: his first lady", "published_date": "2020-05-27", "text": "By Angus Berwick, Matt Spetalnick\n25 MIN READ\nCARACAS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Four years ago, a bit player in the Venezuelan leadership was arrested in Colombia and extradited to the United States to face drug charges. He proved to be an important catch.\nFILE PHOTO: Cilia Flores (C), deputy of Venezuela's United Socialist Party (PSUV) and wife of Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro, and her fellow deputy Diosdado Cabello (R) attend a session of the National Assembly in Caracas January 22, 2016. REUTERS/Marco Bello/File Photo\nThe man, Yazenky Lamas, worked as a bodyguard for the person widely considered the power behind President Nicolas Maduro\u2019s throne: first lady Cilia Flores.\nNow, with help from Lamas\u2019 testimony, the United States is preparing to charge Flores in coming months with crimes that could include drug trafficking and corruption, four people familiar with the investigation of the first lady told Reuters.\nIf Washington goes ahead with an indictment, these people said, the charges are likely to stem, at least in part, from a thwarted cocaine transaction that has already landed two of Flores\u2019 nephews in a Florida penitentiary.\nNicole Navas, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Justice, declined to comment on any possible charges against Flores. Flores and her office at the National Assembly didn\u2019t respond to questions for this article.\nJorge Rodriguez, Venezuela\u2019s information minister, told Reuters in a text message that its questions about the possible U.S. indictment of Flores were \u201cnauseating, slanderous and offensive.\u201d He didn\u2019t elaborate.\nIn a series of interviews with Reuters, the first Lamas has given since his arrest, the former bodyguard said Flores was aware of the coke-trafficking racket for which her two nephews were convicted by a U.S. court. Flores also used her privileged position, he said, to reward family members with prominent and well-paid positions in government, a claim of nepotism backed by others interviewed for this article.\nSpeaking behind reinforced glass at the prison in Washington, D.C., where he is detained, Lamas told Reuters he is speaking out against Flores because he feels abandoned by the Maduro administration, still ensconced in power even though many of its central figures, including the president, have also been accused of crimes. \u201cI feel betrayed by them,\u201d he told Reuters.\nIn late March, U.S. prosecutors indicted Maduro and over a dozen current and former Venezuelan officials on charges of narco-terrorism and drug smuggling. Maduro, now in his eighth year as Venezuela\u2019s president, for years sought to flood the U.S. with cocaine, prosecutors alleged, seeking to weaken American society and bolster his position and wealth.\nMaduro\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. In a televised speech after the indictments, he dismissed the charges against him and his colleagues as a politically motivated fabrication by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump. \u201cYou are a miserable person, Donald Trump,\u201d he said.\nThe March indictments and the possible charges against Flores come amid a fresh campaign by Washington to increase pressure on Maduro. His enduring grip on power, some U.S. officials say, is a source of frustration for Trump.\nStarting in 2017, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned the Socialist leader along with his wife and other members of the Maduro \u201cinner circle.\u201d The swipe at Flores enraged Maduro. \u201cIf you want to attack me, attack me,\u201d he said in a televised speech at the time. \u201cBut don\u2019t mess with Cilia, don\u2019t mess with the family.\u201d\nLeveraging the economic fallout from the coronavirus crisis in Venezuela, the White House now hopes it can topple a leader who has weathered years of tightening economic sanctions, civil unrest and international isolation.\nWashington has accused Maduro and his circle of looting Venezuela of billions of dollars. But it\u2019s unclear how much personal wealth he and Flores possess. Neither the president nor the first lady disclose income statements, tax returns or other documents pertaining to their personal finances.\nAfter U.S. prosecutors charged Maduro, the Justice Department said it had seized more than $1 billion in assets belonging to dozens of defendants connected to the case. The charges didn\u2019t detail those assets or specify who holds them.\nFlores is a longtime strategist and kingmaker in the ruling Socialist party. She first gained prominence as a lawmaker and confidante of the late Hugo Chavez, Maduro\u2019s predecessor and mentor. She doesn\u2019t hold an official role in Maduro\u2019s cabinet.\nStill, the probe against her underscores the vast influence she wields, particularly in helping Maduro outmaneuver rivals inside and outside Venezuela.\nIn addition to Lamas, Reuters interviewed more than 20 people close to and familiar with Flores. They portray her as a shrewd and stealthy politician who now brandishes much of the power of her husband\u2019s office, demanding important briefings even before the president and personally negotiating with foreign emissaries, rival lawmakers and others.\nWhen the opposition-led National Assembly tried to oust Maduro last year, Flores ordered security officials to deliver intelligence on the matter directly to her, according to Manuel Cristopher Figuera, the head of the country\u2019s intelligence agency then.\nFiguera was one of a handful of senior Venezuelan officials who at the time considered trying to negotiate an exit from power by Maduro with the United States. Figuera fled Venezuela when the effort failed.\n\u201cFlores has always been behind the curtain, pulling the strings,\u201d Figuera told Reuters.\nFlores has sought personal concessions in recent years in negotiations with the United States.\nAccording to five people familiar with the discussions, Flores instructed intermediaries to ask U.S. envoys for liberty for her jailed nephews. In exchange, these intermediaries said Venezuela would release six imprisoned executives of Citgo Petroleum Corp [PDVSAC.UL], the U.S. refining unit of Venezuela\u2019s state-run oil company.\nThe executives, arrested by Venezuela in 2017 and charged with embezzlement, are widely considered by human rights activists and many in the business community to be political prisoners.\nThat overture, reported here for the first time, failed.\nBut Washington knows Flores\u2019 clout. \u201cShe is probably the most influential figure other than Maduro,\u201d Fernando Cutz, a senior White House adviser on Latin America during Trump\u2019s first year in office, told Reuters.\nEarlier this year, according to people with knowledge of her efforts, Flores personally pressed crucial opposition lawmakers to support a Maduro ally to head the National Assembly, until then considered the last independent government institution in the country.\nAs Reuters reported in March, people familiar with lobbying of the lawmakers say ruling party operatives paid bribes to rivals who switched sides. Reuters couldn\u2019t determine whether Flores played any role in such payments.\nLittle is known about the first lady outside Venezuela, particularly the extent of her role in Maduro\u2019s government and her dealings that help it survive.\nIn their first interrogation of Lamas after his arrest in Colombia, U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents had one request, he recalled: \u201cTell us about Cilia Flores,\u201d they said.\nMichael D. Miller, a DEA spokesman, referred questions regarding the case to the Justice Department.\nLamas, now 40, spent over a decade guarding Flores \u2013 first when she was a lawmaker and headed the National Assembly, later when she became first lady. After his extradition in 2017, Lamas agreed to a plea deal with U.S. prosecutors, according to a confidential Justice Department document reviewed by Reuters.\nThe agreement hasn\u2019t been previously reported.\nIn the plea deal, Lamas admitted to charges of drug trafficking and agreed to cooperate as a witness in investigations related to his case. The Colombian court order that approved his extradition, also reviewed by Reuters, said Lamas conspired to ship cocaine from Venezuela on U.S.-registered aircraft.\nNeither the Colombian court order nor the Justice Department document mention Flores, Maduro or others in the family.\nBecause of the terms of the plea agreement \u2013 he said he is still awaiting sentencing and continues to testify in related investigations \u2013 Lamas declined to discuss specifics about the case against him. His lawyer in Washington, Carmen Hernandez, also declined to comment.\nThe information he is providing investigators, including details on Flores\u2019 alleged role in the drug-trafficking plan by her nephews, is deemed credible by U.S. authorities, according to people familiar with the probes. Mike Vigil, a former DEA chief of international operations, told Reuters the DEA gives \u201chigh significance\u201d to Lamas\u2019 testimony.\n\u201cREVOLUTIONARY CALLING\u201d\nFlores was born October 15, 1956, in Tinaquillo, a small city in northwestern Venezuela. The youngest of six siblings, she lived in a mud-brick shack with a dirt floor, locals recall. Her father was a salesman, traveling to nearby towns to hawk sundry goods. While still a child, she and her family moved to Caracas, Venezuela\u2019s capital.\nA good pupil, Flores enrolled in a private university and studied criminal law. There, she met Maikel Moreno, a lifelong friend and a lawyer she would eventually help become Venezuela\u2019s chief justice. Moreno, a Maduro ally and a controversial figure in his own right, was one of those indicted by Washington last March.\nMoreno didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment; in a tweet, he denounced Washington for trying to \u201chijack Venezuelan justice.\u201d\nAs a student, Flores showed little interest in politics, according to people who knew her. She worked part-time at a police station, transcribing statements from witnesses, and married a longtime boyfriend, a police detective, with whom she had three boys. Upon earning her law degree, she worked for most of the next decade as a defense attorney for a private firm.\nIn 1989, a fuel hike sparked riots that shook Caracas and awakened in Flores what she later described to state television as a \u201crevolutionary calling.\u201d Hundreds of protesters, angry with corruption and widening inequality in the oil-producing country, died in clashes with security forces.\nThe event, known as the Caracazo \u2013 roughly, the big Caracas awakening \u2013 also inspired Chavez. As inflation, food shortages and other hardships worsened, Chavez, an Army lieutenant colonel, in 1992 staged a failed coup. He was arrested and jailed at a military barracks.\nFlores discovered a hero. She took to spraypainting Chavez\u2019s name around Caracas. \u201cI saw him in that moment as I would in the 20 years I spent near him,\u201d she later told state television. \u201cAuthentic.\u201d\nSlideshow ( 7 images )\nShe sent Chavez a letter offering to aid his defense. He accepted. Soon she was counseling Chavez and helping him answer letters from thousands of supporters.\nOn one early visit, she met a Caracas union leader who was also advising Chavez: Maduro. In a televised speech years later, Maduro said he was drawn to her \u201cfiery character.\u201d He began to wink at her, he said.\nAs it happened, both were divorcing their spouses. They began dating and eventually became a couple. \u201cWe shared the same dreams,\u201d Flores later told state television.\nIn 1994, Chavez received a presidential pardon. Flores and other advisors suggested he reinvent himself as a civilian and rally support with promises to empower the poor. By 1997, Flores was part of the campaign committee that would secure Chavez\u2019s election the next year as president. Maduro was elected as a legislator.\nNot much of a gladhander herself, Flores nonetheless won a seat in the National Assembly in 2000. \u201cShe\u2019s not a leader to hold a political rally,\u201d said Juan Barreto, a former Caracas mayor and media director for Chavez. \u201cBut don\u2019t think she doesn\u2019t have a voice behind closed doors.\u201d\nIn the legislature, Flores earned a combative reputation.\nWhen fellow Chavistas elected her leader of the National Assembly in 2007, she publicly referred to opposition lawmakers as \u201csinners,\u201d suggesting the government had the moral high ground over its rivals. She switched off their microphones when she felt they grew longwinded.\nShe also began using her position to help family members.\nFlores replaced about 50 support staff employed by the National Assembly with relatives and associates, the legislature\u2019s union said. Four siblings, two cousins and her ex-husband were among the hires, according to a list created by the union at the time of the shakeup and recently reviewed by Reuters.\nShe named her brother, a policeman, head of assembly security. A nephew \u2013 a cousin of her two nephews now jailed in the United States \u2013 was appointed as the legislature\u2019s administrative director.\nReuters was unable to reach Flores\u2019 siblings, her ex-husband, or other relatives mentioned in this story, including her children and her nephews.\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Flores was responsible for all the job changes the union complained about. But she has defiantly defended the appointments. \u201cI feel proud that they are my family,\u201d she told reporters at the time. \u201cI will defend them as workers in the assembly.\u201d\nWhen union leaders complained about nepotism, Flores summoned them to her office, recalls Jose Rivero, who attended some of those meetings and is now the union boss. \u201cLeave this issue alone,\u201d he says she told them. The union complied.\nIn 2012, Chavez named Flores attorney general. She held the post until March 2013, when Chavez died. Voters elected Maduro, by then vice president, to succeed him. Maduro and Flores, not officially married, tied the knot that July.\nAs first lady, Flores initially made her presence known in small ways. She ordered new furniture, curtains and a repainting of the Miraflores Palace, former aides said. Soon, she began playing a far more substantial role.\nIn 2014, oil prices plunged, pulling Venezuela into depression. As discontent grew, Flores began to see threats within the government. In October, Maduro fired Miguel Rodriguez, his interior minister, and replaced him with a Flores ally.\nThree people familiar with the decision said that Flores believed Rodriguez, a charismatic general popular with troops, was eclipsing Maduro. People close to Rodriguez said he had indeed aspired to higher office.\nAfter his ouster, Rodriguez formed a rival political party and publicly denounced Maduro. Intelligence agents later arrested Rodriguez on conspiracy charges, which he denied. He remains imprisoned. Juan Luis Sosa, an attorney for Rodriguez, declined to comment.\n\u201cCilia likes or hates you,\u201d one former Maduro aide says. \u201cShe\u2019s not a dealmaker, she\u2019s a hardliner.\u201d\n\u201cCILIA KNEW EVERYTHING\u201d\nLamas, the bodyguard, began working for Flores in her days as a legislator. From a post in the National Guard, he had been assigned to Chavez\u2019s security detail and later transferred to guard Flores, he said. A photo on Lamas\u2019 Twitter feed shows him, in a revolutionary red baseball cap, with Flores at a Socialist party event in 2010.\nWith the job came proximity to the Flores family.\nThe first lady entrusted him with driving her aging mother for medical checkups, Lamas said. He became close to Flores\u2019 sons \u2013 Walter, Yoswal and Yosser. \u201cI considered them my brothers,\u201d he said, recalling trips to shoot rifles and to opulent family properties on the Caribbean coast.\nThe brothers \u2013 known as \u201cLos Chamos,\u201d or \u201cthe boys\u201d \u2013 have attracted media attention in Venezuela for their flashy lifestyles.\nLamas said he saw them use government jets to travel abroad for fun. He also said he saw them several times late at night load military jeeps with boxes of U.S. dollars and transport the cash from their homes in Caracas to other locations for storage.\nReuters couldn\u2019t independently verify that claim.\nFlores\u2019 sons haven\u2019t been indicted on any charges in the United States. They are on the U.S. Treasury\u2019s list of Venezuelans sanctioned for alleged corruption. The sanctions are meant to punish central figures in Maduro\u2019s government and block any assets they may have in the United States or within its jurisdiction.\nThe family\u2019s reach by this point was manifest at Petroleos de Venezuela SA, or PDVSA [PDVSA.UL], the national oil company and the government\u2019s cash cow. In 2014, PDVSA appointed a new finance director: Carlos Malpica, the third nephew of Flores, who previously managed the support staff at the National Assembly.\nMalpica couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.\nPeople close to Flores said Malpica had become the first lady\u2019s most trusted relative, especially when it came to financial matters. Documents compiled by U.S. investigators for their case against the other two Flores nephews provide insight into Malpica\u2019s influence.\nIn August 2015, according to text messages gathered by the investigators and transcribed in documents used at the trial, Efrain Campo, one of the two nephews, received a text from an acquaintance. The message asked for Campo\u2019s help in recouping money allegedly owed by PDVSA to the acquaintance. The origins of the debt are unclear.\nCampo told the acquaintance to call Malpica. At PDVSA, Campo wrote, Malpica was the \u201cmaximum authority there, since he\u2019s a Flores.\u201d \u201cHe will not do it for free,\u201d Campo added.\nPDVSA officials didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nMalpica left his PDVSA post in 2016, giving no explanation for his departure, and has since kept a low profile. The U.S. Treasury Department would later include him on its list of Venezuelans sanctioned for alleged corruption.\nThe jailed nephews, Campo and Franqui Flores, were close to the first lady. She helped raise both of them, two people who know the family told Reuters, and both men sometimes referred to her as \u201cmom.\u201d\nTheir November 2015 arrest, in a DEA sting in Haiti, made international headlines. In Venezuela, it earned the pair the nickname of the \u201cnarcosobrinos,\u201d or \u201cnarconephews.\u201d\nThe bust stemmed from a plan to sell $20 million worth of cocaine in the United States. The men, who pleaded not guilty, were convicted and sentenced to 18 years in prison. At the time, Flores told reporters that her nephews had been victims of a DEA \u201ckidnapping.\u201d She has since said little publicly about the case.\nAmong evidence investigators obtained, according to two people familiar with the case, are text messages between the nephews and Flores in which the trio allegedly discuss the cocaine shipment.\nThe messages, which haven\u2019t been seen by Reuters, are among documentation compiled by prosecutors from the U.S. investigation of the nephews. The people familiar with the messages said they make clear that Flores helped coordinate logistics of the cocaine shipment with them.\nThe proceeds from the coke deal were meant to finance a Flores campaign for the National Assembly in 2015, according to the U.S. indictment against Maduro.

People familiar with the probe believe \u201cmom,\u201d given the context of the discussion, meant Flores.\nBecause of the burgeoning economic crisis and growing discontent at the time, Campo told the informant, \u201cthere is a risk we could lose, so she\u2019s getting in there again.\u201d\n\u201cWe need the money,\u201d Campo added, in a remark investigators interpreted as an allusion to the impact of economic sanctions on Socialist coffers. \u201cThe Americans are hitting us hard, and the opposition is getting a lot of help.\u201d\nBefore the two nephews were arrested, Lamas said he saw the two men on several occasions send cocaine shipments on planes from the presidential hangar outside Caracas. Reuters couldn\u2019t verify whether Flores knew of the alleged shipments.\nAt times, Lamas said, Flores would hear relatives discuss illicit activities, including her nephews talking about the drug transaction for which they were convicted.

REUTERS/Adriano Machado/File Photo\nThe Health Ministry mandated that cruises be canceled. It advised local authorities to scrap large-scale events. And it urged travelers arriving from abroad to go into isolation for a week. Although Brazil had yet to report a single death from COVID-19, public health officials appeared to be getting out in front of the virus. They acted on March 13, just two days after the World Health Organization called the disease a pandemic.\nLess than 24 hours later, the ministry watered down its own advice, citing \u201ccriticism and suggestions\u201d it had received from local communities.\nIn fact, four people familiar with the incident told Reuters, the change came after intervention from the chief of staff\u2019s office for Brazil\u2019s President Jair Bolsonaro.\n\u201cThat correction was due to pressure,\u201d said Julio Croda, an epidemiologist who was then the head of the Health Ministry\u2019s department of immunization and transmissible diseases. The intervention by the chief of staff\u2019s office has not been previously reported.\nThe about-face, given scant attention at the time, marked a turning point in the federal government\u2019s handling of the crisis, according to the four people. Behind the scenes, they said, power was shifting from the Health Ministry, the traditional leader on public health matters, to the office of the president\u2019s chief of staff, known as Casa Civil, led by Walter Souza Braga Netto, an Army general.\nBrazil has lost two health ministers in the past six weeks - one was fired, the other resigned - after they disagreed publicly with Bolsonaro over how best to combat the virus. The interim leader now in charge of the Health Ministry is another Army general.\nMore importantly, the revisions underlined the hardening of Bolsonaro\u2019s view that keeping Brazil\u2019s economy running was paramount, the people said. Bolsonaro, a far-right former Army captain, has never wavered on that stance formulated during a crucial few days in mid-March, despite domestic and international criticism of his handling of the crisis, and a snowballing death toll.\nBrazil now has the world\u2019s second-worst outbreak behind the United States, with more than 374,000 confirmed cases. More than 23,000 Brazilians have died from COVID-19.\n\u201cSo what?\u201d Bolsonaro said recently when asked by reporters about Brazil\u2019s mounting fatalities. \u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d\nCasa Civil said changes to the March 13 guidance were made by the Health Ministry, following input from states and municipalities.\nThe Health Ministry said there had been a divergence of views due to differing situations in states and cities nationwide. It said the implementation of physical distancing measures was the responsibility of local health authorities.\n\u201cThe strategy of the Brazilian response to COVID-19 was not impaired at any point,\u201d the ministry said.\nBolsonaro\u2019s office declined to comment for this story.\nReuters interviewed more than two dozen current and former government officials, medical experts, healthcare industry representatives and doctors to paint the most complete picture yet of Brazil\u2019s missteps in containing the coronavirus outbreak in South America\u2019s largest country.\nThey described a response that began promisingly, but which was soon hobbled by the president\u2019s clashes with Health Ministry and cabinet officials who could not persuade him that Brazil\u2019s economic fortunes ultimately hinged on how effectively it tackled its public health emergency.\nHealth experts were sidelined, the people said, and Bolsonaro embraced an unproven remedy to treat COVID-19 infections. Federal coordination foundered. State governors \u2013 some of whom Bolsonaro regards as re-election rivals \u2013 were left to set their own physical distancing policies and secure much of their own tests and equipment, the sources said.\nSome experts said Brazil\u2019s stumbles are all the more shocking because of its previous success containing malaria, Zika and HIV.\n\u201cOne thing that has been a shining light in Brazil has been their public health system,\u201d said Albert Ko, a professor at the Yale School of Public Health who has decades of experience in Brazil. \u201cTo see that all disintegrate so quickly, it\u2019s just been very sad.\u201d\n\u2018THE FRIDGE IS EMPTY\u2019\nWhen Brazil\u2019s first coronavirus case was confirmed on February 26, the Health Ministry had been preparing for nearly two months.\nIts personnel were running models to estimate when and how to implement stay-at-home orders in collaboration with state and local officials, sources said. The ministry was the command center for an emergency committee coordinating the federal response across multiple agencies.\nBrazil\u2019s vast size, underfunded public hospitals and widespread poverty were vulnerabilities. But the country boasts top medical scientists and a competent private healthcare sector. It had weeks of advance warning, as the virus hit countries like China and Italy first. Those on the frontline thought Brazil was in good shape to respond.\nBut the people who spoke with Reuters said things began to unravel along two main fronts: Bolsonaro\u2019s opposition to shutdown measures favored by the Health Ministry and the government\u2019s inability to scale up testing quickly.\nCabinet members tried numerous times to persuade Bolsonaro to endorse a nationwide lockdown, according to a person with direct knowledge of the discussions. Bolsonaro refused, the person said, believing the virus would soon pass and that health officials were exaggerating the need for physical distancing that had proved effective in other parts of the world.\n\u201cThe masses aren\u2019t able to stay at home because the fridge is empty,\u201d Bolsonaro said to the media on April 20 outside his official residence in Bras\u00edlia.\nBolsonaro\u2019s office declined to comment on why he prioritized the economy. He faced pressure to do so, however. Members of his conservative base have protested in cities across Brazil against lockdowns that threaten his promise to rekindle economic growth.\nYet Bolsonaro\u2019s economic advisors appeared slow to grasp the scale of the crisis. Economy Minister Paulo Guedes, a hardline free-market advocate, in mid-March told CNN Brasil that the nation\u2019s economy in 2020 could \u201creasonably grow 2% or 2.5% with the world falling\u201d because of coronavirus.\nThat prediction was far off the mark. Manufacturing activity has collapsed, unemployment is rising and Brazil\u2019s currency is down around 30% against the dollar this year. On May 15, Barclays cut its 2020 gross domestic product forecast for Brazil to -5.7% from -3.0%. It cited Brazil\u2019s \u201cineffective\u201d policy in dealing with the pandemic.\nThe Economy Ministry now projects GDP will contract by 4.7% this year. In an emailed statement, it said its forecasts have evolved in line with the gravity of the situation.\nGuedes declined a request to comment on his earlier prediction.\nA Guedes ally, Solange Vieira, who was involved in the government\u2019s landmark pension reform last year, likewise showed little urgency when presented with forecasts in mid-March from the Health Ministry, according to epidemiologist Croda. The ministry predicted widespread fatalities among Brazil\u2019s elderly if the virus wasn\u2019t contained.\n\u201c\u2018It\u2019s good that deaths are concentrated among the old,\u201d Croda recalled Vieira saying. \u201c\u2018That will improve our economic performance as it will reduce our pension deficit.\u2019\u201d\nSlideshow ( 7 images )\nCroda\u2019s account was backed by another official, speaking on condition of anonymity, who was told what happened but was not in attendance.\nVieira did not respond to a message on LinkedIn. The Superintendence of Private Insurance, which she leads, said in response to questions about her comments that she attended the mid-March meeting at the invitation of then-Health Minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta to understand the ministry\u2019s projections.\nVieira observed the impacts of various scenarios \u201calways with a focus on the preservation of lives,\u201d it said in a statement.\nPRESSURE FROM ABOVE\nFor a few days in March, it looked like the fallout from a trip to Florida to meet U.S. President Donald Trump might have altered Bolsonaro\u2019s thinking on coronavirus.\nJust after returning from the visit, on March 12, Bolsonaro\u2019s press secretary tested positive for COVID-19. In the following days, nearly two dozen Brazilians who had made the trip would test positive, embarrassing the government and sparking fears that both Bolsonaro and Trump might have been infected.\nAfter undergoing a coronavirus test on March 12, Bolsonaro called on his supporters to suspend nationwide rallies planned for March 15 for fear of worsening the spread. The following day, he said his test came back negative. The Health Ministry, meanwhile, announced its initial social distancing recommendations at a press conference in the capital.\nThen things changed.\nShortly after the new guidelines were issued on March 13, Croda said he got a call from his former boss, Health Surveillance Secretary Wanderson Oliveira, who said he was \u201cunder lots of pressure from Casa Civil and had to change the communique\u201d published by the ministry outlining the measures. Croda said Oliveira did not say specifically who at Casa Civil had demanded the guidelines be weakened.\nWithin 24 hours, the ministry had changed the recommendations on its website. It removed guidance on self-quarantines for travelers and the cancellation of cruises, saying those measures were up \u201cfor review.\u201d And it revised the cancellation of large events to apply only to areas with local transmission.\nOliveira did not respond to requests for comment. He recently left the Health Ministry.\nOn March 15, Bolsonaro ignored his own pronouncement from three days earlier discouraging mass rallies by his supporters. He met with a friendly crowd of demonstrators outside the presidential palace. Wearing the Brazil national soccer jersey, the president bumped fists and posed for selfies.\n\u201cIt was the first time we saw that totally different stance,\u201d then-Health Minister Mandetta told Reuters.\nThe next day, on March 16, Bolsonaro formalized the shift of power away from the Health Ministry, creating an inter-governmental \u201ccrisis cabinet\u201d led by Braga Netto, the Army general heading Casa Civil. Brazil registered its first coronavirus death on March 17.\nIn a response to Reuters\u2019 questions, Braga Netto\u2019s office said the group was formed because the pandemic \u201ctranscended\u201d public health.\nThree people familiar with the situation told Reuters the new cabinet effectively superseded the cross-agency group that had already been set up inside the Health Ministry. The big difference, they said, was that Braga Netto now had the final say, instead of public health experts, and that economic concerns were given more weight.\nThe Health Ministry said it would not comment on economic matters. It said the response to coronavirus cut across government departments.\nCroda left shortly after the creation of the new command center. He told Reuters he did not want to be held responsible for \u201cexcessive deaths.\u201d\nIn the weeks that followed, policy differences between Bolsonaro and Health Minister Mandetta broke out in the open. Mandetta continued to advocate for stay-at-home measures in defiance of the president. He also urged caution about the malaria drug chloroquine. Bolsonaro, following the lead of U.S. President Donald Trump, was increasingly promoting the drug as a possible cure for COVID-19 despite little evidence of its efficacy.\nMandetta\u2019s popularity added to the tension. An early-April survey by pollster Datafolha showed that the Health Ministry under his leadership had a 76% approval rating, more than twice that of Bolsonaro.\nOn April 16, after days of mounting speculation, Bolsonaro fired Mandetta. He replaced him with Nelson Teich, a respected oncologist and healthcare entrepreneur with no public health experience.\nTwo recently departed Health Ministry sources said the last half of April was lost while Teich \u201cfound his feet.\u201d Decisions on testing and new equipment were delayed, they said. More than 15 public health experts, including experienced epidemiologists, left with Mandetta, one of the sources said. Many were replaced by military personnel.\n\u201cThese changes greatly affect the capacity, speed, and the very quality of the response,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Tempor\u00e3o, a former health minister who led Brazil\u2019s crisis response to the 2009 swine flu epidemic. \u201cIt was a disastrous decision.\u201d\nThe Health Ministry denied that its response was hampered by the changes.\nOn May 15, Teich resigned after less than a month on the job. Bolsonaro had criticized him for being too timid in promoting the re-opening of Brazil\u2019s economy and the usage of chloroquine.\nTeich did not respond to a request for comment.\nIn a televised interview with GloboNews on Sunday, Teich said Bolsonaro\u2019s desire for a rapid expansion of the use of chloroquine in Brazil was what led him to quit.\nTeich\u2019s departure accelerated military influence within the Health Ministry. Eduardo Pazuello, an active-duty Army general with no medical background, is now interim health minister. Of the eight people at the top of the ministry, only one had a military background in March. Now three of them do. At least 13 military personnel also have been appointed to lower ministry positions.\nDays after Teich\u2019s departure, the ministry cleared the way for the widespread use of chloroquine to treat patients with mild cases of COVID-19.\nThe armed forces are widely respected in Brazil and often help with logistics during emergencies. But Wildo Araujo, a former Health Ministry official who co-authored one of the country\u2019s first major COVID-19 studies, said military personnel were being placed in unsuitable roles.\n\u201cI have the utmost respect for the armed forces, but I pity those entering now because they have no idea what to do,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know how to deal with the Brazilian public health system.\u201d\nBrazil\u2019s Army declined to comment, referring questions to the Health Ministry, which also declined to comment on the military\u2019s role.\nTESTING TIMES\nBolsonaro\u2019s opposition to social distancing and refusal to support local authorities in their attempts to impose lockdowns have helped erode compliance with those measures, experts said.\nA Reuters analysis of Google mobility data, which collates cell phone movement and compares it to a pre-pandemic benchmark, showed a far smaller reduction in people coming and going from transit hubs and places of work in Brazil than in European countries such as Italy, France and the United Kingdom where shelter-in-place measures have been effective.\nReuters also found Brazil\u2019s mobility reduction was less than that of other developing nations, for example Argentina, India and South Africa. Reuters analyzed data from 17 countries across Africa, Europe, Latin America and Asia for the month of April.\nLike other countries, including the United States, Brazil has also struggled to secure the tests it needs. That\u2019s a major failing, some epidemiologists say, which has made it harder to track and control the virus in Brazil.\nThe shortage of tests is due in part to the Health Ministry\u2019s over-reliance on one institution.\nAccording to an internal Health Ministry document viewed by Reuters, the ministry began purchasing diagnostic test kits through the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz), a respected public health institute, between January and February.\nBy April 7, however, Fiocruz had only delivered 104,872 - or 3.5% - of the roughly 3 million kits the ministry had ordered, the document said. Croda and others said Fiocruz struggled to acquire crucial reagents on the international market. Industry sources said years of budget cuts may also have been a factor.\nThe Health Ministry should have established a broad network of private and public labs, one source said, which would have improved the ability to procure reagents and process tests.\nIn a statement, Fiocruz said it had met all its obligations to the Health Ministry.\nIt said it surpassed an initial target of 220,000 tests by April 13 and delivered nearly 1.3 million tests by the last week of that month. It said it expects to deliver 11.7 million tests by September.\n\u201cThe worldwide competition for this type of test was very large,\u201d it said, \u201cwhich caused a shortage of products.\u201d\nBureaucracy also hamstrung Brazil. A batch of 500,000 antibody tests, used to determine who has had the virus, got stuck at S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s Guarulhos airport for 9 days as the health regulator processed an exception for them to be distributed without Portuguese labels, two people with knowledge of the situation told Reuters.\nThe Health Ministry declined to comment on the incident. It said it has increased testing capacity and will conduct 46.2 million tests, without specifying a time frame. \u201cThe initiative is part of efforts to find new purchases in the national and international market,\u201d it said.\nAs of May 12, however, Brazil had processed just 482,743 tests. Of the 10 countries with the highest COVID-19 death toll, only the Netherlands had tested fewer people than Brazil - a country with a twelfth of the population.\n($1 = 5.4548 reais)\nReporting by Gabriel Stargardter and Stephen Eisenhammer; additional reporting by Ricardo Brito, Pedro Fonseca, Marcela Ayres and Lisandra Paraguassu; Editing by Marla Dickerson\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"url": "/article/idUSL2N2CA18B", "headline": "As coronavirus 'storm cloud' gathers, black church in Missouri braces for mourning", "published_date": "2020-05-27", "text": "By Makini Brice\n5 MIN READ\n(Reuters) - When Traci Blackmon, the senior pastor for a predominantly black church in the suburbs of St. Louis, Missouri, is finally able to open the doors for service again, one of her main concerns is the collective sorrow her congregation will experience.\nPastor Traci Blackmon poses inside the closed Christ the King United Church of Christ, where five members of her 180-member congregation had gotten sick from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and two have died, in Florissant, Missouri, U.S. May 22, 2020.

Everyone needed to wear a mask.\n\u201cMy three kings and myself got to see him by ourselves, just the four of us, and we got to spend just a little while with him,\u201d she recalled. \u201cSo that was our time to say goodbye.\u201d\nChrist the King\u2019s congregation has been keeping in touch through the crisis through Zoom calls, Facebook livestreams of sermons given from Blackmon\u2019s dining room and Bible studies conducted over the phone, but it isn\u2019t exactly the same, members say.\nWesley Hurt, 77, and his wife Linda joined the Christ the King congregation more than 40 years ago, and have continued to attend services online during the lockdown.\n\u201cThe whole camaraderie thing is lost, to a certain extent. We are a church that likes to fix meals for each other and we do a lot of cooking. So we haven\u2019t had that opportunity to meet and come together and have our church dinners like we\u2019d normally have,\u201d Hurt said.\nThough Missouri allowed churches to reopen on May 4, Christ the King United Church of Christ remains closed. Blackmon said she remains cautious until she sees progress in a number of factors, including testing.\nBlackmon had initially planned to hold an Easter service when people were able to safely sit in the pews again, no matter the date.\nBut she worries now that the celebratory holiday would ring false for people grappling with all that had been lost from the pandemic.\nInstead, she is considering devoting the first service to Good Friday, the Christian holiday commemorating the death of Jesus.\n\u201cThere are a lot of things you can do over Zoom and there are a lot of things that you can do on different channels of the Internet, but what you cannot do is feel,\u201d she said.\nReporting by Makini Brice in Washington; Editing by Heather Timmons, Ed Tobin and Rosalba O\u2019Brien\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"url": "/article/idUSKBN23304V", "headline": "NHL restart plan makes dollars and sense", "published_date": "2020-05-26", "text": "By Reuters Staff\n5 MIN READ\nThere remain as many questions as answers as the NHL unveiled its return-to-play plan Tuesday, but give the league credit: Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, a road map is in place.\nSure, we don\u2019t know whether the league will actually resume action paused on March 12, but the hope that 24 teams will begin training camps sometime in July, play games in two hub cities and hand out the Stanley Cup is trying to make the best of a horrible situation.\nAlthough a second wave of the virus that has officially resulted in the death of approximately 350,000 people around the world could derail the NHL\u2019s plan, some hope of normalcy in our lives is welcome news.\nEven trying to decipher the draft-lottery system is a lot more fun than looking at the latest virus figures from Johns Hopkins University or being caught in the political vortex that\u2019s resulted from it all.\nAs the NHL optimistically looks to the future, here are five takeaways from the restart plan that catch our eye:\n1. It\u2019s OK to think about dollars and cents\nIt\u2019s easy to say the league wants to finish the season for no other reason than to collect as much sponsorship and television revenue as possible, but provided everyone is able to stay safe, that\u2019s not a bad thing. It is a business that impacts the economy.\nThe teams have paid players the bulk of their annual salaries, so it\u2019s fair for the owners to try recouping some money even without ticket sales and connected revenue from concessions, parking and souvenirs.\nHockey fans will happily tune in to the Stanley Cup sprint and be thankful for the distraction from all the negative we\u2019ve survived.\n2. It\u2019s no debate: The Cup champ will be legitimate\nIt\u2019s absurd to say whichever team hoists the Stanley Cup when the season ends should have an asterisk next to their crown. That\u2019s not the case with the New Jersey Devils\u2019 title from 1995, and it won\u2019t be this year, either.\nNo matter what happens, the champion must win at least four series to claim that honor. (Count the qualifying-round series in which 16 teams must play, and it could mean winning five rounds.)\nDon\u2019t think for a second that any team will be given a free pass. In fact, with the layoff allowing most players to be 100 percent healthy, some underdogs will be even stronger than they would have been had life been normal.\n3. Skewered in Buffalo\nThe poor Buffalo Sabres officially have missed the playoffs nine straight seasons, sidelined by the points-percentage format. Buffalo (.493 points percentage) was three points back of the Montreal Canadiens (.500) with two games in hand, but it won\u2019t get a chance to erase that gap.\nThe other six teams eliminated on Tuesday (the Detroit Red Wings, Ottawa Senators, New Jersey, San Jose Sharks, Los Angeles Kings and Anaheim Ducks) weren\u2019t even remotely close to a playoff position, so they happily avoid the indignity of playing out the string. (The Devils had the same points, 68, and games played, 69, as the Sabres but were buried in the bottom of the Metropolitan Division.)\nA saving grace for the downtrodden Sabres franchise would be a draft-lottery win, but not having a chance to skate in a playoff game is a tough consequence of an improvised system that never could be perfect.\n4. Missed opportunity to renew a great rivalry\nOther than the obvious of not being able to watch games live and in person, there aren\u2019t many negatives.\nHad the league gone straight into playoffs based on existing standings, though, the Edmonton Oilers and Calgary Flames would have renewed Battle of Alberta hostilities in the playoffs for the first time since 1991.\n(We also miss out on a Pennsylvania showdown between the Pittsburgh Penguins and Philadelphia Flyers, but they last met in the postseason two years ago, so it\u2019s not the same).\nIt\u2019s possible these rivalries will be fired up after the qualifying round, but there are no guarantees.\n5. Give the underdogs their due\nThe Columbus Blue Jackets were a bubble team when the games were halted. However, no team in the mix was as besieged by injuries as they were. Not far behind were the Winnipeg Jets.\nThe long layoff certainly gives everyone as much an opportunity to skate with a full roster as we\u2019ve ever seen before the playoffs begin, so don\u2019t be shocked if the Blue Jackets provide another opening-round upset.\nOther teams to watch are the Minnesota Wild, who were finding their form just before time stood still, and the veteran-laden Chicago Blackhawks, who will face the young Oilers.\n--By Randy Sportak, Field Level Media\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"url": "/article/idUSL1N2D82B8", "headline": "US STOCKS-S&P 500 rises on economic recovery and vaccine hopes, pulls back from highs", "published_date": "2020-05-26", "text": "By Sin\u00e9ad Carew\n4 MIN READ\nNew York (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed higher on Tuesday on optimism about the development of coronavirus vaccines and a revival of business activity, but the S&P 500 failed to hold above the key psychological level of 3,000 points.\n Stocks pared gains late in the session, after Bloomberg News reported the Trump administration was weighing a range of sanctions on Chinese officials, businesses and financial institutions, reinforcing comments earlier in the day from White House adviser Larry Kudlow.\nKudlow said President Donald Trump was \u201cso miffed with China on virus and other matters that the trade deal is not as important to him as it once was.\u201d\nThe benchmark S&P 500 .SPX had crossed 3,000 for the first time since March 5 before dropping back late in the session.\nThe S&P 500 has risen as much as 37.9% from its March 23 low due to central bank and government stimulus at a time when the U.S. economy is seeing its biggest job losses since the Great Depression of the 1930s.

The intervention by the chief of staff\u2019s office has not been previously reported.\nThe about-face, given scant attention at the time, marked a turning point in the federal government\u2019s handling of the crisis, according to the four people. Behind the scenes, they said, power was shifting from the Health Ministry, the traditional leader on public health matters, to the office of the president\u2019s chief of staff, known as Casa Civil, led by Walter Souza Braga Netto, an Army general.\nBrazil has lost two health ministers in the past six weeks - one was fired, the other resigned - after they disagreed publicly with Bolsonaro over how best to combat the virus. The interim leader now in charge of the Health Ministry is another Army general.\nMore importantly, the revisions underlined the hardening of Bolsonaro\u2019s view that keeping Brazil\u2019s economy running was paramount, the people said. Bolsonaro, a far-right former Army captain, has never wavered on that stance formulated during a crucial few days in mid-March, despite domestic and international criticism of his handling of the crisis, and a snowballing death toll.\nBrazil now has the world\u2019s second-worst outbreak behind the United States, with more than 374,000 confirmed cases. More than 23,000 Brazilians have died from COVID-19.\n\u201cSo what?\u201d Bolsonaro said recently when asked by reporters about Brazil\u2019s mounting fatalities. \u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d\nCasa Civil said changes to the March 13 guidance were made by the Health Ministry, following input from states and municipalities.\nThe Health Ministry said there had been a divergence of views due to differing situations in states and cities nationwide. It said the implementation of physical distancing measures was the responsibility of local health authorities.\n\u201cThe strategy of the Brazilian response to COVID-19 was not impaired at any point,\u201d the ministry said.\nBolsonaro\u2019s office declined to comment for this story.\nReuters interviewed more than two dozen current and former government officials, medical experts, healthcare industry representatives and doctors to paint the most complete picture yet of Brazil\u2019s missteps in containing the coronavirus outbreak in South America\u2019s largest country.\nThey described a response that began promisingly, but which was soon hobbled by the president\u2019s clashes with Health Ministry and cabinet officials who could not persuade him that Brazil\u2019s economic fortunes ultimately hinged on how effectively it tackled its public health emergency.\nHealth experts were sidelined, the people said, and Bolsonaro embraced an unproven remedy to treat COVID-19 infections. Federal coordination foundered. State governors \u2013 some of whom Bolsonaro regards as re-election rivals \u2013 were left to set their own physical distancing policies and secure much of their own tests and equipment, the sources said.\nSome experts said Brazil\u2019s stumbles are all the more shocking because of its previous success containing malaria, Zika and HIV.\n\u201cOne thing that has been a shining light in Brazil has been their public health system,\u201d said Albert Ko, a professor at the Yale School of Public Health who has decades of experience in Brazil. \u201cTo see that all disintegrate so quickly, it\u2019s just been very sad.\u201d\n\u2018THE FRIDGE IS EMPTY\u2019\nWhen Brazil\u2019s first coronavirus case was confirmed on February 26, the Health Ministry had been preparing for nearly two months.\nIts personnel were running models to estimate when and how to implement stay-at-home orders in collaboration with state and local officials, sources said. The ministry was the command center for an emergency committee coordinating the federal response across multiple agencies.\nBrazil\u2019s vast size, underfunded public hospitals and widespread poverty were vulnerabilities. But the country boasts top medical scientists and a competent private healthcare sector. It had weeks of advance warning, as the virus hit countries like China and Italy first. Those on the frontline thought Brazil was in good shape to respond.\nBut the people who spoke with Reuters said things began to unravel along two main fronts: Bolsonaro\u2019s opposition to shutdown measures favored by the Health Ministry and the government\u2019s inability to scale up testing quickly.\nCabinet members tried numerous times to persuade Bolsonaro to endorse a nationwide lockdown, according to a person with direct knowledge of the discussions. Bolsonaro refused, the person said, believing the virus would soon pass and that health officials were exaggerating the need for physical distancing that had proved effective in other parts of the world.\n\u201cThe masses aren\u2019t able to stay at home because the fridge is empty,\u201d Bolsonaro said to the media on April 20 outside his official residence in Bras\u00edlia.\nBolsonaro\u2019s office declined to comment on why he prioritized the economy. He faced pressure to do so, however. Members of his conservative base have protested in cities across Brazil against lockdowns that threaten his promise to rekindle economic growth.\nYet Bolsonaro\u2019s economic advisors appeared slow to grasp the scale of the crisis. Economy Minister Paulo Guedes, a hardline free-market advocate, in mid-March told CNN Brasil that the nation\u2019s economy in 2020 could \u201creasonably grow 2% or 2.5% with the world falling\u201d because of coronavirus.\nThat prediction was far off the mark. Manufacturing activity has collapsed, unemployment is rising and Brazil\u2019s currency is down around 30% against the dollar this year. On May 15, Barclays cut its 2020 gross domestic product forecast for Brazil to -5.7% from -3.0%. It cited Brazil\u2019s \u201cineffective\u201d policy in dealing with the pandemic.\nThe Economy Ministry now projects GDP will contract by 4.7% this year. In an emailed statement, it said its forecasts have evolved in line with the gravity of the situation.\nGuedes declined a request to comment on his earlier prediction.\nA Guedes ally, Solange Vieira, who was involved in the government\u2019s landmark pension reform last year, likewise showed little urgency when presented with forecasts in mid-March from the Health Ministry, according to epidemiologist Croda. The ministry predicted widespread fatalities among Brazil\u2019s elderly if the virus wasn\u2019t contained.\n\u201c\u2018It\u2019s good that deaths are concentrated among the old,\u201d Croda recalled Vieira saying. \u201c\u2018That will improve our economic performance as it will reduce our pension deficit.\u2019\u201d\nSlideshow ( 7 images )\nCroda\u2019s account was backed by another official, speaking on condition of anonymity, who was told what happened but was not in attendance.\nVieira did not respond to a message on LinkedIn. The Superintendence of Private Insurance, which she leads, said in response to questions about her comments that she attended the mid-March meeting at the invitation of then-Health Minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta to understand the ministry\u2019s projections.\nVieira observed the impacts of various scenarios \u201calways with a focus on the preservation of lives,\u201d it said in a statement.\nPRESSURE FROM ABOVE\nFor a few days in March, it looked like the fallout from a trip to Florida to meet U.S. President Donald Trump might have altered Bolsonaro\u2019s thinking on coronavirus.\nJust after returning from the visit, on March 12, Bolsonaro\u2019s press secretary tested positive for COVID-19. In the following days, nearly two dozen Brazilians who had made the trip would test positive, embarrassing the government and sparking fears that both Bolsonaro and Trump might have been infected.\nAfter undergoing a coronavirus test on March 12, Bolsonaro called on his supporters to suspend nationwide rallies planned for March 15 for fear of worsening the spread. The following day, he said his test came back negative. The Health Ministry, meanwhile, announced its initial social distancing recommendations at a press conference in the capital.\nThen things changed.\nShortly after the new guidelines were issued on March 13, Croda said he got a call from his former boss, Health Surveillance Secretary Wanderson Oliveira, who said he was \u201cunder lots of pressure from Casa Civil and had to change the communique\u201d published by the ministry outlining the measures. Croda said Oliveira did not say specifically who at Casa Civil had demanded the guidelines be weakened.\nWithin 24 hours, the ministry had changed the recommendations on its website. It removed guidance on self-quarantines for travelers and the cancellation of cruises, saying those measures were up \u201cfor review.\u201d And it revised the cancellation of large events to apply only to areas with local transmission.\nOliveira did not respond to requests for comment. He recently left the Health Ministry.\nOn March 15, Bolsonaro ignored his own pronouncement from three days earlier discouraging mass rallies by his supporters. He met with a friendly crowd of demonstrators outside the presidential palace. Wearing the Brazil national soccer jersey, the president bumped fists and posed for selfies.\n\u201cIt was the first time we saw that totally different stance,\u201d then-Health Minister Mandetta told Reuters.\nThe next day, on March 16, Bolsonaro formalized the shift of power away from the Health Ministry, creating an inter-governmental \u201ccrisis cabinet\u201d led by Braga Netto, the Army general heading Casa Civil. Brazil registered its first coronavirus death on March 17.\nIn a response to Reuters\u2019 questions, Braga Netto\u2019s office said the group was formed because the pandemic \u201ctranscended\u201d public health.\nThree people familiar with the situation told Reuters the new cabinet effectively superseded the cross-agency group that had already been set up inside the Health Ministry. The big difference, they said, was that Braga Netto now had the final say, instead of public health experts, and that economic concerns were given more weight.\nThe Health Ministry said it would not comment on economic matters. It said the response to coronavirus cut across government departments.\nCroda left shortly after the creation of the new command center. He told Reuters he did not want to be held responsible for \u201cexcessive deaths.\u201d\nIn the weeks that followed, policy differences between Bolsonaro and Health Minister Mandetta broke out in the open. Mandetta continued to advocate for stay-at-home measures in defiance of the president. He also urged caution about the malaria drug chloroquine. Bolsonaro, following the lead of U.S. President Donald Trump, was increasingly promoting the drug as a possible cure for COVID-19 despite little evidence of its efficacy.\nMandetta\u2019s popularity added to the tension. An early-April survey by pollster Datafolha showed that the Health Ministry under his leadership had a 76% approval rating, more than twice that of Bolsonaro.\nOn April 16, after days of mounting speculation, Bolsonaro fired Mandetta. He replaced him with Nelson Teich, a respected oncologist and healthcare entrepreneur with no public health experience.\nTwo recently departed Health Ministry sources said the last half of April was lost while Teich \u201cfound his feet.\u201d Decisions on testing and new equipment were delayed, they said. More than 15 public health experts, including experienced epidemiologists, left with Mandetta, one of the sources said. Many were replaced by military personnel.\n\u201cThese changes greatly affect the capacity, speed, and the very quality of the response,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Tempor\u00e3o, a former health minister who led Brazil\u2019s crisis response to the 2009 swine flu epidemic. \u201cIt was a disastrous decision.\u201d\nThe Health Ministry denied that its response was hampered by the changes.\nOn May 15, Teich resigned after less than a month on the job. Bolsonaro had criticized him for being too timid in promoting the re-opening of Brazil\u2019s economy and the usage of chloroquine.\nTeich did not respond to a request for comment.\nIn a televised interview with GloboNews on Sunday, Teich said Bolsonaro\u2019s desire for a rapid expansion of the use of chloroquine in Brazil was what led him to quit.\nTeich\u2019s departure accelerated military influence within the Health Ministry. Eduardo Pazuello, an active-duty Army general with no medical background, is now interim health minister. Of the eight people at the top of the ministry, only one had a military background in March. Now three of them do. At least 13 military personnel also have been appointed to lower ministry positions.\nDays after Teich\u2019s departure, the ministry cleared the way for the widespread use of chloroquine to treat patients with mild cases of COVID-19.\nThe armed forces are widely respected in Brazil and often help with logistics during emergencies. But Wildo Araujo, a former Health Ministry official who co-authored one of the country\u2019s first major COVID-19 studies, said military personnel were being placed in unsuitable roles.\n\u201cI have the utmost respect for the armed forces, but I pity those entering now because they have no idea what to do,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know how to deal with the Brazilian public health system.\u201d\nBrazil\u2019s Army declined to comment, referring questions to the Health Ministry, which also declined to comment on the military\u2019s role.\nTESTING TIMES\nBolsonaro\u2019s opposition to social distancing and refusal to support local authorities in their attempts to impose lockdowns have helped erode compliance with those measures, experts said.\nA Reuters analysis of Google mobility data, which collates cell phone movement and compares it to a pre-pandemic benchmark, showed a far smaller reduction in people coming and going from transit hubs and places of work in Brazil than in European countries such as Italy, France and the United Kingdom where shelter-in-place measures have been effective.\nReuters also found Brazil\u2019s mobility reduction was less than that of other developing nations, for example Argentina, India and South Africa. Reuters analyzed data from 17 countries across Africa, Europe, Latin America and Asia for the month of April.\nLike other countries, including the United States, Brazil has also struggled to secure the tests it needs. That\u2019s a major failing, some epidemiologists say, which has made it harder to track and control the virus in Brazil.\nThe shortage of tests is due in part to the Health Ministry\u2019s over-reliance on one institution.\nAccording to an internal Health Ministry document viewed by Reuters, the ministry began purchasing diagnostic test kits through the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz), a respected public health institute, between January and February.\nBy April 7, however, Fiocruz had only delivered 104,872 - or 3.5% - of the roughly 3 million kits the ministry had ordered, the document said. Croda and others said Fiocruz struggled to acquire crucial reagents on the international market. Industry sources said years of budget cuts may also have been a factor.\nThe Health Ministry should have established a broad network of private and public labs, one source said, which would have improved the ability to procure reagents and process tests.\nIn a statement, Fiocruz said it had met all its obligations to the Health Ministry.\nIt said it surpassed an initial target of 220,000 tests by April 13 and delivered nearly 1.3 million tests by the last week of that month. It said it expects to deliver 11.7 million tests by September.\n\u201cThe worldwide competition for this type of test was very large,\u201d it said, \u201cwhich caused a shortage of products.\u201d\nBureaucracy also hamstrung Brazil. A batch of 500,000 antibody tests, used to determine who has had the virus, got stuck at S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s Guarulhos airport for 9 days as the health regulator processed an exception for them to be distributed without Portuguese labels, two people with knowledge of the situation told Reuters.\nThe Health Ministry declined to comment on the incident. It said it has increased testing capacity and will conduct 46.2 million tests, without specifying a time frame. \u201cThe initiative is part of efforts to find new purchases in the national and international market,\u201d it said.\nAs of May 12, however, Brazil had processed just 482,743 tests. Of the 10 countries with the highest COVID-19 death toll, only the Netherlands had tested fewer people than Brazil - a country with a twelfth of the population.\n($1 = 5.4548 reais)\nReporting by Gabriel Stargardter and Stephen Eisenhammer; additional reporting by Ricardo Brito, Pedro Fonseca, Marcela Ayres and Lisandra Paraguassu; Editing by Marla Dickerson\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}, {"url": "/article/idUSKBN231112", "headline": "Chicago artist fills pesky potholes with pandemic art", "published_date": "2020-05-25", "text": "By Brendan O\u2019Brien\n3 MIN READ\nSlideshow ( 7 images )\nCHICAGO (Reuters) - The COVID-19 pandemic has been a bumpy road for many Chicagoans, but they have mosaic artist Jim Bachor to thank for paving the way to some unexpected smiles with four additions to his \u201cpothole art\u201d series installed on the city\u2019s North Side.\nAlong a side street near the iconic Green Mill jazz club in the Uptown neighborhood, Bachor has created four glass and marble mosaics inside small craters in the pavement.\nThe colorful creations, which glisten in the sunlight, refer to symbols of the city\u2019s experience with the pandemic.
