He then proceeded to browbeat Crews, who had committed the great sin of tweeting, \"#ALLBLACKLIVESMATTER 9 black CHILDREN killed by violence in Chicago since June 20, 2020.\" Lemon specifically objected to Crews' hashtag. After Lemon humbly informed Crews that he has skin \"as tough as an armadillo,\" he then lectured: \"The Black Lives Matter movement was started because it was talking about police brutality. ... But that's not what Black Lives Matter is about. It's not ... all-encompassing ... The Black Lives Matter movement is about police brutality and injustice in that matter, not about what's happening in Black neighborhoods.\"\nThis, of course, is largely false. The Black Lives Matter movement did indeed begin with protests about police brutality but quickly morphed into broader debates over the validity of looting and rioting, tearing down historic statues, slavery reparations and defunding the police. And Black Lives Matter, as Crews correctly pointed out, has never restricted its mandate to the question of police violence: It has announced that its focuses also include police brutality, transgender rights, gay rights, disrupting the nuclear family and freeing Palestine, among other diverse topics.\nSo why is Lemon so deeply invested in preventing conversations about Black lives? Why, in fact, do only some Black lives matter, rather than all?\nBLACK LIVES MATTER PHILADELPHIA LEADER PROPOSES FIVE-YEAR PLAN TO ABOLISH POLICE\nThat's not merely a question asked by conservatives or contrarians. It's being asked all over the United States by Black Americans being left to the predations of criminals, in large part thanks to the woke virtue signaling of many Black Lives Matter leaders and media allies. In Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser emblazoned the enormous yellow words \"BLACK LIVES MATTER\" on 16th Street. Protesters quickly added \"DEFUND THE POLICE.\" One month later, 11-year-old Davon McNeal was shot in the head while heading to a family cookout on July 4. His grandfather, John Ayala, lamented: \"We're protesting for months, for weeks, saying, 'Black Lives Matter. Black Lives Matter.' Black lives matter it seems like, only when a police officer shoots a Black person. What about all the Black-on-Black crime that's happening in the community?\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\nMcNeal was just one of the latest victims of a wave of violence gripping America's major cities. Last weekend, at least 89 people were shot in Chicago, leaving at least 17 dead. Shootings in Philadelphia have spiked 67 percent. In the first week of June, Los Angeles saw a shocking 250 percent increase in murders from the prior week. New York City's shootings have skyrocketed 44 percent over last year's numbers; every person shot there the week of June 29 -- 101 -- was from a minority community. It turns out that the agenda of Black Lives Matter, which includes fighting against the prevalence of police -- a call taken up by Democratic mayors and city councils around the United States -- endangers Black lives far more than the presence of police.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nYet these lives don't particularly matter for Black Lives Matter advocates, apparently. Black lives matter when we're talking about police brutality. But Don Lemon has no airtime each night for those who seek to talk about threats to Black lives that dwarf in severity problems related to policing -- and that are just as newsworthy. Indeed, the statistical case is unassailable that the daily murder of minority youths in America's major cities is far more newsworthy than the latest cable panel discussion of \"white fragility\" or the \"power of whiteness.\"\nBut our current Black Lives Matter moment isn't about Davon McNeal, even if the wages of Black Lives Matter's recommended policies are death for those left unprotected by law enforcement. All that matters for too many in our elite institutions is the narrative that America's systems are the greatest obstacle to Black Americans. And not all lives lost are equally valuable in promoting that perverse narrative.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM BEN SHAPIRO"}, {"url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/lawmakers-bicker-after-swalwell-calls-on-republicans-to-say-black-lives-matter", "headline": "Lawmakers bicker after Swalwell calls on Republicans to say \u2018Black lives matter\u2019", "published_date": "2020-06-17", "text": "Rep.

Deray Mckesson, a prominent Black Lives Matter spokesperson, wrote in 2016: \"The DNCC memo re: the movement highlights a serious lack of attention to issues related to black people. Has their view changed since 2015?\"\nSome concrete reforms, contrary to the 2015 memo, are apparently on the way. After kneeling for several minutes, top Democrats on Monday introduced a sweeping criminal justice reform bill, which includes a limitation on police officers' qualified immunity to certain forms of lawsuits for misconduct on the job.\nCritics say qualified immunity, a judge-made doctrine, is necessary to protect police from complaints that would punish officers for reasonably executing their duties in stressful situations, or complaints intended to harass officers. Democrats charge, however, that qualified immunity is a shield for bad behavior and has enabled a culture of misconduct.\nThe \u201cJustice in Policing Act of 2020\u201d would also establish a registry of police misconduct, and would specifically allow officers to be punished for violating constitutional rights \"knowingly or with reckless disregard.\u201d The federal standard currently permits officers to be prosecuted only for \u201cwillfully\" violating constitutional rights -- a significantly higher standard of proof.\nDOJ REVEALS STRIKING RIOT ARRESTS -- INCLUDING HELICOPTER LASER STRIKE, IMPERSONATING A MARSHAL\nFurther, the federal standard for use of force would change from \u201creasonableness\u201d to situations where it is \u201cnecessary to prevent death or serious bodily injury.\u201d\nThe White House has also announced its own planned police reforms in the past week.\nThe changes come amid a tense national conversation on race and police. In extraordinary cases just this week, an LA Galaxy soccer player was fired because of his wife's posts on Black Lives Matter; a UCLA lecturer was suspended for pointedly refusing to cancel his exam for black students; and a Cornell Law School faculty member was threatened with termination for criticizing the group.

Statements of fact and opinion that were entirely within the bounds of reasonable conversation just last Sunday, suddenly, a week later, were enough to get you fired from your job. And a number of people were fired.\nAn awful lot happened this weekend. We want to assess the aftermath of it all, suggest what it may mean, and where this country is likely to go from here.\nBut first, we want to give you a sense of what happened. We're going to begin in Minneapolis, where the Black Lives Matter riots first began almost two weeks ago.\nAs the violence there raged, some Democratic leaders in Minneapolis came to a conclusion that didn't, on the surface anyway, make intuitive sense. What their city really needs, they decided, is less law enforcement -- in fact, no law enforcement.\nSo, they began to demand that Minneapolis \"defund the police.\" Now, the first thing you notice about this idea is how unpopular with the public it is. Almost nobody in the country supports it. But the activists, undeterred, kept pushing the idea, and within days, pressure mounted on the mayor of Minneapolis, Jacob Frey, to get rid of his city's police department.\nThis was a problem for Frey. Frey has greater political aspirations. And this was the last conversation he wanted to have. So, Frey did his best to change the subject with a mix of manic enthusiasm, and feigned empathy.\nFrey is well-practiced in those areas. Here he is a couple of years ago with his preferred brand of community outreach - dancing with his constituents.\nIt didn't work -- then or now. Activists wanted actual answers. So Mayor Frey tried step two in the process -- groveling.\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey: I've been coming to grips with my own brokenness in this situation, my own failures, my own shortcomings and I know there needs to be deep-seated --\nUnidentified female: [Expletive]\nAgain, good try, \"brokenness.\" It sounds like a sermon; give a raise to the staffer who scripted that.

You're wasting our time. Get the [expletive] out of here.\nCrowd (chanting): Go home, Jacob. Go home, Jacob. Go home. Go home, Jacob. Go home. Go home, Jacob. Go home.\nWhat a remarkable piece of tape that is. Has a big city mayor in this country ever been more thoroughly humiliated? \"Get the F out of here,\" she screams. \"Go!\"\nWell, the correct answer to that, needless to say, is, \"Up yours, lady. I'm not going anywhere. I run this city.\" Do you doubt that the entire crowd would have cheered Jacob Frey if he had said that? People always admire resolve even when they disagree with the point of view. But that's not what Jacob Frey did. Frey slunk away like a child caught doing something filthy.\nThe most telling moment, though, came just before that, when the woman in sunglasses threatened to defeat the mayor in the next election. What does that tell you? It tells you that Black Lives Matter is in fact a political party, maybe the strongest political party in the United States. Its members believe they can reshape this country and so far, they're proving to be right.\nYou can always tell which political movements are ascendant, which are headed up, by how straightforward their members and sympathizers are about what they believe. Strong people say what they think out loud. They have no reason not to. They're not embarrassed about their beliefs. They think they're winning.\nIn the future, the left envisions, the only people who will have guns are people on their team, and that's exactly what defund the police really means. It means a woke militia policing our cities, enforcing Democratic Party orthodoxy.\nWith that in mind, watch this clip from CNN Monday morning. This is the president of the Minneapolis City Council, Lisa Bender. Bender explains that the desire for safety, the desire not to, for example, have your home invaded by violent criminals, is in fact a sign of racism.\nAlisyn Camerota, CNN anchor: Do you understand that the word \"dismantle\" or \"police-free\" also makes some people nervous. For instance, what if in the middle of the night, my home is broken into. Who do I call?\nLisa Bender, president of the Minneapolis City Council: Yes. I mean, I hear that loud and clear from a lot of my neighbors. And I know and myself, too, and I know that that comes from a place of privilege because for those of us for whom the system is working, I think we need to step back and imagine what it would feel like to already live in that reality, where calling the police may mean more harm is done.\n\"Hello, police? Armed men are breaking into my home. Help!\" \"Shut up, racist. Click.\" That's the world Lisa Bender is calling for.\nHow many people watching CNN this morning as they got dressed agreed with Lisa Bender? Sure, that sounds reasonable. Calling the police during a break-in definitely qualifies as racism. It's hard to believe even among CNN's audience that very many people thought that --  it's so obviously nuts.\nOn the other hand, it doesn't really matter at this point what the public thinks about anything. In the case of this idea, many Democratic leaders are already sold on it.\nHere's former congressman Keith Ellison on MSNBC over the weekend. Keep in mind as you watch him speak that Ellison is now the chief law enforcement officer in Minnesota. He is the attorney general. Ellison argues that it's wrong for police to bring guns to domestic violence calls. Seriously.\nKeith Ellison, attorney general of Minnesota: We send out people with guns, and they are there to use deadly force no matter what the problem may be.\nIf the problem is sexual assault, we send somebody with a gun. If the problem is domestic violence, we send somebody with a gun. If the problem is somebody with a mental health crisis, we send somebody with a gun.\nOkay, we know what you're thinking. That's Keith Ellison, kind of an unfair example. Ellison has long been a crazy person who was once attached to the Nation of Islam. Back then, he called himself Keith Hakeem. More recently, Ellison endorsed Antifa. Yes, that's all true.\nBut unlike other race-baiting extremists, Keith Ellison may have a promising political future. It's very easy to imagine it. If Joe Biden wins, Keith Ellison could be the attorney general of the United States. At the very least, he would be first in line to become U.S. attorney for the State of Minnesota, the top federal prosecutor there. What would happen then? We may live to find out.\nAgain, all of this probably strikes you as wild-eyed craziness, flat Earth stuff. Eliminate the police? Really? But things change fast. Look how quickly they changed just over the weekend.\nDemocrats have no intention of abolishing the police. Listen carefully and you will hear them admit that. Instead, they want to replace the police -- take the people who currently have badges, many of whom, by the way, voted for Donald Trump and swap them out for new people, people who hate Donald Trump and hate the people who voted for Donald Trump.\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who is a skilled trend spotter if there ever was one, is already acting as if defund the police -- again, a proposal that no sane person even mentioned in public just last month -- is now the defining civil rights issue of our time. You'd have to be a bigoted dinosaur, a bad person, to oppose it.\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.: This is one of those moments. This, right now, is one of those moments. So, if you're an elected official that for any reason is on this call, I'm asking you to ask yourself, what are you willing to sacrifice to make sure that overfunded police departments are defunded?\nSo think about what you just saw. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez isn't just a member of Congress. She is maybe the most famous member of Congress. She is also a surrogate for Joe Biden. So, a lot is on the line here.\nOcasio-Cortez didn't say that accidentally. She had a reason for saying it. Why did she say that? What is going on here?\nWell, as usual, the truth bears no resemblance whatsoever to what they're telling you.\nThink about it for just a second. Democratic politicians control the police departments of virtually every big city in this country. Now, they're telling you they want to get rid of those police departments. If they did, that would mean less power for themselves. So, right away, you know, there's lying going on. Democrats do not relinquish power voluntarily, ever. Period. Republicans frequently do. Democrats never do. So, that's the first thing to know.\nSomething obviously is going on here beneath the surface. This has to be an attempt to increase the power of the Democratic Party because every policy they push is always. And in fact, that's exactly what's happening here.\nDemocrats have no intention of abolishing the police. Listen carefully and you will hear them admit that. Instead, they want to replace the police -- take the people who currently have badges, many of whom, by the way, voted for Donald Trump and swap them out for new people, people who hate Donald Trump and hate the people who voted for Donald Trump. That's what's actually happening here, and it makes sense.\nLaw enforcement is one of the very few institutions remaining in this country that the left has not yet controlled. Democrats hate the police because they don't control the police. Very simple.\nRemember 35 years ago when Democrats were constantly attacking the U.S. military? We don't hear that anymore. Why is that? It's very simple. The left took over the Pentagon. No reason to attack people you control, which they do. And they plan to do the same thing to your local police department.\nLet's be clear: What Democrats are proposing isn't some form of radical libertarianism with the cops leaving citizens to police their own neighborhoods. No, it's the opposite of that. What they're proposing is a power grab.\nDefund the police is a move toward authoritarian social control, cloaked in the language of identity politics. Already, in the middle of a total breakdown of law and order as we watch our cities burn, you are seeing new moves to prevent you from defending yourself and your family in the middle of it.\nJust last Tuesday, Marjorie Greene, who is running for Congress in Georgia, posted this ad on Facebook and within two days, Facebook pulled it down.\nMarjorie Greene, running for Georgia's 14th Congressional District: I have a message for Antifa terrorists. Stay the hell out of Northwest Georgia. You won't burn our churches, loot our businesses or destroy our homes.\nHere's the new rule and it defines everything: You are not allowed to question Black Lives Matter in any way. Full stop. That rule has been enforced without mercy everywhere and not just in this country.\nSo, Facebook has a policy against violence --n not the violence engulfing our cities, but the violence of you defending your family. They create the chaos, you're not allowed to defend yourself. You are, in other words -- and this is, of course, the point -- wholly dependent upon them.\nIn the future, the left envisions, the only people who will have guns are people on their team, and that's exactly what defund the police really means. It means a woke militia policing our cities, enforcing Democratic Party orthodoxy.\nImagine if the Diversity Inclusion Department at Brown University had the power to arrest you. Imagine if the Black Lives Matter rioters had weapons and immunity from prosecution. That's what they're talking about. Partisan law enforcement and partisan law enforcement, incidentally, is hardly without precedent. In fact, it's the rule in the third world. This is an attempt to bring it here.\nWhat is again striking is how few American voters support this, very few. Polling from just a week ago shows that only 16 percent of Americans favored cutting funding to police departments. There was almost no party divide on that question surprisingly.\nThe numbers were virtually the same for Republicans and Democrats. The divide was economic.\nIf you make more than $100,000.00 a year, you are more than twice as likely to think cutting the police was a good idea. And there's no mystery there, of course; rich people live in safe places. They can afford their own security. Jeff Bezos doesn't need the police, he has got his own.\nUnfortunately for the rest of us -- and it is unfortunate --  Jeff Bezos and people like him are the only ones allowed to talk right now. It's hard to overstate how vicious the crackdown on free speech and free thought has been in the last few days.\nHere's the new rule and it defines everything: You are not allowed to question Black Lives Matter in any way. Full stop. That rule has been enforced without mercy everywhere and not just in this country.\nIn Vancouver, a men's basketball coach was fired for liking a tweet that questioned Black Lives Matter. Meanwhile, a player on the LA Galaxy -- that's the professional soccer team in Los Angeles -- was fired because his wife said something critical online. Not him, he didn't do it. His wife. It doesn't matter. They canned the player anyway.\nImagine being a high school student right now. High school students who refuse to show affirmative support for Black Lives Matter on their Instagram accounts were shunned by their friends. Journalists who asked too many questions about the group were fired or silenced. Again, not an exaggeration.\nNow, you'd think people in the media would resent this; presumably, some do. But almost everybody stayed quiet about it. They were too afraid, and some applauded.\nThe New York Times ran an op-ed demanding that people disown their own families if their families failed to support Black Lives Matter enthusiastically enough. \"Tell your relatives, tell your friends,\" the author wrote .\"You will not be visiting or answering phone calls until they take significant action in supporting black lives through protest or financial contributions.\"\nGot that? Sorry, mom. I know you're old and alone and miss your grandchildren. But we are shunning you until you send more money to Black Lives Matter.\nIn an environment like this -- we've never lived in an environment like this. But you can imagine, in an environment like this, most people get the message very fast and the weak ones are quick to join in just like the good l Red Guards they have always been underneath it all. Here's Mitt Romney on the march.\nSen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah: We need to end violence and brutality and to make sure that people understand that black lives matter.\nMitt just wants to make sure that Americans understand, get through their thick heads, that black lives matter, as if Americans didn't know that. But accusing your entire country of racism turns out to be a pretty small price for someone like Mitt Romney.\nWhat Romney is really worried about -- what all the finance moguls funding this movement are worried about -- is that someone somewhere will ask the obvious questions. How much have you, Mitt Romney personally made? How rich have you become by sending jobs overseas -- working-class jobs? By charging obscene interest rates and by otherwise harming poor and black communities economically? All the basic crimes are economic.\nMitt Romney doesn't want to talk about that at all. So he marches. And Black Lives Matter couldn't be happier about it. The complicity of people like Mitt Romney gives groups like Black Lives Matter strength.\nBlack Lives Matter is becoming more powerful by the hour and they know it. Watch this interview from Saturday in which a Black Lives Matter activist cheerfully admits he may soon incinerate people with gasoline.\nActivist: I am a leader of this FTP Movement. It means a lot of things. It can mean \"free the people.\" It can be \"for the people.\" It can also mean \"fire to property.\"\nWe hope in de Blasio and Cuomo -- come on, talk to us and give the youth some direction. But if they don't, then next up is a Diamond District, and gasoline, thanks to Trump, is awfully cheap.\nThe amazing thing is not just that he said that, though that's shocking enough. The amazing thing is that he said it on television live. He wasn't worried about being arrested.\nHe's not like you at all. You're still not allowed to attend church services or go to big weddings. Too bad you're not friends with D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser. You could do anything.\nIf this is so good for Republicans, explain this: Why does the latest round of national polls indicate that Joe Biden's lead in this race is growing?\nBowser has renamed a park near the White House \"Black Lives Matter Plaza,\" and nobody criticized her for it. MSNBC practically sent her flowers.\nJonathan Capehart, Washington Post editorial writer: Having a mural, Black Lives Matter, in huge block letters across three blocks leading up to the White House. As I said to you on Sunday, badass move that you made.\nWashington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser: The Black Lives Matter mural is a representation of an expression of our saying no, but also identifying and claiming a part of our city that had been taken over by federal forces.\nMayor Bowser was buoyed and gratified by the support she received from our friends over on MSNBC, so she also had Black Lives Matter painted in enormous yellow letters on 16th Street in downtown D.C. Kind of a bold move if you think about it, making a street partisan. Imagine a big city mayor naming a major thoroughfare NRA Avenue or Planned Parenthood Boulevard. You think they would say something about it?\nIt's impressive, in a way, but Black Lives Matter wasn't satisfied by it, not even close. The D.C. Chapter of the group released a statement attacking Mayor Bowser for not giving them complete control of the city's police department: \"This is to appease white liberals while ignoring our demands. Black Lives Matter means defund the police.\"\nGot that? Black Lives Matter means defund the police.\nOh, so that's what Black Lives Matter means. No one really explains that. That's their description, and now we know what Intel and Pepsi and Amazon are supporting when they send money -- defunding the police.\nMore from Opinion\nCal Thomas: Trump and African-Americans \u2013 these are the actions he must take now\nDonna Brazile: Justice in Policing Act \u2013 what's in this historic bill and why it must pass now\nSens. Cotton and Blackburn: Stop depending on China \u2014 here's how we end this threat\nSuddenly, it feels like all the adults have gone to St. Barts and turned off their cell phones. Who is running this country? Who is in charge? Anyone?\nYet, amazingly, some Republicans in Washington seem almost giddy as they watch the country go insane. Democrats have gone too far this time, they'll tell you. We're guaranteed to win in November. You've probably gotten texts to that effect recently from friends.\nIt sounds good, but they are wrong. They're totally and completely wrong on many levels.\nFor one thing, if you care about it, a country, you've got to try. You have an obligation to try your very best to protect and defend it, no matter who is helped in November. That's what patriotism is. It's not about you, it's about America.\nBut leave aside your moral duty, even as a matter of pure politics. This is a mindless analysis. It is a stupid calculation. Bad ideas are like cancer. When you ignore them, when you pretend they're not there, when you just assume, just ride it out, they spread.\nMost people, as we noted, currently oppose defunding the police. That's where the polls stand right now. But will they feel that way in three months? How about in three weeks? In an environment like this, you don't know. Things move fast.\nNFL Commissioner Roger Goodell once opposed mocking the American flag, kneeling to attack the country as racist. Now, Goodell has announced, he is with Black Lives Matter.\nRoger Goodell, NFL Commissioner: We at the National Football League admit we were wrong for not listening to NFL players earlier and encourage all to speak out and peacefully protest.\nWe at the National Football League believe Black Lives Matter.\nI personally protest with you.\nSo, if this is so good for Republicans, explain this: Why does the latest round of national polls indicate that Joe Biden's lead in this race is growing? And that's not a small thing if you plan to live here. If you don't want to live under Attorney General Keith Ellison, so why is it happening?\nMaybe it's because Republicans in Washington have decided to sit this crisis out. They haven't bothered to explain what's wrong. They haven't bothered to tell us anything about what might be flawed about Black Lives Matter, and they don't plan to by the way. They're too cynical. They're too fearful.\nIf Democratic leaders cared about saving the lives of black people -- and they should -- they wouldn't ignore the murder of thousands of young black men in their cities every year. They wouldn't put abortion clinics in black neighborhoods.\nThey're going to pretend like it's not happening, repeat platitudes. Read bumper stickers on the air, nod solemnly and do nothing to protect the country. Why would voters reward that?\nDemocrats, by contrast, who are completely wrong, and in fact are leading us down a path that won't end well, are not ashamed in the slightest of what they believe. Day in and day out, they brag about it. Just on Monday, they kneeled in Washington in submission before Black Lives Matter.\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi: We are here to honor George Floyd. For those who wish to, we will now kneel for our moment of silence.\nNancy Pelosi doing something crazy again.\nBefore you comfort yourself with that thought, keep in mind it wasn't just Nancy Pelosi, not by a longshot. Members of the National Guard kneeled, too. So did a group of FBI agents. So did the Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, who just the other day was wearing blackface. Now, he is with Black Lives Matter. The police chief of Webster, Massachusetts went even further than that. He lay on the ground before them in complete submission.\nAnd then things began to spin completely out of control, not just in this country but throughout the West. As the crowd swelled, and the demand for total ideological conformity grew louder, this latest cultural revolution became a parody of itself, as they always do.\nTell the truth -- and the truth is, this is a good country. Better than any other. Of course, we are flawed, but we are trying, unlike most places. And we have nothing to be ashamed of -- none of us. Immigrants know that best of all. That's why they come here -- a million new Americans every year. They're not coming because America is a racist country. They're coming because it's not.\nIn London, protesters vandalized the statue of Abraham Lincoln -- because what did Abraham Lincoln ever do for black people? In Boston, a mob defaced a monument to the first all-black volunteer regiment in the Civil War. Because black people dying to end slavery sounds like white supremacy to us.\nRight around the same time, a law professor from the University of Chicago called for an armed coup to overthrow the president of the United States, but that didn't get a lot of press because it didn't seem particularly newsworthy under the circumstances. It was that kind of weekend.\nWhat is going on? What is this about?\nEven the outlines are blurry at this point, but we know this: No matter what they tell you, it has very little to do with black lives. If only it did.\nIf Democratic leaders cared about saving the lives of black people -- and they should -- they wouldn't ignore the murder of thousands of young black men in their cities every year. They wouldn't put abortion clinics in black neighborhoods. They would instead do their very best to improve the public schools and to encourage intact families, which we know beyond a shadow of a doubt is central to the life prospects of children.\nIf they tried to make black neighborhoods as safe as their own neighborhoods, they would close the payday lenders that have added so much misery to the lives of poor people of all colors. But they don't even consider doing any of this -- they don't even try. Instead, they encourage theft and mayhem as if that will help. It will not help.\nThis may be a lot of things, this moment we're living through, but it is definitely not about black lives, and remember that when they come for you. And at this rate, they will. Anyone who has ever been subjected to the rage of the mob knows the feeling. It's like being swarmed by hornets. You cannot think clearly. And the temptation is to panic.\nVideo\nBut you can't panic. You've got to keep your head and tell the truth. Tell the truth. If you show weakness of any kind, they will crush you.\nAsk Drew Brees. By some accounts, poor Drew Brees is on his fourth apology for the crime of defending the American flag. He decided to apologize and now, they are using him as a propaganda work in hostage tape after hostage tape.\nAt a moment like this, there is no advantage in cowardice, in being Mitt Romney. You think you're saving yourself? You're just empowering the worst people -- people who hate you. Before you know it, you're confessing to crimes you didn't commit. Don't start.\nTell the truth -- and the truth is, this is a good country. Better than any other. Of course, we are flawed, but we are trying, unlike most places. And we have nothing to be ashamed of -- none of us.\nImmigrants know that best of all. That's why they come here -- a million new Americans every year. They're not coming because America is a racist country. They're coming because it's not. That's all true.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nAnd in our clear moments, we know it's true, even the people claiming it's not. Truth is a defense. No matter what they're telling you at this moment, this moment will pass. Remember that. All moments do.\nWhen it does, we will look back at what we just saw in horror and disbelief. But if you're honest now, you will keep your dignity, and ultimately you will be very glad about that.

(Cornell's dean later issued a defense of academic freedom while condemning the faculty member's remarks.) The Federalist has compiled a slew of other examples.\nIn their petition addressed to the management of the Journal of Political Economy at the University of Chicago, Wolfers and other professors accuse senior editor Harald Uhlig of \"trivializing the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement\" and \"hurting and marginalizing people of color and their allies in the economics profession.\" Black Lives Matter advocates for a \"collective ownership\" economic model, reparations, and the \"immediate release\" of everyone convicted of a drug offense, in addition to defunding police forces and other left-wing agenda items.\nThe petition goes on to falsely accuse Uhlig, the Bruce Allen and Barbara Ritzenthaler Professor in Economics at the University of Chicago, of \"drawing parallels between the BLM movement and the Ku Klux Klan.\" Uhlig, in fact, was explicitly using a common form of argument known as \"reductio ad absurdum.\"\nThe New York Times' Paul Krugman, an anti-Trump columnist who has floated conspiracy theories about employment numbers and famously declared that the Internet would prove less important than fax machines, joined in on the attack, writing: \"Editor of the Journal of Political Economy, a powerful gatekeeper in the profession. And yet another privileged white man who evidently can't control his urge to belittle the concerns of those less fortunate.\"\nWolfers, who kickstarted the petition alongside Michigan State University professor Scott Imberman, further criticized Uhlig for \"disagreeing with the actions of [ex-NFL star Colin] Kaepernick.\" Liberal Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg also opposed Kaepernick's kneeling during the national anthem, but that position has now become retroactively unacceptable in progressive circles. Ginsburg specifically said Kaepernick's kneeling was both \"dumb\" and \"disrespectful.\"\nWolfers did not respond when asked by Fox News whether he would seek Ginsburg's ouster from the Supreme Court.\nPaul Krugman, who predicted the Internet would never catch on, called for a leading professor to step down for criticizing Black Lives Matter. (REUTERS/Franck Robichon)\nAccording to his biography page at the University of Michigan, Wolfers serves as a member of the ostensibly nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office Panel of Economic Advisers. \n\"So revealing how eagerly these fanatics support purging and firing wrong thinkers,\" wrote commentator Andrew Sullivan, responding to one of the faculty members calling for Uhlig to step down. \"It\u2019s their first instinct: punish. They disgust me.\"\nChristopher Brunet, an economist and freelance coder, told Fox News: \"There are a million screeching Berkeley PhDs on Twitter, but the silent majority of economics professors aren't on Twitter -- they are buttoned up, and they overwhelmingly support Harald and freedom of speech.\"\nAfter this article was published, Kenneth Judd, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and an economics expert, also came out in support of Uhlig's right to free speech.\n\"As some people know, I am not a fan of Harald Uhlig,\" Judd began. \"We have had many disagreements, some quite bitter, about his performance as a journal editor. I also disagree strongly with his tweets. However, I am also a strong supporter of freedom of speech, both academic and non-academic. He got an earful last week for his tweet. The only reason I did not give him crap is that I would just be piling on.\"\nProtesters throw a statue of slave trader Edward Colston into the Bristol harbour, during a Black Lives Matter protest rally, in Bristol, England, Sunday June 7, 2020, in response to the recent killing of George Floyd by police officers in Minneapolis, USA, that has led to protests in many countries and across the US. (Ben Birchall/PA via AP)\nJudd continued: \"While I may not like his editorial practices, I have never heard anything indicating any racial prejudice on his part. Endorsing Trump would be far more offensive since that would put a stamp of approval on so many offensive statements, many far more offensive than anything Uhlig has said. Would people argue that he should lose his positions if he endorsed Trump? If his tweets did result in some loss of professional status, how does that improve things in any substantive way? It would not change any attitudes nor anything in economics. It would just cause others to say nothing.\n\"My attitude is let people say stupid things, use your freedom of speech to slap them down when they do, but then get on with the business of real reform,\" Judd concluded.\nDavid Paton, an economics professor at Nottingham University Business School, added: \"Deeply disappointing to see respected economists joining in the 'cancel culture' and trying to get @haralduhlig  removed from his editorial position at JPE. Let's hope they don't succeed.\"\n\"Here is the key point,\" George Mason University economist Robin Hanson wrote. \"If you don't agree with @JustinWolfers's politics, he has no confidence in you as a social scientist. And he thinks enough other social scientists agree with him to push such folks out of the club.\"\nKRUGMAN APOLOGIZES FOR PUSHING CONSPIRACY ON JOBS REPORT\nThe drama began when Uhlig wrote on Twitter Monday night: \"Too bad, but #blacklivesmatter  per its core organization @Blklivesmatter  just torpedoed itself, with its full-fledged support of #defundthepolice.\"\nUhlig continued: \"Suuuure. They knew this is non-starter, and tried a sensible Orwell 1984 of saying oh, it just means funding schools (who isn't in favor of that?!?).But no, the so-called 'activists' did not want that. Back to truly 'defunding' thus, according to their website. Sigh. #GeorgeFloyd and his family really didn't deserve being taken advantage of by flat-earthers and creationists. Oh well. Time for sensible adults to enter back into the room and have serious, earnest, respectful conversations about it all: e.g. policy reform proposals by @TheDemocrat  and national healing.\"\nUhlig's posts came as the movement to defund the police gained traction this week, even though polls show Americans overwhelmingly disapprove of the idea. On Monday, Minneapolis City Council President Lisa Bender told CNN that people worried about having no one to call during a home invasion were speaking from a \"place of privilege.\" Those comments drew widespread backlash.\nEXCLUSIVE VIDEO: TOP DEM ADMITS THEY PREFER TO KEEP BIDEN 'IN THE BASEMENT' \nBy way of solutions, Uhlig wrote that police need better training.\n\"Look: I understand, that some out there still wish to go and protest and say #defundpolice and all kinds of stuff, while you are still young and responsibility does not matter,\" he said. \"Enjoy! Express yourself! Just don't break anything, ok? And be back by 8 pm.\"\nSeparately, in 2017, Uhlig wrote a blog post that asked: \"Would you defend football players waving the confederate flag and dressing in Ku Klux Klan garb during the playing of the national anthem?\"\nThe post did not draw an equivalency between Black Lives Matter protesters and the KKK; instead, Uhlig took pains to mention that he was arguing only that President Trump, by criticizing players who kneel during the national anthem, was not impinging on constitutional rights.\n\"Don\u2019t get me wrong,\" Uhlig wrote in the post, apparently to no avail. \"Of course, these football players have the right to express their views about the treatment of blacks by the police, they have the right to protest President Trump and they have the right to kneel during the national anthem. Club owners have the right to fire them because of it, by the way: so Trump actually did not attack the constitutional rights of football players, but what an annoying and pesky detail, right?\"\nOPINION: ONE WAY TO REALIGN UNIVERSITY TAX INCENTIVES\n\"There are a million screeching Berkeley PhDs on Twitter, but the silent majority of economics professors aren't on Twitter  ... [T]hey overwhelmingly support Harald and freedom of speech.\"\n\u2014 Economist Christopher Brunet\nOn Tuesday, Uhlig's comments were deemed problematic -- and worse.\n\"Racists shouldn't be allowed to gatekeep our profession,\" charged University of Victoria economist Rob Gillezeau. (Even Wolfers had stopped short of calling Uhlig a racist.)\nAmid outcry from faculty members at left-leaning institutions, Uhlig offered something of an apology -- but it wasn't good enough for Wolfers, who called it \"a-- covering.\"\n\"I'm no fan of twitter pile-ons, or call-out culture,\" Wolfers said, despite available evidence. \"A single tweet won't get me upset. But reading through @haralduhlig 's public writing reveals a pattern that's a bit too revealing. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just or fair that Uhlig, as an editor at the @JPolEcon  is an important gatekeeper for economists trying to make their mark. I don\u2019t think the profession\u2019s resolve to look more deeply into racial justice will get a fair hearing under his editorship.\"\nJennifer Doleac, an economics professor at Texas A&M University, gleefully tweeted that she hopes Uhlig won't have his job for \"much longer.\"\nDoleac didn't respond to a request for comment concerning whether she typically threatens students and colleagues with professional consequences for disagreeing with her.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\nWhen Harvard graduate Claira Janover posted a video to TikTok stating her distaste for people who say \u201call lives matter,\u201d she likely wasn\u2019t expecting the widespread backlash that would ensue on the Internet, much less the termination of her employment at Deloitte.\nIn subsequent TikTok videos, she criticizes Deloitte for their \u201ccowardice\u201d and claims, \u201cTrump supporters took my job away from me\u201d because of her videos \u201cstanding up for Black Lives Matter.\u201d\nBut, that\u2019s not what appeared to have happened. Social media users weren\u2019t appalled because she publicly supports Black Lives Matter, as many people do; they were taken aback by the aggression with which Janover spoke about people who represent a differing point of view.\nHARVARD GRAD BLAMES TRUMP SUPPORTERS AFTER 'STAB' VIDEO COSTS HER DELOITTE JOB\nIn the original video, Janover said she\u2019d like to \u201cstab\u201d people who claim \u201call lives matter.\u201d She continued: \u201cWhile you\u2019re struggling and bleeding out, I\u2019ma show you my paper cut and say, \u2018My cut matters too.\u2019\u201d\nWhile we can assume she\u2019s drawing an analogy for what she sees as the illogic of saying \u201call lives matter,\u201d it\u2019s still an unusually cruel way of making a point. Her flippant use of violent imagery is what drew people\u2019s ire, and that\u2019s why, presumably, she lost her job at Deloitte.\nSome commentators have pointed out that this is an example of the \u201ccancel culture\u201d conservatives often complain about and that it\u2019s thus hypocritical for conservatives to applaud Deloitte for their decision. I disagree. Cancel culture typically seeks to ruin the lives of people who violated political correctness either recently or decades ago. That\u2019s not what happened here.\nMore from Opinion\nVictor Davis Hanson: In monument controversy, colleges' hypocrisy is on full display\nTucker Carlson: What holiday should be canceled next?\nJanover\u2019s comments at best made light of violence and at worst threatened it. That\u2019s the kind of thing that would have always, even before the age of Twitter and TikTok, gotten employees of major companies fired. It reflects poorly on the employer. Stating a political opinion is one thing; publicly talking about stabbing someone who disagrees with you\u2014even sarcastically\u2014is another.\nJanover claims to have received death threats from \u201cTrump supporters,\u201d and if that\u2019s true, it\u2019s wrong. No one should ever be subjected to threats of violence, empty or not. Janover simply needs to realize that that includes people who disagree with her, too.\nAs I\u2019m sure she didn\u2019t feel those who have allegedly threatened her were joking, many didn\u2019t take her TikTok video as a joke, either. It\u2019s probably just a good rule of thumb not to seriously or facetiously talk about assaulting and killing people who hold different political opinions than you.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\nThe best outcome would be for Janover to learn a valuable lesson\u2014don\u2019t trivialize violence, and definitely don\u2019t post about it online\u2014and for her to move on with her life. We shouldn\u2019t hope the worst for her. Everyone makes mistakes. Where leftist cancel culture refuses to offer grace, we should extend it.\nUnfortunately, from what we can see, Janover isn\u2019t interested in self-reflection. Her subsequent TikTok videos blaming Trump supporters for her woes demonstrate a stunning lack of self-awareness and an unwillingness to take responsibility for her words. In my view, she doesn\u2019t owe the mob of faceless internet users an apology, but she would do well to show more respect to her former employer than to call them cowards. It\u2019s hard to imagine that kind of attitude bodes well for future job prospects.\nIt seems Janover\u2019s disposition is characteristic of many members of the elite left who believe even the most intensely aggressive speech is appropriate and without need of real-life accountability\u2014as long as it\u2019s for the \u201cright\u201d cause. Viral videos of predominantly female protesters screaming profanities in the faces of police officers show that many believe that the standards of decency and respectfulness don\u2019t apply to people who take up the noble fight for wokeness.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nFree speech is vital for a thriving society. Of course, no one\u2019s speech should be punished or inhibited by the government, and companies should foster an environment that allows for and accepts a diversity of viewpoints. But there always have been expectations employers have for their employees when it comes to public conduct. Deloitte drew the line at violent analogies on TikTok, and it seems like a reasonable one.\nWhat can the rest of us learn? That the words we use matter, and we should be wise and deferential in choosing them. And, when we fail\u2014because we all do\u2014we should take responsibility and own our mistakes. And when others make mistakes, we should offer forgiveness in return.

Last week, it unveiled a separate $6.5 million fund for its network of affiliate chapters.\nBeginning July 1, affiliated chapters can apply for unrestricted funding of up to $500,000 in multi-year grants, the foundation announced.

Its newest chapter is in South Bend, Indiana.\nThe foundation told the AP it has received more than 1.1 million individual donations at an average of $33 per gift since the death of Floyd, a black man who died May 25 pleading for air as a white Minneapolis police officer held a knee to his neck for nearly eight minutes. The surge of financial support adds to roughly $3.4 million in net assets the BLM Global Network had on hand last year, according to a 2019 financial statement of Thousand Currents, the fiscal sponsor which receives donations on the network\u2019s behalf and then releases money to the group.\nFILE - In this June 6, 2020, file photo, demonstrators protest at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, over the death of George Floyd, a black man who was in police custody in Minneapolis.

We don't want to see any police in our community,\" Ndgo told Fox News in an interview Tuesday. \"Over the course of those five years, it gives time for the community to begin to build what is needed.

Thus helping addicts could address some societal ills.\n\"As we address these particular concerns, and at the same time build restorative justice practices, and build out our mental health response teams, and build medic responses,\" she said, \"[These are] responses that really actually deal with the issues that are in place. Then we will have less crime anyway.\"\nANTI-POLICE DEMONSTRATIONS MAY HAVE SPARKED NEW CORONAVIRUS CASES, SOME CITIES NOW ACKNOWLEDGE\nNdgo said the community should deal with the issues from \"the ground up,\" using the money that would have otherwise been poured into the city's police department.\n\"There are plenty of people who have been murdered as a result of mental health checks. The police came, and then they murdered the person, even though the person was acting erratically, which is what you would expect of a person who's having a mental health crisis,\" Ndgo said. \"Domestic confrontations are also things that police are often called for.

So the police are not really a resource for preventing that kind of crime from happening. Just a response,\" she explained.\nMoreover, the Philadelphia-based activist believes that violence exists on many levels, not just stemming from law enforcement.\n\"We also recognize that hunger, unnecessary hunger, is a form of violence, as is unnecessary homelessness (especially) when you have massive numbers of properties that are empty, and then we have people who are all over the city living in tents. We see that also as violence,\" Ndgo said. \"Another example is the fact that a lot of our schools are not safe for our children. There is lead paint in a lot of the schools.

The $14 million was moved elsewhere, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.\nBLM Philadelphia also wants to see changes on a federal level. Ngdo said that the president has the authority to call in the National Guard irrespective of whether the governors or mayors approve it, a power they view as perpetrating \"danger and harm.\"\n\"You see now, the president can have any kind of mindset. And then (they) have a local military force at his or her disposal in order to push that mindset onto communities,\" Ngdo cautioned. \"That would be one thing really important, to transform that policy.\"\nShe said another critical change would be for the \"federal government to actually prioritize the financial discrepancies and inequities in all of our communities.\"\n\"The wealth of the nation is very much into the hands of a very small group of people,\" Ngdo said. \"And the result of that is a massive amount of poverty and poverty, as often, as I mentioned earlier, is a big reason that a lot of crime happens.\"\nDEFUND OR DISMANTLE THE POLICE?

But tragically, demands by some to defund or disband police departments around the nation will only lead to increased crime and the loss of more innocent lives, including Black lives.\nAlready, serious crime is skyrocketing in a number of cities, as criminals take advantage of attacks on police to step up their activity.\nFrom June 29 to July 5, there were 85 shooting incidents and 27 murders in Chicago alone, with most occurring on the city\u2019s predominantly African American South Side.

Far-left politicians have also joined the effort, including self-described socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who complained in late June that action by New York City to cut its police budget by $1 billion \u2014 one-sixth of the total \u2014 didn\u2019t go nearly far enough.\n\u201cDefunding police means defunding police,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said in a statement. \u201cIt does not mean budget tricks or funny math. It does not mean moving school police officers from the NYPD budget to the Department of Education\u2019s budget so the exact same police remain in schools.\u201d\nVideo\nBut radical Black Lives Matter groups \u2014 many of which have explicitly endorsed socialism \u2014 and socialist politicians like AOC are doing the exact opposite of what needs to be done to protect Black lives. If they really believe Black lives matter, they would be seeking increased funding to put more police on the street.\nCan police training and policies be improved to reduce deaths at the hands of police? Yes. Can police do a better job removing officers who resort to violence without justification from their ranks? Of course.\nWhy don\u2019t the Black lives lost to gangs and other criminals matter as much as the Black lives lost to the relatively rare cases of unjustified killings by police?\nReforming and improving the police is a laudable goal. But defunding and dismantling police departments will only make things worse and result in the deaths of more crime victims.\nShould we defund schools because some teachers have raped and assaulted their students? Should we defund hospitals because some doctors have killed patients through medical malpractice? Should we shut down churches because there are documented cases of pedophile priests and other clergy members attacking children?\nOf course not. Defunding police makes no more sense.\nWhy don\u2019t the Black lives lost to gangs and other criminals matter as much as the Black lives lost to the relatively rare cases of unjustified killings by police?\nAnd how do Black Lives Matter activists plan to keep communities safe with smaller police forces when many of these communities aren\u2019t safe now?\nBLM organizers have suggested that police pose such an incredible danger to Black families that cities would be better off without them.\nBut nearly four times more people were killed by criminals in one week (June 29 to July 5) in Chicago alone than the number of unarmed Black people who have been shot and killed by police thus far in 2020 in the entire United States \u2013 about seven.\nAll Americans should stand firmly against police brutality, racism and abuses, and support reasonable reforms like ending no-knock raids and requiring police to wear body cameras. Such reforms have been welcomed by many policymakers across the political spectrum.\nAnd of course, police who commit crimes should be treated like any other criminals \u2014      arrested and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\nBut sending out unarmed social workers and psychologists to deal with rapidly unfolding and potentially dangerous situations won\u2019t work. Armed robbers, rapists, violent gangs and other gunmen sometimes need to be confronted by armed police officers.\nIn many cases, the deterrent effect or presence of police is enough to prevent violence. But sometimes force becomes unavoidably necessary to save the lives of innocent crime victims. Imagine if your own child were in school and a gunman broke in and started shooting, killing children and teachers. Would you want a social worker or armed officers to respond? \nCalls to defund police departments so that activists can expand failing welfare programs and hire an army of social workers aren\u2019t just foolish. Such calls are incredibly dangerous and disrespectful to the families who have lost loved ones at the hands of criminals.\nBlack Lives Matter leaders have argued that crime rates would go down if poverty were reduced. They\u2019re right. Reduced poverty rates are unquestionably associated with lower crime rates, and where there is less crime there is less need for police. But reduced crime is not the same thing as zero crime.\nHowever, it would be insane to slash police budgets to the bone prior to poverty rates falling, and even more insane to think \u2014 as Black Lives Matters claims \u2014 that simply increasing funding for welfare programs would magically reduce poverty.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\nSince the start of President Lyndon Johnson\u2019s \u201cWar on Poverty\u201d more than $20 trillion has been spent on a long list of welfare programs, but poverty rates have hardly improved at all.\nSimilarly, over the past two decades poverty rates among African Americans have only decreased modestly, despite trillions in government spending on poverty programs. And much of the gains occurred only after the Trump administration and the Republican-led Congress reduced regulations and cut taxes in 2017 and 2018.\nBlack communities have been suffering for far too long with higher-than-average poverty and crime rates, but neither problem will be fixed by abolishing the only departments in many of these communities working to keep families safe \u2014 the police.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nOf course Black lives matter. The best thing we can do to show that is to focus on alleviating poverty through proven reforms like enhancing school choice, investing in job training, reforming welfare programs and helping police departments become more effective while also holding them accountable when they violate Americans\u2019 rights.\nBut none of these policies would move our country closer to socialism, so the Black Lives Matter leadership team \u2014 which is composed of numerous \u201ctrained Marxists\u201d \u2014 isn\u2019t interested. Instead, BLM leaders argue it would be better to tear down as many existing American institutions as possible, the police first among them, regardless of the consequences to Black families.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY JUSTIN HASKINS"}, {"url": "https://www.foxnews.com/media/unearthed-don-lemon-clip-blasted-critics", "headline": "CNN\u2019s Don Lemon blasted for hypocrisy over unearthed 2013 clip on Black-on-Black crime", "published_date": "2020-07-09", "text": "CNN's Don Lemon scolds Terry Crews, says Black Lives Matter is about police brutality, not Black-on-Black violence\nCNN host Don Lemon has made news lately for insisting the Black Lives Matter movement isn\u2019t about Black-on-Black crime and downplaying a recent surge in gun violence \u2013 but it turns out the 2013 version of Lemon probably wouldn't care for the current edition.\n\u201cThe Black Lives Matter movement is about police brutality and injustice in that manner, not about what\u2019s happening in black neighborhoods,\u201d Lemon said on Monday before telling actor Terry Crews he can start his own movement if he\u2019s so concerned with \u201cBlack-on-Black\u201d gun violence.\nDON LEMON SAYS BLACK LIVES MATTER ISN'T ABOUT BLACK-ON-BLACK CRIME\nThe \"CNN Tonight\" host also joked on Tuesday about conservative pundits who are concerned about an uptick in crime in Democratic cities.

In recent weeks, a UCLA lecturer was suspended for pointedly refusing to cancel his exam for black students; a Cornell Law School faculty member was threatened with termination for criticizing Black Lives Matter, before the school dean intervened on his behalf; and a top University of Chicago economist was demoted for questioning the wisdom of defunding all police.\nThe call for a \"Black House\" was made in a public Facebook post on Rice's official Graduate Student Association (GSA) page, written by Rice graduate research assistant and GSA vice president of \"Equity and Inclusion\" Dani Perdue. \"Here are what black undergraduate students have demanded from Rice Universuty [sic] administration,\" Perdue wrote. \"I hope they are listening! #NoMoreLipService #blacklivesmatter.\"\nThe post also sought the \"removal\" of an iconic statue of university founder William Marsh Rice; the hiring of \"more black professors, faculty, well-being counselors and therapists\"; the inclusion of \"hate speech\" in Rice's code of conduct; and an increase in the number of black students accepted to Rice.\nAn Instagram account representing the Rice Black Student Association (BSA) has published a longer list of demands, including that \"If a Black new student requests to have a Black roommate [during orientation week], that request be honored.\" That request could run afoul of federal civil rights laws.\nREAD THE STUDENTS' FULL DEMANDS\nThe Black House, according to the BSA's Instagram page, should have all the \"features of a residential college\" but be \"specifically made for Black students and Black organizations to congregate and hold events. ... It would be best to have a central, safe space that Black students can meet and hangout in anytime of the day.\" It was not clear how this description would square with the Facebook post calling for a \"non-residential\" Black House; similar \"affinity\"-branded cultural centers at other universities do not generally have the same \"features\" as residential colleges.\nThe students also seek \"better lighting for ID photos,\" noting that \"many Black students have had significant issues with the photographs that are displayed on our student IDs. ... We deserve to be photographed and represented properly without having to make modifications and adjustments.\"\nMoreover, the students assert, \"course descriptions should include tags that indicate what race/ethnic/cultural groups are included since many course titles do not make it clear if they include diverse perspectives in their course material.\"\nMilkessa Gaga and Kendall Vining, who are listed as contacts for the BSA-affiliated \"working group\" compiling demands to the university, did not immediately respond to Fox News' requests for comment.\nAfter some Rice students on the GSA Facebook page started questioning whether the demand for a \"Black House\" amounted to a call for on-campus segregation, the president of the GSA, Alison Farrish, deleted some of the students' objections and then all other comments, according to messages reviewed by Fox News.\nFarrish did not respond when asked by Fox News why she had deleted the comments. Eventually, the entire demand list vanished from the Facebook page.\nBLM LEADER DOESN'T RULE OUT VIOLENCE IN FOX NEWS INTERVIEW: 'BURN THE SYSTEM DOWN'\nRice University has a 'red' speech code rating from the nonprofit organization FIRE (Foundation for Individual Rights in Education). According to FIRE, a \"red light university has at least one policy that both clearly and substantially restricts freedom of speech.\"\nAllen Porter, a Rice Ph.D. student, told Fox News he was \"confused\" when commenting was suddenly disabled because \"the vast majority of the activity in the comments that I saw was civil discourse among Rice-affiliated persons (graduate students, alumni, etc.). Moreover, when commenting was disabled, I believe the only ongoing activity was in my comment thread.\"\nRice University's campus is located in Houston, Texas. (Google Maps)\n\"I didn't and don't want to jump to any conclusions, but many of the comments -- again, mostly quite civil and mostly from persons affiliated with Rice -- expressed a critical or dissenting view of the poster/infographic relative to the implicit endorsement of it expressed in Dani Perdue's original post,\" Porter continued. \"I don't want to speculate on Alison's intentions or motivations. All I can say is that I did not see sufficient disrespect in the comments to warrant erasing the much greater amount of respectful discourse that was recorded under the post.\"\nPorter urged the \"GSA to err on the side of permissiveness when it comes to regulating the comments on those posts.\"\n\"Intersectional 'progress' is going great.\"\n\u2014 Author James Lindsay\nPerdue and Rice University declined Fox News' requests for comment concerning the demands. For the most part, Perdue's social media feed mixes complaints about President Trump (\"If Trump is elected again I will be the saddest I have ever been in my life,\" she wrote in February, \"including the time when I found out Elmo wasn't real\") with concerns about diversity among small groups in class (\"My prof just picked 5 volunteers...all white men...come on,\" she said in 2013.).\nAlthough Rice is a private university, it accepts federal funds that prevent it from officially endorsing racial discrimination.\nWhile the university wouldn't comment on whether a Black House would be funded, the school has put out several statements concerning racial inequality in the wake of Floyd's death. For example, Rice President David W. Leebron told students that the school would be paying \"increased attention to issues of diversity, equity and inclusion at Rice and in our broader society.\"\nCommentators, however, pointed to the episode as another instance of left-wing campus culture running amok.\n\"Intersectional 'progress' is going great,\" author James Lindsay remarked.\nINSIDE AN EFFORT TO DEPLATFORM 'BLACK LIVES MATTER' CRITIC AT UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO\nRadio host Jesse Kelly wrote, sarcastically: \"William M. Rice said Rice should be 'for whites only'. There\u2019s still a statue of him on campus. That statue MUST come down and @RiceUniversity should be for black people only from now on. It\u2019s the only way to make this right. #CancelRice.\"\nKelly has led ironic efforts to have all major universities \"canceled,\" and to have them change their names -- noting that all of them historically were linked to slavery in some way. (The BSA, in its \"demand\" letter, asserts that the statue of Rice's founder must be removed because he was the \"owner of 15 slaves during the mid-19th century.\" Curiously, the BSA letter does not demand that Rice change its name.)\nFor now, on-campus activists seem intent on fundamentally reshaping, rather than eliminating, universities and society at large. Black Lives Matter advocates for a \"collective ownership\" economic model, reparations and the \"immediate release\" of people convicted of drug offenses, in addition to defunding police forces and other left-wing agenda items.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe movement has led to a tense atmosphere on campuses.

President Trump just committed Roger Stone's lengthy prison sentence. The White House is calling Stone a victim of the Russian hoax.\nNow, the 67-year-old political operative will not face time behind bars. We'll have more on this developing story throughout the show.\nWelcome to this special edition of \"Hannity\". I'm Jason Chaffetz, in tonight for Sean.\nWe are 116 days away from election and Joe Biden has just been accused of plagiarism yet again, this time by the president of the United States. Watch.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: He plagiarized for me. He can never pull it off. He likes plagiarizing.\nIt's a plan that is very radical left but he says the right things because he's copying what I've done, but the difference is he can't do it and he knows he's not doing it. It can't be the same because he's raising taxes way too much. He's raising everybody's taxes.\nHe's also putting tremendous amounts of regulations back on. And those two things are two primary reasons that I created the greatest economy we've ever had and now we are creating it again, OK?\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nCHAFFETZ: President Trump is referring to Biden's so-called Buy American Economic plan, which shares the name with a 2017 Trump executive order.\nAt this point, plagiarism seems like a way of life for Joe Biden who just this week in a recent policy proposal, he lifted multiple sections word for word from Bernie Sanders official platform.\nSeveral years ago, Biden got caught plagiarizing Robert Kennedy and even Hubert Humphrey. Biden was also accused of plagiarism in law school, and let's not forget about one of Biden's favorite people to plagiarize, a British politician named Neil Kinnock. Watch this.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nNEIL KINNOCK, BRITISH POLITICIAN: Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university? Was is Glenys the first woman in her family in a thousand generations to be able to get to university?\nBIDEN: I was thinking as I was coming over here, why is it that Joe Biden is the first in his family ever to go to university? Why is it that my wife is sitting out there in the audience, the first and her family to ever go to college?\nKINNOCK: Was it because all of our predecessors were thick? Did they lack talent -- those people who could sing and play and recite and write poetry?\nBIDEN: Is it because our fathers and mothers were not bright? It's because I am the first Biden in a thousand generations to get a college and a graduate degree that I was smarter than the rest? Those same people who read poetry and wrote poetry and taught me how to sing verse.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nCHAFFETZ: Keep in mind, Joe Biden's first presidential campaign ended in disgrace because his plagiarism issues came to light.\nJoining is now with more is Trump campaign's national press secretary, Hogan Gidley.\nHogan, thank you so much for joining us here tonight.\nI want to talk about Joe Biden's plagiarism, but I really need to get your reaction to what the president did in commuting Roger Stone's sentence today? What's your reaction to that? What's the president's view on this?\nHOGAN GIDLEY, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY: Well, it's a good move by the president, of course. Listen, so many people, so many good people were caught up in this Russian hoax. This was perpetrated by overzealous Democrats, partisan hacks trying to take on a president. We know that the campaign was spied upon, wiretapped, authorized by the previous administration.\nAnd we wouldn't have known of Donald Trump hadn't been elected that Comey and Clapper and Brennan were all lying in front of Congress and in other ways. We wouldn't know the names Lisa Page and Peter Strzok, the two lovers that conspired to take down the president with an insurance policy.\nWe wouldn't know any of that had Donald Trump not been elected. Now we do and I think the president is doing the right thing by trying to write some of the wrongs of the partisanship of the past.\nCHAFFETZ: No, I think you're absolutely right. Imagine if Hillary Clinton had won, the likes of Comey and McCabe and Strzok, they would be running the country at the law-enforcement end of this. So thank goodness that didn't come to fruition.\nThe president is making it very strong accusation accusing anybody of plagiarism but it's not new for Joe Biden. He has been in this boat many, many times throughout his decades of service.\nGIDLEY: Oh, absolutely. We know, look, he plagiarized a couple words from the president's past, but he's plagiarizing the policies from socialists like Bernie Sanders and AOC and Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, Elizabeth Warren. His policies are going to be so detrimental to this country.\nBut let's be clear, we don't have to guess what a Biden economy looks like. We just lived through it for the past eight years -- 850,000 jobs were lost just from NAFTA alone, 70,000 manufacturing plants closed. Millions of jobs lost because of his relationship with China, because of his defense of China.\nWe also don't have to guess how our cities and streets would look if Joe Biden were president. We saw rioters and looters drag innocent Americans just trying to defend their businesses out into the streets, beat them within an inch of their lives, left to lie in a pool of their own blood.\nJoe Biden said nothing when churches were burned, when stores were looted, riots across our city streets. He said nothing about that.\nSo, you don't have to guess what would happen in this country. We've already seen it happen.\nCHAFFETZ: Hogan Gidley, thank you so much for joining us tonight. We do appreciate it.\nGIDLEY: Absolutely, Jason. If I may say one more thing -- just because of Joe Biden's record of the past, not defending the American worker, gutting the American middle class, I have to say I think the only job that Joe Biden has ever fought for that was an American job was for Hunter Biden. But that being said, I don't take that technically counts because that was for a Chinese company. So even still with his son, he's helping out China.\nCHAFFETZ: Good point. Hogan Gidley, thank you again for joining us.\nAll right. Joining us with more reaction to Joe Biden's long and storied history of plagiarism is American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp, along with Arizona Congressman Andy Biggs.\nGentlemen, thank you for joining us here tonight.\nI want to go to you first, Matt, because I've got to tell you, Bernie Sanders is the one that's actually saying that Joe Biden would be perhaps the most progressive president in the history of the United States. We should believe him, shouldn't we?\nMATT SCHLAPP, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION CHAIRMAN: Yeah, when Joe Biden's mouth is flapping, you know, it's actually Bernie Sanders who we are hearing.\nThey very cleverly change the names of some of these policies but it's all the socialist Marxist policies that Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders pine for. It's basically saying that we're going to get zero emissions on fossil fuels, on carbon emissions which means fossil fuels will be illegal. No more fracking.\nSorry, Pennsylvania. Sorry, Ohio. No more fracking. They're even talking about not letting the police carry firearms. It's not just defunding the police. It's now de-arming the police. They are even talking about reparations.\nSo this is very, very radical stuff and the most radical piece of it is he's talking about buying American products to a larger extent from the federal government but guess what, those products can't be made in America when all those regulations that Trump got rid of come back on the books and he increases corporate taxes by another third.\nThere is no way American companies will be competitive, so if you're an American worker and you want to keep that job, Joe Biden is your worst nightmare.\nCHAFFETZ: Now, Congressman, I mean, I kind of giggle when I hear Joe Biden say that he wants to transform the nation, which scares the living daylights out of me. He's only been in political office since 1972 when I was 5 years old kicking a soccer ball.\nBut he is suddenly going to transform the nation and there are issues like immigration and other things I think he wants to take such a radical view and position.\nBut we really don't know who's working for him and who's actually writing the stuff other than AOC and Bernie Sanders, as Matt was talking about.\nREP. ANDY BIGGS (R-AZ): Yes, that's exactly right, Jason.\nIf you want to get a real picture, an indication of what a Biden presidency would be like, this -- you couldn't get a bigger picture than this. What it is is Biden's not going to be the president. He's going to have that title but somebody else is going to be manufacturing these wacky, far left policies.\nThey are so far to the left they are leaving the Democrats behind. This is something that's way out there. This is the \"Squad\" from the Congress that's out there and then you've got Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren who are in there. They're having their fondest dreams put into place.\nAnd Joe Biden, who spent his whole career driving down the middle-of-the- road, just trying to move to the next office, is now going to be co-opted. And that's what's going to happen if he becomes president of the United States. This is a great indication of that future if Biden becomes the president.\nCHAFFETZ: Yeah, if you can't get it done in your first 48 years in office, it probably isn't going to happen.\nBut, Matt, I've got to tell you. Part of what you hear from the Democrats at large and also from Joe Biden is this cancel culture. I mean, Americans are constantly told everything is wrong.\nHow do you think America is actually reacting to this?\nSCHLAPP: Well, look, I have been a victim of this. I've seen it. A friend of mine, the CEO of Goya Foods, he's a victim of this. They are trying to make it a crime, a hate crime, that's punishable for simply being a Republican, being a Christian, having free-market views.\nHow about this one, Jason? Having views consistent with those of Abraham Lincoln or Frederick Douglass, or how about our Founders? They want to make a criminal.\nIt's not just our ripping down statues. It's about destroying the lives of Americans with common sense values.\nThis is fascism. This is fascism of the left. Everybody better wake up because they are coming for each and every person that dares stand up to this angry mob, and we're all going to have to face it. We better face it now. If we wait until later, will we might not have a country anymore.\nCHAFFETZ: Yeah, I love that the left claims to be the party of tolerance but you try to say anything they disagree with and they are the least tolerant.\nCongressman, I've only got about 15 seconds here. But do you think Joe Biden is actually going to debate, is he actually going to speak for himself without the puppeteers, and join Donald Trump on that debate stage?\nBIGGS: I can't see him on a debate stage with President Trump. What I see is him finding a way to do it from his home where he's going to have some teleprompters there, with some people giving him some answers. That's the only way he can compete. That's it. He cannot -- he has no original thoughts of his own.\nCHAFFETZ: Joe Biden needs to live up to his obligation and his commitment to debate Donald Trump and that should happen for three debates, if not four but at least three.\nGentlemen, Congressman Biggs, Matt Schlapp, thank you for joining us tonight. We do appreciate it.\nSCHLAPP: Thanks, Jason.\nCHAFFETZ: All right, coming up for violent is skyrocketing in New York City and Mayor Bill de Blasio is banning all large gatherings except for police protests and riots. You can't make this stuff up. America's mayor, Rudy Giuliani, will react.\nAnd later, the left's war on dissenting voices that hit new levels, as this \"Hannity\" special continuous. Stay with us.\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\nCHAFFETZ: Welcome back to this \"Hannity\" special.\nPresident Trump is returning from Florida aboard Marine One as he goes back to the White House in Washington, D.C.\nChaos continues to rage and liberal cities across the country. In Seattle, home of the short-lived CHOP zone that saw multiple shootings that resulted in the death of two young men, the city council appears to be prepared to defund the police by 50 percent.\nAnd New York City announced that compared to last year, the month of June 2020 saw a 130 percent increase in shootings, 130 percent.\nAnd one store owner there is suing Governor Andrew Cuomo over looting damage and says police were told to stand down. But don't worry. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has banned all large gatherings in the city except for protests and riots of course.\nTake a look.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: What about protests? If people want to march down Fifth Avenue, are they going to be allowed to do so?\nMAYOR BILL DE BLASIO (D-NY), NEW YORK CITY: Look, Wolf, this is always an area of real sensitivity. If you're just talking about health, we would always say, hey, folks, you know, stay home if you can. But we understand in this moment in history, people are talking about the need for historic changes.\nI mean, today, in New York City, you know, recognizing the power and the meaning of the message Black Lives Matter which we did in front of Trump Tower today, this is a historic moment of change. We have to respect that, but also say to people the kinds of gatherings we are used to, parades and fairs, we just can't have that while we're focusing on health right now.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nCHAFFETZ: Joining us now is former mayor of New York City, Rudy Giuliani.\nMr. Mayor, thank you so much for joining us. When you hear Mayor Bill de Blasio say those things and take that position, what runs through your mind?\nRUDY GIULIANI (R), FORMER NYC MAYOR: What runs through my mind is before this, I thought he was the worst mayor in the history of the city, and now, he will have written that like a headline.\nJust think of the contradiction. I mean, everybody else can't march. We have to wear masks. We have to separate ourselves.\nBut if you are protesting, you can stand together. You can spit in each other's face, you can hug and squeeze and you're not going to get COVID-19.\nAnd their phony political party wants us to believe that this is based on science? Science? It's based on political phoniness.\nAlso, Black Lives Matter -- Black Lives Matter is an organization run by three Marxists and financed by a convicted terrorist who I happen to have convicted who got 58 years in jail and got a corrupt pardon from Bill Clinton.\nThis is not a benign organization. This -- I can't say yet that we can prove it's a terrorist organization. It's certainly a violent organization, and I believe in the course of time, it will be shown to be a terrorist organization.\nWell, one of the primary persons, Susan Rosenberg, who handles their finances, is a convicted terrorist who was involved with the Black Panthers who used to slaughter police officers. If you read what she's written, she's not terribly far from where she used to be.\nAnd if you read what those other women have written, that whites are horrible, whites are horrendous, whites shouldn't be allowed to have equal rights, they are a racist organization. They are actually participating in hate speech.\nAnd this man, because he went to Cuba on his honeymoon and he fought for the Sandinistas, I mean, this man, we always thought he was a communist but I think he wants to prove it to us.\nCHAFFETZ: Now, Mr. Mayor, New York City used to be a great place for families, for business. What you did with Bernie Kerik and others in reducing crime --\nGIULIANI: I worked really hard.\nCHAFFETZ: yeah.\n(CROSSTALK)\nGIULIANI: -- is going back to the way it was under the -- we have a Democrat mayor. We could say the same thing about Chicago or Philadelphia, can't we?\nChicago is the only city that now has more murders than us. Democrat mayor for 1,000 years, you know? Philadelphia. Baltimore.\nCHAFFETZ: But is it just -- but in New York, is a just Bill de Blasio or what else is going on there? Is it just the mayor taking these radical positions?\nGIULIANI: No, he's got a city council that fell off the left cliff, and is totally insane. I mean, they pass bills that are ridiculous.\nI mean, the man released 8,000 people, prisoners. He and Cuomo passed a bill that you basically can hold people you arrest in jail. The police are completely demoralized.\nToday, he issued a block by block crime reduction program that -- in which he didn't even talk to the police department and the police department's comments on it was no comment.\nSo, we've got -- we've got a mayor who is alienated from the police department, not to mention for other reasons the governor hates him. And then he's putting Black Lives Matter in front of the president's personal residence. The president he wants to go to help bail out New York.\nNow, among other things, not only as a communist but is a stupid one. And the man should be removed by the governor. He should have been removed sometime ago and I believe -- there is no doubt that his incompetence has caused us many, many lives.\nHis ridiculous decisions, his laziness, he doesn't -- he doesn't come to work. He's half hour, an hour, an hour-and-a-half late for everything. There's a lot of suspicions as to why that nobody wants to talk about it.\nCHAFFETZ: Well, this is -- Mr. Mayor --\nGIULIANI: This man -- this man -- this man has in about five weeks destroyed 20 years of work of mine and Mike Bloomberg and Ray Kelly and Bernie Kerik and Howard Safir and Bill Bratton. I mean, we went -- we went, in two years, when I was mayor, from the most dangerous city in America to the safest large city in America and we remained that way until this idiot came along.\nCHAFFETZ: Well, Mr. Mayor, the proof is in the numbers. June of 2020 represented over June of 2019, a 130 percent increase in shootings in New York City. And it doesn't need to be this way.\nMr. Mayor, I wish I had more time with you. I thank you for joining us tonight on \"Hannity.\" Thank you so much for joining us.\nGIULIANI: Anytime.\nCHAFFETZ: All right. Up next, CNN was called out by former staffers, including an ex-producer slamming the network for a lack of self-awareness in the Trump era. Joe Concha, Larry Elder, and Leo Terrell will react.\nAnd then the president's call to reopen schools draws pushback from Democratic governors.\nStay with us.\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\nCHAFFETZ: Welcome back to this special edition of \"Hannity.\"\nThe left is proving to be more hateful and more divisive than ever before, with cancel culture running rampant throughout American society. For the most part, you can avoid cancellation by bending to the liberal mob but if you dare to be a freethinker or worse, conservative, you have a target on your back.\nIf you ask Green New Deal author and socialist sweetheart, AOC, she doesn't even think the phenomenon exists. She tweeted yesterday, quote: Odds are, you're not actually canceled. You're just being challenged. Held accountable, or unlike. Yeah, right.\nGoya Foods is certainly not on light. Their products are staples and kitchens across the country. But liberals will soon be throwing their beans out with the bathwater. The Goya Foods CEO sparked some liberals to call for a boycott after praising President Trump.\nHere's how he responded on \"Fox & Friends\" earlier today.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nROBERT UNANUE, GOYA FOODS CEO: I'm not apologizing for saying, and especially to be called by the president of the United States. You're going to say, no, I'm busy, no thank you. I didn't say that to the Obamas and I didn't say that to President Trump.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nCHAFFETZ: Good for him.\nPresident Trump returned the praise in a tweet aboard Air Force One, writing: I love Goya Foods.\nIt doesn't stop there. CNN's Don Lemon went so far as to lecture actor Terry Crews on what he thinks the Black Lives Matter movement really means. Listen to this.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nTERRY CREWS, ACTOR: When you look at the city of Chicago, there are nine children who died by gun violence, by black on black on gun violence, with -- from June 20th all the way to today. And you're talking about even with the Atlanta child murders, there were 28 kids who died in two years. You're talking about a month. You have nine black kids.\nAnd the Black Lives Matter movement has said nothing.\nDON LEMON, CNN HOST: The Black Lives Matter movement was started because it was talking about police brutality. If you want and all Black Lives ,Matter movement that talks about gun violence in communities, including you know, black communities, then start that movement with that name. But that's not what Black Lives Matter is about.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nCHAFFETZ: Now, you be the judge on that clip, ladies and gentlemen.\nLemon's embarrassing showing even prompted a former CNN staffer to admit the network has taken a turn for the worst in the Trump era.\nJoining me now with reaction, media reporter for \"The Hill\", Joe Concha, Salem Radio nationally syndicated host Larry Elder, and civil rights attorney Leo Terrell.\nGentlemen, thank you so much for joining us here.\nJoe, I want to start with you. You follow, study, right about the media every day. What was your take on that exchange that happened there with Don Lemon?\nJOE CONCHA, MEDIA REPORTER FOR THE HILL: Well, Don Lemon is everything that political journalism has mostly become, that is not to be a curious journalist, asking questions and trying to get to the truth. Instead, it's using their platform to advance a cause or in this case, to be a fifty- something president of the high school debate team in defending Black Lives Matter.\nSo, Don Lemon was actually asked about this in a podcast interview a couple days later, and here's what he had to say, Jason -- my role as a journalist is to speak for my truth and my lens and from where I come from. Remember, this is an anchor saying this -- and I don't think those things or biases.\nLook, that's the very definition of bias. Whose truth, Mr. Lemon? I mean, who we're talking about here? Because your truth is subjective and therefore is something that isn't fact-based, it's something that you are coming from a certain perspective.\nSo, for instance, if you support Black Lives Matter, as clearly Don Lemon does, then you therefore support defining the police. You look at many polls and most Americans don't support that.\nSo, it's not the truth. It's your opinion, and it's an opinion not shared by many Americans that are watching out there.\nCHAFFETZ: Yes, and it's not supposedly an opinion show.\nNow, Larry, I want to -- I want to ask you about this, because I tell you, the Americans interact with from all sorts of races in all parts of the country, they are absolutely fed up and sickened with the idea that supposedly everything they do, like saying the pledge of allegiance, putting their hand over their heart during the pledge of allegiance when they see a building with a flag on it and the city says hey, take it down - - I mean, they are kind of fed up with being told that everything they are doing is wrong, just when they are doing things that are patriotic.\nLARRY ELDER, SALEM RADIO NATIONALLY SYNDICATED HOST: Well, Jason, consider who Don Lemon works for. He works for CNN whose president and CEO, Jeff Zucker, is on a Project Veritas tape conducting his 9:00 meetings literally telling people to ignore news as important and focus on Russia collusion, Russia collusion, Russia collusion. They even got staffers at CNN complaining that Jeff Zucker f-ing tells us what to say to the exclusion of other things they think are important.\nAnd this is an organization back in 1997, 23 years ago, asked black teens and white teens whether race was a major problem in America. They both said yes, but then 89 percent of black teams said racism was either no problem or little problem in my daily life. In fact, more black teams than white teams had failure to take advantage of available opportunities is a bigger problem than racism. That's a \"TIME\"/CNN poll back in 1997 that they conveniently ignored.\nCHAFFETZ: Now, Leo, I've only spoken with you on television I've got to tell you I've got the greatest respect for you. Do you know why? I disagree with you on a lot of stuff but you call balls and strikes the way you see them. Are you telling name that you think the average American, the person who is patriotic and pays her taxes and goes to work and works hard for the kids and family, can they even relate to what the Democrats are talking about with this cancel culture?\n(LAUGHTER)\nLEO TERRELL, CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY: Let me tell you this, the answer is -- the short answer is no. Let me give you an example. I want to go back to the Goya Food situation, if you don't mind.\nThe Democratic playbook is outdated and old. They think people of color and minorities are automatic Democrats. What you saw with Goya Foods in the Hispanic community, Trump might get 50 percent to 60 percent of the Hispanic vote.\nDon Lemon and the situation with that happened the other day, his personal opinion, as Joe was mentioning, Don Lemon doesn't have any working knowledge to give an opinion. He basically indicted Black Lives Matter as some type of extremist organization. It's not a civil rights organization. It's not an organization that helps people. It's an organization that's destructive.\nWhat the Democrats don't realize is that people of color are no longer loyal to the Democrats. They want the freedom, the independence, the self determination which is afforded in the Republican Party. And that's where the Democrats are going to lose in November. Minorities are going to go Republican.\nCHAFFETZ: Yeah, you know what, Democrats I think of taking them for granted for so long. And conservatives need to speak from their heart. They shouldn't give up at all on the compassion card. Show them what they believe in a talk from their heart.\nWe throw stats of people all the time is Republicans. Talk from your heart and explain to you why you love this country and I think Republicans will sweep up come November.\nGentlemen, thank you so much -- thank you so much for joining us. I wish I had more time with all three of you but thank you for joining us.\nAll right, coming up, the left seems to want schools closed indefinitely. But President Trump is pushing for a fall reopening. We'll bring you the very latest straight ahead is this special edition of \"Hannity\" continues.\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\nCHAFFETZ: Welcome back to the special edition of \"Hannity.\"\nThis week, President Trump expressed his desire to get our students back in classrooms this fall. Have a look.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We hope that most schools are going to be open and we don't want people to make political statements or do it for political reasons. They think it's going to be good for them politically so they keep the schools closed. No way.\nSo, we are very much going to put pressure on governors and everybody else to open the schools. To get them open. And it's very important. It's very important for our country. It's very important for the well-being of the student and the parents, so we are going to be putting a lot of pressure on open your schools in the fall.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nCHAFFETZ: Of course, he's already receiving some resistance from liberal governors like Inslee and Whitmer. Today, \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported a new daily record spike in covid-19 cases but there is good news. A German biotech firm is working on a vaccine that may be ready for approval by December. And the antiviral drug remdesivir is receiving encouraging results on COVID-19 patients.\nAnd if you look at your screen right now, President Trump is returning to the White House after a trip to Washington -- to Washington. Joining us now with reaction is FOX News medical contributor, Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, FOX News contributor Rachel Campos-Duffy, and former Florida attorney general, Pam Bondi.\nThank you so much for joining us tonight.\nAs we look at this picture here, that being Marine One. President Trump is returning to Washington after a trip to Florida. I said to Washington, he's coming from Florida there, 9:40 on the East Coast. I would love seeing that Marine come down, this Marine pilot in the way they do business. Rain, snow, whatever it is, they do an amazing job.\nBut the president returning back to Washington, D.C. we like to see him there and being safe as we watch the president exit here.\nWe are going to talk over these pictures here and get onto the discussion about the students and going back to school.\nAnd, Doctor, I want to ask you about this because there is obviously a medical concern but there's also so many other factors like the mental health of the students and they really are in the lowest category of risk, right?\nDR. JANNETT NESHEIWAT, FOX NEWS MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR: Yeah, you're absolutely right, Jason. You know, to the severity of COVID-19 in children is extremely low. The mortality rate under the age of 10 is less than 1 percent, and when a child is growing and their brain is developing, they require social engagement. They require routine and have it, they require an education. It's incontrovertible.\nSo if you have a plan and a protocol in place, safe plan, then you can open. Little steps that you can take. Ensure that the children have temperatures checks. Space out desks. Maybe start out with class every other day.\nWith a protocol and plan on following CDC guidelines, it can be done. It's puzzling to me to see sort of a cognitive dissonance that exists when it shouldn't when it comes to the best interests of our students, of our children. Really need to put them first and look out for their best interests knowing the fact, knowing the science and the data they are less impacted compared to older populations.\nCHAFFETZ: So the president is now back in the White House.\nI want to go to Rachel Campos-Duffy.\nYou've got a wonderful, beautiful family. I've had the pleasure of interacting with them. And you got this like picture-perfect kids. It's amazing.\nBut they need to go back to school, right?\nRACHEL CAMPOS-DUFFY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yeah, they absolutely do. You're right, the doctor is correct. Children need to get back to school. Children are also part of the family and families can't work right now. Millions of families are being thrust into poverty if they can't get back to work because their kids can't go to school. Somebody has to stay home with them.\nThat's not just going to affect the child. It's going to affect the family. It's going to affect our economy. You really can devise a better plan to destroy this country, to thwart our economy from growing and coming back from the terrible virus, then keeping kids home from school.\nAs the doctor said, we know it's manageable. We know children are low risk. They are not super-spreaders, as we once thought at the beginning of this virus. It's manageable.\nIf there is an outbreak we're smart people, we can go back. We can say we're going to stay home for a couple weeks. But to start doing this, it's very clear to me that it's not teachers who are good. It's teachers unions who are filled with activists with a vested interest in seeing Joe Biden win and I believe they are doing this, they are pushing for closure of schools for very political purposes.\nFor those people who might say, Jason, hey, teachers unions care about kids. These are the same people who tried to stop, you know, school choice and poor kids from going to better schools. So spare me that comment.\nCHAFFETZ: Yeah. Pam, I saw something online that made me laugh and giggle for a moment and that is only Donald Trump could get liberals to insist on homeschooling. These people -- no matter what Donald Trump says, they want to go the opposite direction.\nBut the president passionately wants to do this. A president has to make tough decisions, weighing all the factors from medical to the economy to the family.\nPAM BONDI, FORMER FLORIDA ATTORNEY GENERAL: He does. And just as the doctor said, he cares about getting our kids back to school safely, and so does Secretary DeVos. I spoke to her yesterday. And that's what matters.\nSo, yes, we got Joe Biden who wants open borders and closed schools. Then we got these liberal governors that you just mentioned, Inslee in Seattle and Washington state who let Seattle be overrun by these left-wing liberals. Then you've got Governor Whitmer in Michigan who wouldn't even let people go buy gardening tools during the COVID crisis.\nSo I wouldn't trust either of them to decide when our kids to go back to school. And, by the way, Joe Biden wants to do away with charter schools. And President Trump believes that every child, regardless of income, race or zip code, deserves the best education possible.\nCHAFFETZ: Doctor, I guess what I don't understand and I've heard others in my neighborhood talk about this. For the most vulnerable, the older population that has other conditions, other extenuating circumstances, why not do everything we can to lock that down and make sure they don't get exposed to the virus. But for these younger generations, why do we have to treat them the same way we treat somebody who's 85 years old in the nursing home? I don't understand that.\nNESHEIWAT: Yeah, you're exactly right. The phase three openings in the phases, you know, it's not until phase three that the older population of those with underlying comorbidities should engage in the community.\nSo you're absolutely right. Let's focus on those most vulnerable groups, those who have heart disease and kidney disease or lung disease or obesity or diabetes. But we still have to ensure that our younger population are adhering to the CDC guidelines of physical distancing, wear a mask if you can't physical distance. Keep your hands washed and clean. Try to avoid large crowds, especially if there's an area of an outbreak.\nJust taking these simple measures, these common steps -- common sense steps to help protect everyone. But you're absolutely right. Let's focus on the most vulnerable population.\nCHAFFETZ: Yeah, be a good neighbor. Be a good citizen. Wear a mask if you're going into public. You can wash her hands and you can socially distance, America. You can do that.\nThat's not overreaching and government shouldn't be forcing you to do that but you can do it. It's not -- you're going to help America. You're going to help your neighbor feel more comfortable and I think help yourself too.\nSo, ladies, thank you so much for joining us tonight. I wish we had more time, but we've got to keep going because coming up, big development in the quest for justice against deep state abuse. We'll tell you about it, next.\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\nCHAFFETZ: Welcome back to the special edition of \"Hannity.\"\nBreaking tonight: president Trump has commuted Roger Stone's sentence. Meanwhile on Wednesday, a British judge issued a ruling against ex-spy and dossier author Christopher Steele. John Solomon reports the case only strengthens John Durham's probe into FBI misconduct, but this comes amid growing frustration over the lack of progress into the probe.\nJoining us now with their reaction is FOX News legal analyst and author of one of the best books on the topic \"The Russian Hoax\", Gregg Jarrett, attorney Emily Compagno and FOX News contributor John Solomon.\nThank you all three of you for joining us.\nGreg, I want to get right to you. I think was widely anticipated, the president would either commute the sentence of Roger Stone or do something in this case. What's your reaction now that the president has done this?\nGREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST: Look, commuting means he doesn't absolve Roger Stone of convictions but he simply eliminates the 40-month prison sentence.\nHe did it for a couple of reasons. Compassionate, 67-year-old man not in the best of health, about to go to prison on Tuesday, in a prison system that is struggling to stop the spread of COVID-19 virus, especially virulent older Americans.\nBut most of all I think the president really felt as though this was not a fair trial in the District of Columbia. You know, frankly, good luck if you're a friend of Donald Trump trying to get a fair trial there where in the last election, more than 90 percent of the people voted in favor of Hillary Clinton, and a scant 4 percent for Donald Trump.\nIt was underscored by the bias of the jury foreperson which emerged after the trial. She was virulently anti-Trump, communicating social media posts, accusing Trump and his supporters like Roger Stone of being racist, #klanpresident.\nAnd she had a powerful ability to influence and induce the entire jury to have a conviction against Roger Stone. The judge should have granted a new trial but said, oh, gee, it's your lawyer's fault they should have discovered the bias ahead of time. That's an admission that there was bias. He did not get a fair trial.\nCHAFFETZ: Emily, in your perspective, do you think the president made the right decision?\nEMILY COMPAGNO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I think so, and here's why. To echo what Gregg said, it's not a pardon. This is a commutation. So, what is the difference between this and the 8,000 scheduled prisoners to be released in California next week? What's the difference between this and the 16,000 release within four weeks of the national declaration of emergency after the COVID outbreak? This is a 67-year-old man in the facility that he was headed to in Georgia just released report of 20 COVID positive inmates up from zero.\nAnd remember that the DOJ oppose this stay that his returnees had requested.\nSo, in terms of a vulnerable inmate, again, what's the difference between this and the inmates that the left is crying out for being released? And that's why I have issue with Adam Schiff tweeted out for example when he said there's a different criminal justice system clearly for the president's friends. But if you look at it under the eyes of a simple inmate in a commuted sentence who is maintaining and waiting for his appeal, there is no difference.\nAnd final point, the White House articulation of why the president was undergoing this commutation in addition to the point that Gregg raised, they also cited as it became clear that the special counsel, that the investigation would not bear fruit, they, quote, resorted to measures essentially to give the appearance of criminality lurking below the surface. They resorted to process crimes --\nCHAFFETZ: Emily --\nCOMPAGNO: -- of high-profile individuals. And that is so important in the narrative that was pushed here.\nCHAFFETZ: Thank you. John, I want to get to you really quickly. Very short amount of time.\nGive us the latest on what's happening with this dossier, Christopher Steele.\nJOHN SOLOMON, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Listen, if John Durham needs any more evidence that the FBI willfully, knowingly and substantially deceive the FISA court, it came out of London this week. We discovered that on the very first meeting that Christopher Steele had with the FBI where he handed over his dossier, he took notes and guess what he told them. Hillary Clinton was my ultimate client and the FBI never told that to the FISA court.\nThat's a great example of the sort of fraud that went on in this case early on and it's amazing it had to come out of London, not out of Washington.\nCHAFFETZ: Thanks for being on it and we appreciate it.\nMore \"Hannity\" after the break. Don't go away.\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\nCHAFFETZ: If you want to dive deeper and understanding the swamp that is D.C., I recommend my book \"Power Grab\". I also wrote when called \"The Deep State.\" I hope you enjoy both of them.\nYou can find my books, as well as my photography portfolio on my website.\nThanks for joining us on this special edition of \"Hannity\". Sean will be back Monday night. Hope you have a great weekend.\n\"The Ingraham Angle\" is up now.\nContent and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

In less than four weeks, it's skyrocketed to over $2.4 million.\nDC PROTESTERS CONDEMN EMANCIPATION MEMORIAL IN LINCOLN PARK\nAnd The National Bail Fund Network, which essentially serves as a directory for local groups that help disadvantaged people afford bail, has seen its organizations raise more than $75 million in recent weeks, according to a spokesperson. In a three-week period, that spokesperson says, \"many individual bail funds have seen an increase of 100-200 times last year's annual fundraising amount.\"\nSome of the funds associated with the network, having their needs met for the foreseeable future by the outpouring of support, have asked people to stop giving to them and instead give to other causes.\nGoFundMe, the popular fundraising platform, has also been at the center of the movement, connecting the citizens eager to support a cause to the organizations working to change a system they see as unjust.\nA GoFundMe spokesman said that it still doesn't have a number for how much has been donated to racial justice and police reform causes, but \"we've definitely seen an outpouring of support on GoFundMe for a diverse range of causes that are focused on racial justice and equality.\"\nDC MAYOR BOWSER SAYS 'MOB' SHOULD NOT BE DECIDING WHICH STATUES FALL AS PROTESTERS EYE LINCOLN\n\"These fundraisers range from those helping the victims and families of injustice, to those supporting protestors, to those created by and for organizations focused on driving change, to those helping at the community level,\" the spokesman said.\nOne fundraiser has garnered more than $200,000 for Texas State student Gregory Arellano, whose skull was fractured by a rubber bullet during a protest in Austin, Texas, according to the fundraiser's page. Another for a bail fund associated with Black Lives Matter Charleston has pulled in more than $100,000.\nThe money isn't just coming in through GoFundMe, either. ActBlue is an online small-dollar fundraising platform used by Democratic political candidates and organizations, and other progressive groups, which collects a processing fee in exchange for providing a centralized way for these organizations to raise money.\nBetween May 28 and June 26, ActBlue processed approximately $371 million, according to the ticker on its website, for a range of candidates and causes, not just those tied to social justice groups. But while the platform doesn't break down how much went to individual groups, the death of George Floyd on May 25 in Minneapolis police custody appeared to precede an overall surge in donations. By comparison, the site processed $141 million in April and $178 million in May, which was its fifth-highest fundraising month since ActBlue was founded in 2004.\nCOULD BLACK LIVES MATTER GET ON THE BALLOT? \nThe outpouring of support has even helped those who were hurt when protests sometimes turned into riots. One GoFundMe fundraiser raised more than $1 million for a black-owned sports bar in Minneapolis that was first hurt by the coronavirus and then later looted and vandalized in late May.\nBut the fundraising windfall hasn't been without its controversies, either.\nMany people, seeking to support the Black Lives Matter movement, went onto platforms like GoFundMe and gave to the first verified charity with Black Lives Matter in the name that they could find. For many, that was the Black Lives Matter Foundation, a group based out of California whose \"mission is to help survivors and families that have suffered from the loss of a relative or loved one as a result of an unjust or questionable police shooting, and use our unique and creative ideas to help bring the police and the community closer together to save lives.\"\nBut the foundation is not affiliated with the Black Lives Matter Global Network, which is widely recognized as the official central organization for the movement.\nA Buzzfeed story first flagged the distinction. The foundation, for one, is not as aggressive on the issue of overhauling police as the Global Network, which has advocated for reducing funding for police; its official Washington, D.C. chapter has advocated to \"defund\" the police and framed the current moment as \"The Police vs The People.\"\nBLACK LIVES MATTER LEADER STATES IF US 'DOESN'T GIVE US WHAT WE WANT, THEN WE WILL BURN DOWN THE SYSTEM'\nAccording to Buzzfeed, millions had been raised for the Black Lives Matter Foundation, some of which has been frozen by platforms like GoFundMe -- as they consider diverting the funds elsewhere.\n\"GoFundMe utilizes PayPal Giving Fund's database to enable people to fundraise for a charity,\" GoFundMe said in a statement. \"180 campaigns have recently raised money for the Black Lives Matter Foundation, raising $350,000. GoFundMe placed all funds on hold and we are working with PayPal and the campaign organizers to ensure the money raised is transferred to the Black Lives Matter movement via their fiscal sponsor.\"\nFoundation leader Robert Ray Barnes confirmed that he had nothing to do with Black Lives Matter Global Network and said that, despite insinuations he's tried to take advantage of his group's name with donors, he doesn't want anyone's money \"that came to me that did not support the kinds of things that we do.\"\nHe added in a statement to Fox News: \"The overall goal of Black Lives Matter Foundation is to comprehensively improve and elevate the lives of Black and Brown people. We want the public to understand that all of Black life matters and mustn\u2019t be reduced to just Black and Brown interactions with law enforcement... Consequently, when we focus only on the interactions with the police, we lessen the importance and significance of all the other issues that require attention, or that 'matters' as it relates to the overall well-being of members of Black and Brown communities.\"\nThe Buzzfeed story quoted a Black Lives Matter Global Network spokesperson as saying Barnes' organization is \"improperly using our name.\" But Barnes' organization has existed longer than the Black Lives Matter Global Network.\nREPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: ON POLICE REFORM CONGRESS MAY HAVE MISSED ITS 'MOMENT'\nBlack Lives Matter Global Network did not respond to questions sent by Fox News for this report.\nPast IRS documents indicate that the Black Lives Matter Foundation had not spent much of the money it's raised, but Barnes says that more recently he has worked with programs in Los Angeles that help the homeless and the Peaceful Warriors Foundation in Michigan.\nAdditionally, Barnes confirmed reports that he did receive a cease and desist order for his organization from California, and said his group is \"currently working with and is in constant contact with the California Charitable Trust Section to correct the record and differentiate ourselves from the other 'for profit organizations,' which we expect to have resolved in the first couple weeks of July.\"\nThe Black Lives Matter Global Network has not escaped scrutiny. It's not technically a registered charity with the IRS, and therefore raises money through its fiscal sponsor, Thousand Currents. The Washington Examiner reported Thursday that Alicia Garza, a co-founder of the global network, has said that cop-killer Assata Shakur is an inspiration to her. And Susan Rosenberg, who sits on the board of Thousand Currents, has been convicted of domestic terrorism, though was granted clemency by former President Bill Clinton.\nAnd as with any large and unexpected influx of money to such a decentralized set of hands, there is a chance that some of it will be misspent -- though there have been no such allegations related to the rush of cash to activist groups this month.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nFor its part, The National Bail Fund Network says that money donated to its groups will be \"used to bail people out of jail as that is what bail funds do and that was clear when people donated.\"\nIts spokesperson slammed the current pretrial bail system, which it also advocates against on the grounds that it is not fair to disadvantaged populations.\n\"Our current criminal justice system incarcerates hundreds of thousands of people every year for their inability to pay money bail,\" the spokesperson said. \"As long as the pretrial detention and money bail system exist, community bail funds exist to get people free.\""}, {"url": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/black-lives-matter-plans-war-on-police-ny-leader-says", "headline": "Black Lives Matter plans armed 'peace officers' in war on police, NY leader says", "published_date": "2020-06-03", "text": "Protesters take part in a demonstration in Southampton, England, Wednesday, June 3, 2020, over the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers on May 25.

In fact, unless fundamental facts change soon, it could be tough for him to be reelected.\nTRUMP SAYS VIOLENCE IN CHICAGO, BALTIMORE, OTHER US CITIES LIKE 'LIVING IN HELL,' IN 'HANNITY' TOWN HALL\nIf the president does lose, that would mean that just a few months from now, Joe Biden would become the president. The United States government would fall under the control of the radicals who control Joe Biden, and they will remake the country.\nNow, we're fully aware that virtually nobody watching this show wants to hear that, but it's true and key people around the president know that it's true. They've seen the numbers. They're concerned.\nAt some point in the future, historians will marvel at the fact that the president lost ground during a pandemic and then during mass riots. Both crises should have highlighted his strengths. They were naturals for him.\nAlone among national leaders, Donald Trump warned Americans for decades about China and the perils of globalization. Everything about the Wuhan coronavirus proved Donald Trump right. China really is our main global adversary. The Chinese government really does want to take over the world.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\nMeanwhile, the fact that we sent our manufacturing base abroad really has weakened us badly. The most powerful nation on Earth no longer makes antibiotics. Maybe we're not as powerful as we think.\nAll of that is very obvious now after the pandemic, but Donald Trump called it. You'd think voters would reward him for that. You'd think the riots would have increased their support for him.\nAn awful lot of people voted for Donald Trump precisely to avoid a moment like the one we're now in. None of this arrived suddenly; we saw it coming. Social cohesion in America has been eroding for decades. People sensed that; it made them nervous. It should make them nervous.\nDonald Trump seemed like insurance against the consequences of that. The core appeal of Trump was, if things ever started to fall apart, he would defend you. Yes, he was loud and crude. Most bodyguards are. Only a man like Donald Trump was tough enough to fight the creeping authoritarianism of the education cartel in corporate America.\nWhen widespread looting and disorder arrived, the president did not act as decisively as many had hoped. He said little, he did less. Some voters felt undefended, some turned against him.\nIf Trump got elected, you could say what you really believed. The basic promise of America could be restored, you could live with dignity. Under Donald Trump, you wouldn't be forced to mouth the lyrics to some repulsive little orthodoxy you hate. You could declare out loud that all lives matter because all lives do matter. God made us all. And if you can't say that, what's the point of living here?\nDonald Trump never quite articulated any of this in a precise way. He's not an intellectual or an ideologue. But it was obvious, he felt it strongly. Trump's gut-level instincts were on the side of order and tradition and stability, and they still are.\nAnd yet, when widespread looting and disorder arrived, the president did not act as decisively as many had hoped. He said little, he did less. Some voters felt undefended, some turned against him.\nWhy did this happen? Well, there are many reasons.\nTrump was exhausted, for one thing. after three years of defending himself against \"Russiagate,\" the most elaborate and effective hoax in American history, and his staff did not do very much to help. Some of them were actively disloyal. Most were just confused. They definitely were not prepared for Chinese viruses or burning cities.\nBut the administration's main problems were conceptual. Few seemed to understand what was really happening. Their first mistake was forgetting the primary rule of Washington: In an election year, everything that happens is about the election. There are no exceptions to that rule.\nWashington is a political city; it's run by politicians. If the Chinese Navy sailed up the Potomac in the fall of an election year, the first thing most people in D.C. would wonder is, how is that going to affect turnout? That's who they are. It's how they think.\nSo only the naive were surprised when Democratic governors immediately used the coronavirus quarantines to punish people who didn't vote for them. Christian churches and small businesses were locked down. Weed shops and abortion clinics stayed open.\nMost Trump voters seemed not to notice. They accepted the restrictions without question. This was a health crisis, and they wanted to do the right thing. So they obeyed. They cowered in their homes, and that's exactly where Democratic leaders wanted them -- cut off from one another, atomized and alone.\nThe few conservatives who tried to organize resistance to the lockdowns were indicted or threatened with arrest. None of this had anything to do with public health, of course. It was electoral politics, an especially brutal form of it.\nRepublican leaders meanwhile, were remarkably slow to catch on to what was happening. Some of them aren't very bright, but most just couldn't imagine anyone acting with that level of cynicism and ruthlessness. Their good faith made them vulnerable to their opponent's lies. They were used.\nWhat looked like protests were in fact highly effective attacks on Donald Trump's voters, his power base. Few in Washington clearly appreciated this, at least on the right. If they had, they would have told the country what was really happening. No, this is not about George Floyd. It's not about police brutality. It's a power grab by violent extremists.\nIn the days after George Floyd died, these same trends accelerated dramatically. It all happened so fast that it seemed like chaos at the time. But it wasn't chaos. There was design just beneath the surface.\nConsider the targets that the mob chose. Law enforcement, obviously, but not all law enforcement. Local police departments must be eliminated, they said, but the FBI is just fine -- and that was telling.\nThen they claimed that capitalism was the enemy, but only certain kinds of capitalism. The mob burned independent businesses to the ground by the score. They didn't say a word about those businesses' digital competitors, Google and Apple and Amazon. All of those companies were funding the destruction.\nThen the mob told us that traditional Christianity was racist. They desecrated churches in the name of avenging slavery. And yet Antifa did not touch a single mosque, despite the fact that historians say Mohammed owned slaves.\nAs all of this progressed, Democrats continued their lectures about gun control, as they always do, but they ignored the rifles in the hands of their own supporters in downtown Seattle. The real threat, they told us, was rural Americans with their AR-15s. We better get the FBI on that -- arrest more farmers.\nIn other words, what looked like protests were in fact highly effective attacks on Donald Trump's voters, his power base. Few in Washington clearly appreciated this, at least on the right. If they had, they would have told the country what was really happening. No, this is not about George Floyd. It's not about police brutality. It's a power grab by violent extremists. But they didn't understand that.\nSo weeks into the rioting, the social media accounts of the White House were still producing ham-handed posts about Juneteenth. No one was convinced by them, no one was reassured. Instead, many voters were becoming increasingly agitated by the lawlessness they saw all around them. Who is going to protect us from this, they wondered. The social media account did nothing to answer that question.\nWe want to play for you two pieces of tape that help illustrate what life is like for many Americans right now. Neither one of these shows graphic violence. We can easily find tape that does show it -- there's an awful lot of it out there.\nBut what we're going to play instead for you is, in some ways, maybe more insidious than assault. What you'll hear is neglect, and neglect is itself a form of violence. The first tape is from a small town, Fredericksburg, Va. It's a 911 call recorded earlier this month.\nA woman called Tara Durant took her young daughter on errands downtown. As the two tried to drive home, a mob surrounded their vehicle and blocked it from moving. Several people jumped on Durant's car and screamed obscenities at her child. Terrified, Tara Durant called 911. And here's the response she got:\nTara Durant: They are on my car, alright? They are my car right now!\n911 Dispatcher: But we would suggest you slowly drive through the area. Don't hit anyone with your vehicle.\nDurant: I can't. I cannot get out of here, okay?\nDispatcher: Please be patient. I'll let the officers know, okay?\nDurant: Are you serious? You guys have not --\nDispatcher: We can't do anything, ma'am. The city told us that this is a sanctioned event.\nDurant: Get out of my car.! You know, this is going to get dangerous. I've got a kid here.\nDispatcher: Yes, ma'am. We would suggest you call up city hall to let them know about your frustrations.\nDurant: Get out of the way! Get out of the way! This is getting scary. They're on my car! They're on my car! And I've got a little girl in the car crying. Are you kidding me?\n\"They're on my car! They are on my car!\" \"Ma'am,\" comes the reply. \"We would suggest you call up city hall to let them know about your frustrations.\" Those are verbatim quotes. It's hard to listen to that tape without feeling emotional.\nWhat we're living through right now, despite what people have told, you is not a local problem. This is a national crisis. The riots are designed to produce a national result -- the destruction of our system of government and the removal of Donald Trump.\nA woman and her child were terrorized by a violent mob, and then they were intentionally abandoned by the state that has promised to protect them. It was the ultimate betrayal of citizenship.\nYou should know that the mayor of Fredericksburg, Virginia, a woman called Mary Katherine Greenlaw later apologized. But Greenlaw did not apologize to Tara Durant or her young daughter. The mayor apologized to the mob.\nPolice had tried to disperse them while they were rioting. \"I am personally sorry,\" Mayor Greenlaw slobbered. \"I want to apologize to those who went through this fearful experience.\"\nAgain to be crystal clear, Mayor Greenlaw said that to the rioters, not to the citizens she had cruelly abandoned. All of that happened in a little town of 25,000 people. It's happening in so many American towns right now.\nHere's what's happening in our cities. This is a recent video from New York. You will be forgiven if you don't recognize it. It looks like a foreign country.\nAs you watch, notice how the police respond to gunfire being fired in the open. The squad car just rolls on through. The cops don't even slow down. They've been told not to. They don't try to enforce the law. They can't enforce the law.\nKeep in mind, decent people live in that neighborhood. Decent people live in every American neighborhood. How would you feel if you lived there? You'd be very afraid. You'd feel like things were falling apart. More than anything else, you would want someone to restore order. You'd want a leader to take back your neighborhood from armed children because armed children are far more threatening than even the worst rogue cop -- always.\nBut local leaders are not doing that. They are not restoring order. They're ignoring the suffering of their people.\nSo, what is the White House doing about this? Well, the president announced two days ago that anyone who topples a statue on federal property will face 10 years in prison. That is a welcome start.\nWhat we're living through right now, despite what people have told, you is not a local problem. This is a national crisis. The riots are designed to produce a national result -- the destruction of our system of government and the removal of Donald Trump.\nPeople expect a president to respond to a moment like this, to fix it, and they have a right to expect that. The president runs the country. If the rioters were Saudi nationals, it would be very clear that there was nothing local about what we're watching. We would understand immediately that it is terrorism.\nThe president would give a primetime address. Within hours, the feds would be hunting these people down and arresting them. If the rioters were white supremacist, they'd already be in prison facing life.\nWhat seemed awful the other day is normal now. It turns out that if you don't bother to explain precisely why certain ideas are bad -- if you don't  defend your own worldview -- then you lose.\nSo the question is, why isn't the Justice Department responding like this? That's not clear. Some blame the White House Counsel's Office. They say it is dominated by Bush partisans who are hostile to Trump. We don't know if that's true. If it is true, there's an easy solution to it. Just ignore their counsel.\nSend the lawyers to the basement until November and have them reorganize the card catalog, or read Reader's Digest from the 70s. Only a fool lets lawyers make critical decisions anyway. They're not wise. If they were, they probably wouldn't be lawyers.\nOthers say career bureaucrats at DOJ or federal prosecutors in the states are dragging their feet. The attorney general, Bill Barr, says he is overseeing 500 separate investigations into rioters. Good for him. Presumably one of them is into the destruction of the Albert Pike statue in Washington. It took place last Friday. It was on live television. So far, no one has been arrested for it.\nIt would change the course of this country's future if the Justice Department rounded up the leaders of Antifa tomorrow, along with every single person caught on camera torching a building, destroying a monument, defacing a church and put them all in shackles and then frog march them in front of cameras like MS-13 and call them what they actually are -- domestic terrorists. Not protesters, not civil rights activists, not CNN contributors, but domestic terrorists. That would be their new government-approved title.\nOnce they're charged, it's official. In fact, they are literally, as a factual matter, accused terrorists. And that would change minds right away. The people destroying this country are criminals. Few are brave enough to call them that. So, naturally, their popularity grows. Everyone supports protesters. This is America, we believe in protest.\nBut watch what happens when you start calling them what they really are. Most people don't like terrorists. Terrorists will never be popular, even among Democratic voters. So charge them for the crimes they've committed and call them what they are.\nMore from Opinion\nTim Graham: Trump vs. Cuomo comedy duo \u2014 CNN's joke-shaming double standard\nKen Cuccinelli: Police reform and reconciliation \u2013 No more George Floyds. No more Patrick Underwoods\nRep. Lee Zeldin: Defunding police is great for criminals \u2013 bad for crime victims\nRight now, the opposite is happening. The terrorists are more popular than the president of the United States. And not just more popular than Donald Trump personally, but more popular than the system he represents and administers. And it's obvious why. Our system is weak. It refuses to defend itself.\nMayors let new countries sprout in the middle of their cities. Our leaders act like laws are irrelevant. Everyone watches this happen. It's a potentially fatal problem.\nWeak institutions die. Citizens develop contempt for them, and then they get overthrown. The same is true by the way, for heads of state. When you refuse to fight for the system you run, you're done. Spend an hour on Google and see if you can find a single leader in the history of the world who stayed in power after failing to quell a rebellion. You can't.\nThe saddest part of all of this is that our system is very much worth saving. It administers justice more fairly than any system in the world. If we want to keep that system, we have to use that system and that means enforcing America's laws with certainty, enforcing them right now, at the moment of greatest peril.\nIf we don't do it now, we never will do it. Ignore a law long enough and it becomes unenforceable. You'd be shocked if you got pulled over for doing 58 in a 55 mile an hour zone, obviously.\nAntifa's leaders would be shocked if they were arrested for destroying a statue of Abraham Lincoln. Just a month ago destroying statues was a felony. Now, it's allowed. What will we allow a month from now? What will we allow by November?\nThe point is, things change fast, and that includes social standards. They change very quickly, too. Just a few weeks ago, defunding the police sounded like a crackpot idea. Now, it's happening. Millions of Americans support it.\nVideo\nMany Republican officeholders haven't thought very deeply about why this is. Even now, you'll see them grin at the latest insanity from the left. \"Can you believe this? They've gone too far this time,\" they'll say. \"There's going to be a backlash.\"\nReally? When exactly will that backlash arrive? Because the opposite seems to be happening. What seemed awful the other day is normal now. It turns out that if you don't bother to explain precisely why certain ideas are bad -- if you don't  defend your own worldview -- then you lose.\nBad ideas spread. They quickly congeal into conventional wisdom, and then you're done. This is especially true right now, when everything in American life is up for grabs. The lockdowns shuffled the deck completely.\nFour months ago, you'd assume you were going to spend the next 20 years going into an office somewhere. Now, you're working from your couch. You're starting to consider maybe moving to Bozeman, and why wouldn't you? And while we're at it, what else should we do differently?\nNormal people are starting to think like this. Once big things start changing, they tend to change more quickly than we expect. All of this means, this is precisely the time, right now, to defend the institutions that we desperately need to keep in this country.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThose institutions include the nuclear family, our freedom of speech, small independent businesses, absolute colorblindness under the law, the noble tradition of nonviolent protests. Those are the things that make us proud to be Americans. Those are the things that make America a place worth living in.\nWe need to defend these things with everything we have, all of us must defend them, including the president. That is his hope of reelection.\nFor the rest of us, it's our only hope as a country.\nAdapted from Tucker Carlson's monologue from \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" on June 25, 2020.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM TUCKER CARLSON"}, {"url": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/portland-cop-black-lives-matter-protesters-fewer-minorities-than-police", "headline": "Portland cop slams hypocrisy of Black Lives Matter protesters for having fewer minorities than police", "published_date": "2020-07-16", "text": "Portland mayor wants federal officers off streets after protester is seriously injured\n'We do not need or want their help,' Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler says; Jonathan Hunt reports.\nPortland police officer Jakhary Jackson took Black Lives Matter protesters to task last week, calling them hypocritical for having fewer minorities in their \u201cviolent\u201d crowd than the police officers they\u2019re supposedly fighting against.\nThe comments from Jackson appeared on a recorded interview that was released by the Portland Police Department on Wednesday.\n\u201cIt says something when you\u2019re at a Black Lives Matter protest, you have more minorities on the police side than you have in a violent crowd and you have white people screaming at black officers: \u2018You have the biggest nose I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Jackson said.\nJackson acknowledged that he did meet decent people at demonstrations who sincerely wanted to reform police departments for the better.

Tim Scott, R-S.C., balked at calls from many protesters over the past few weeks to defund police departments in the wake of the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.\nScott \u2013 the only African-American Republican in the Senate \u2013 said the calls from Black Lives Matter leaders and other protesters to defund police departments nationwide was \u201cridiculous\u201d and \u201cnot an idea whose time has come.\u201d\n\u201cWhat a ridiculous idea,\u201d Scott said during an interview on \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\u201d \u201cIt should never come... We need order in our streets. And the easiest way to have that is to have a strong presence of character-driven law enforcement officers.\u201d\nCalls to defund police departments have gained traction since the death of Floyd almost two weeks ago in Minneapolis while in police custody. The four police officers involved in the incident have been fired, with one being charged with second-degree murder and the other three charged with aiding in Floyd\u2019s death.\nPOLICE CHIEFS ACROSS US CONDEMN OFFICERS INVOLVED IN GEORGE FLOYD DEATH\nThe death of Floyd has sparked nationwide protests and calls for reforms in police departments. Many activists want the hundreds of millions of dollars that go into police departments from city budgets every year to be diverted to social programs to help minority and low-income communities.\n\"When we talk about defunding the police, what we're saying is 'invest in the resources that our communities need,\u2019\u201d Black Lives Matter co-founder Alicia Garza said Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet The Press.\u201d \u201cWhy can't we start to look at how it is that we reorganize our priorities so people don\u2019t have to be in the streets protesting ... in a global pandemic?\u201d\nVideo\nThe death of Floyd has also highlighted what many say is \u201csystemic racism\u201d within police departments across the U.S.\nScott, however, countered that notion on Sunday \u2013 saying that while African-Americans are more likely to be stopped by police officers, he still thinks the average law enforcement officer is not racist.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\u201cThere's no doubt in my mind that the average law enforcement officer in this nation is not a racist,\u201d Scott said.\nVideo\nHe added: \u201cOne of the reasons why I've proposed legislation that George Floyd, Walter Scott notification is to get law enforcement agencies to report the data on the use of force that leads to death. Without that actual information in the aggregate value, we don't really know what's going on.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.foxnews.com/media/philadelphia-newspaper-editor-resigns-after-buildings-matter-too-headline", "headline": "Philadelphia newspaper editor resigns after \u2018Buildings Matter, Too\u2019 headline", "published_date": "2020-06-07", "text": "Philadelphia orders removal of statue of controversial former Mayor Frank Rizzo\nFrank Rizzo, a Philadelphia police commissioner and mayor in the '60s and '70s, was known for aggressively policing black and gay communities; Jacqui Heinrich reports.\nThe Philadelphia Inquirer\u2019s top editor is resigning after a staff uproar over a \u201cBuildings Matter, Too\u201d headline that ran on an article lamenting damage to businesses amid turbulent protests over the death of George Floyd in police custody, according to reports.\nStan Wischnowski, 58, stepped down Saturday as executive editor at the Inquirer \u2013 one of the country\u2019s most prominent newspapers \u2013 which has struggled as journalism has tried to adapt to the digital age.\nThe day after the headline ran Wischnowski and senior editors posted an apology on the paper\u2019s website, calling it \u201coffensive\u201d and saying it never should have run.\nNY TIMES REVOLT OVER REPUBLICAN OP-ED FORCES PAPER TO BACK DOWN\n\"The headline accompanied a story on the future of Philadelphia\u2019s buildings and civic infrastructure in the aftermath of this week\u2019s protests,\u201d the apology said. \u201cThe headline offensively riffed on the Black Lives Matter movement and suggested an equivalence between the loss of buildings and the lives of black Americans.
