He didn't comply. If he would have complied, that wouldn't have happened.\"\nThe organizer of the Black Lives Matter protest in Franklinville, Daryan Fennal, told CNN she was brought to tears seeing the re-enactment.\n\"I saw mothers trying to cover their children's eyes,\" she told CNN in a statement.\n\"Racism is everywhere, but to put it on display in such a gruesome and public way was what surprised me.\"\nAfter the protesters pass by, the man taking the video then begins commenting on the Black Lives Matter marchers.\n\"Blacks lives matter to no one,\" he is heard saying in the video. \"All lives matter.

The source said that after having \"a conversation\" with his union on Tuesday, DeMarco retained a private attorney. DeMarco was to be interviewed by NJDOC internal affairs on Wednesday morning, according to the source.\nA hearing will be held after internal affairs makes their recommendation and then it will be decided whether DeMarco is suspended with or without pay, the source says.\nMultiple calls by CNN to DeMarco have not been returned.\nLocal union President William Sullivan told CNN the union -- which represents approximately 6,000 correctional police officers in New Jersey -- was made aware of the incident around 12:30 p.m. on Tuesday after \"a lot of officers called in and were upset.\"\n\"We need to continue practicing tolerance and understanding; not discrimination and hate,\" the union said in a statement on their Facebook page. \"As a collective group, we pray for those who are hurting and we are here to help each and every one of them heal.\"\nIn a statement, FedEx said it has fired one employee it it allegedly saw in the video at the protest.\n\"FedEx holds its team members to a high standards of personal conduct, and we do not tolerate the kind of appalling and offensive behavior depicted in this video.

Some personally experienced the sting of police brutality. Some demand things need to change.\nFor their unique motivations, all of them agreed -- this work has become a vital part of who they are.\nHere are three reasons why they still march.\nTo maintain momentum\nTyrell Taylor, pictured center in the red hat, leads Black Lives Matter protests on bikes.\nBefore the pandemic, 22-year-old Tyrell Taylor and 12 of his friends used to get together and do anything they could to stay active. Those meetups came to a screeching halt once New York started shutting down in March.\nTo beat the boredom, they formed a group called MBR, or Mind, Body, Results, for organized bike rides.\nAfter the death of George Floyd, those leisurely rides became acts of protest.\nThe group meets every Friday at 6 p.m. with a few exceptions. They've occupied the Brooklyn Bridge, Washington Square Park and Times Square, among other iconic New York locales. At their largest protest, Taylor and his friends rode with 1,000 cyclists.\nClogging the streets with bikes is both disruptive and peaceful, Taylor, a graduate student at Medaille College, told CNN. Their bikes have become their platforms for anti-racism.\n\"Our main focus is to be a community, a family,\" Taylor said, \"Without that, we're just a bunch of strangers yelling 'Black Lives Matter' and that's not what we want to create, we want people to know and be familiar with what they're going into the protest to achieve.\"\nAt their largest protest, over 1,000 cyclists joined Taylor and his friends.\nThe group's founding members have all experienced dehumanizing encounters with police -- racial profiling, police brutality, stop-and-frisk. Like many Black Lives Matter protesters, they're calling to defund the city's police department. NYPD funding accounts for around 6% of the city's overall budget.\nTaylor has had to cancel protests at times, but the group would come back the following week stronger. Quitting would mean throwing away almost two months of progress, Taylor said\n\"I would say, even if you feel like it's getting repetitive, if you're getting tired of doing it, continue to do it, because they're waiting for you to stop,\" he said. \"And knowing that they're waiting for us to stop, makes us want to go twice as hard.\"\nTaylor said he thinks now the movement for Black lives is peaking.\n\"People are falling off, but it's our job to maintain this peak.\"\nTo be an ally\nWiliam Kilgore has attended protests weekly in St. Petersburg, Florida, since George Floyd's death.\nFlorida native William Kilgore has hardly gone a day without marching for Black lives since protests began in May. He's documented the demonstrations in St. Petersburg, a burgeoning city along the state's Gulf Coast, on Twitter since their inception, and he said he's seen them grow more unified, even if turnout is lower than it was initially.\n\"You have to understand that this is a marathon, not a sprint,\" he told CNN. \"I'd say the focus and organization is actually much stronger than it was on day one.\"\nBlack Lives Matter protests across America continue nearly 2 months after George Floyd's death\nKilgore, who is White, said his community appears to be progressive, but the Black Lives Matter movement has laid bare inequalities in education, income and opportunity within the city.\n\"Racism is still deeply ingrained in every institution of this city,\" he said.\nThe St. Petersburg Police Department showed it was receptive to change this month when it announced it will dispatch social workers to some non-violent calls instead of uniformed officers.\nIt's a start, said Kilgore, who support defunding the police department, but \"not enough to satiate people's thirst for true equality.\" The announcement came around the same time police began to fine protesters for blocking the street.\nFlorida has its hands full with the coronavirus pandemic with nearly 400,000 cases, and St. Petersburg is no exception with over 14,000 of those cases. But Kilgore said attention must continue to be paid to the movement for Black lives.\n\"I plan on staying the course as long as it takes to achieve radical change here in St. Pete,\" he said. \"I am in it for the long haul.\"\nTo disrupt the status quo\nFrederick Edwards Jr. (left) and Jamaal Abegaz march for Black lives in Fargo, North Dakota.\nFargo, North Dakota, didn't have a formal Black Lives Matter chapter until a few days after the death of George Floyd, when four residents coalesced to found the organization's Fargo-Moorhead branch.\nThey've had to become a family fast.\nBefore they joined the Black Lives Matter board, they advocated for Black lives in Fargo in different ways: Kiara Jackson is president of North Dakota State University's Black Student Association, where she met fellow board member and graduate student Frederick Edwards Jr. There's Faith Dixon, who runs a daycare and nonprofit in Fargo, and Jamaal Abegaz works with the local Democratic Socialists group.\nFor their differences in background and age, they're a formidable team. They've led several marches since May 30 in their predominantly White community and met with local officials to plead for change.\nTheir work energizes them. It's also made them targets, they told CNN.\nThey've been told their protests \"make the town look bad.\" Abegaz said he's received death threats.\n\"Just the simple act of saying that things need to change and that we're not going to go along with the status quo puts our lives in harm,\" Abegaz said.\nFaith Dixon (left), Edwards and Kiara Jackson pose at a Juneteenth march planned by Black Lives Matter of Fargo/Moorhead.\nThe violence of the first protest has affected subsequent turnout. The initial march after Floyd's death attracted over 3,000 participants. Now up to 300 people join them, the group told CNN.\nDixon said they've been painted as the enemy, which intimidates residents from joining them.\n\"We are citizens of this community which we love,\" Dixon said. \"I own a business here. Our families are here. Why would we want to see a city we care so much about be ruined ... We're four individuals that have a right to speak and have a right to protest, and why is it such a huge fight just to do that?\"\nAmong their demands are defunding the police, or reallocating some of the police department's budget to social services like education and public health. They want a police oversight board that doesn't include police, and they want new police recruits to complete a college-level course about the cultural diversity of the area. And they've asked police to immediately end their use of force, including the use of tear gas and rubber bullets at protests.\nThe demonstrators will hold as many more protests as it takes for those changes to come, Dixon said. Their work has become a part of who they are.\n\"We're organizing for our lives,\" Abegaz said. \"We have to live, so we're not going to live under somebody's boot.\""}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/21/us/espys-black-lives-matter-opening-spt-trnd/index.html", "headline": "The ESPY Awards make sure viewers know Black Lives Matter", "published_date": "2020-06-22", "text": "(CNN)The 2020 ESPY Awards opened up with a powerful message Sunday.\nSeattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson, US Women's National Team soccer star Megan Rapinoe and WNBA guard Sue Bird were all wearing Black Lives Matter T-shirts.

MLB will continue to listen to the Black community including MLB players, The Players Alliance and MLB and Club staff about this issue; enhance initiatives to improve Black representation in baseball on and off-the-field; expand charitable donations to social justice organizations; and continue to amplify the voices of our players.\"\nThe league has also reversed its policy on messages written on player cleats. According to the document, players will now be able to, \"express themselves with social justice messages and causes,\" during the 2020 season.\nBaseball may have been one of the first professional sports leagues to integrate, but it continues to reckon with the racism of its past.\nFor decades, Major League Baseball owners colluded to prevent the signing of any Black players, who ended up forming their own leagues commonly known as the Negro Leagues. That changed in 1946, when Brooklyn Dodgers owner and general manager Branch Rickey signed Negro Leaguer Jackie Robinson, who became the first Black major leaguer in 1947.\nIn late June, the Minnesota Twins removed a statue honoring Calvin Griffith from outside the team's ballpark.

The night the verdict was set to be announced, Alicia Garza and some friends gathered for drinks.\nNone of them thought Zimmerman would be acquitted on all charges. But that's what happened. And Garza felt like she'd been punched in the gut, she told MSNBC.\nTaking 'Black Lives Matter' from slogan to reality\nThat night Garza woke up in the middle of the night crying. So she began writing out how she felt, in an emotional Facebook post. She wrote that she continued to be surprised \"at how little Black lives matter.\"\n\"That's really what Black Lives Matter was for me,\" Garza told MSNBC. \"And that's why I said Black people, I love you. I love us. And that our lives matter. And that we matter. And that Black lives matter.\"\nThe phrase \"Black lives matter\" inspired Garza's friend, Patrisse Cullors, to create a hashtag. Almost instantly, it went viral.\n\"I wanted it to go viral,\" Cullors, who co-founded Black Lives Matter with Garza and Opal Tometi, told CNN.\n\"On July 15th, 2013 I said that Alicia and I had created a thing called #BlackLivesMatter and we hope that it will be bigger than we can ever imagine,\" Cullors said. \"Over the last seven years we've developed more infrastructure and we've become more organized.\"\nMomentum around the movement has grown amid calls for justice following the deaths of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and George Floyd.\nThe phrase \"Black Lives Matter\" is being used now as more than just a hashtag -- it's a rallying cry. At protests, it's what many demonstrators write on their signs or chant as they march. Online, it's what many have used to spread the message against police brutality. And globally, it's being used by many to show solidarity with Black people.\nWhile many believe the movement is more accepted than it once was, others remain skeptical of what it accomplishes and question its impact.\nHere's what you need to know about the evolution of the movement, and why it matters.\nGrowth of a movement\nBlack Lives Matter is one of the most well-known organizations fighting for the well-being of Black people.\nStudies show that segregation persists in many American cities, leaving majority Black communities behind. BLM's goal, according to its website, is to eradicate anti-Blackness and create a society where Black people are able to thrive in the US.\n\"We live in a country built to keep us away from these resources that we need,\" said Kailee Scales, managing director of the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation.\nScales referenced the data. Police officers are almost four times as likely to use force on Black people than White people. Black people are also jailed at a disproportionate rate. Black Americans have lower access to health care and lack the same access to quality education.\n\"Folks in the movement have been consistently fighting to reverse that trend, to raise awareness that this is not the way we're supposed to live,\" Scales told CNN.\nSince the hashtag launched, the organization has become more formalized, taken on specific branding and branched out into nationwide chapters -- all in an attempt to solidify the group and allow them to create national campaigns while engaging the broader community.\nOrganizers put together a website, which led to the development of local chapters of BLM, first in Los Angeles in 2013 and then throughout the country, according to Scales.\nLeft to right, co-founders of BLM, Opal Tometi, Alicia Garza and Patrisse Cullors appear onstage during The New York Women's Foundation Celebrating Women Breakfast in 2015.\nAfter the protests in Ferguson, Missouri, against police brutality in 2014, the organization became more well known. In 2017 it became incorporated as the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, Inc.\nToday the network consists of 13 official chapters in the US, plus three more in Canada, according to the BLM website. Local chapters are semi-autonomous, meaning they \"do the work that makes sense\" for their communities, Scales said.\nThe structure allows the group to have an impact at all levels -- doing work both nationally and locally, she said. Each chapter works a little differently and has different focuses, depending on community needs.\nThe Chicago chapter, for example, focuses more on police accountability, while the Boston chapter does a lot of activity around mutual aid, Scales said.\nProtests in Los Angeles, after the murder of George Floyd.\nIn Los Angeles BLM activists have been at the forefront of the defund police movement, meeting with local politicians about a proposal they call the People's Budget, which would reallocate funding from the Los Angeles Police Department.\nThe group has called for defunding the police for at least five years, Black Lives Matter Los Angeles co-founder Melina Abdullah told CNN. The most recent push began in May, and at the time the chapter had little support from local politicians.\nAfter George Floyd's killing, however, the group gained momentum and received some support from a few members of the Los Angeles City Council.\nIn June, after pressure from BLMLA and massive protests, the council unanimously approved a measure to develop an unarmed model of crisis response that would replace police officers with community-based responders for nonviolent calls.\nFollowing the vote, City Councilmember Herb Wesson Jr., who authored the motion with Council President Nury Martinez, said in a tweet that he looks \"forward to continuing this work alongside\" BLMLA.\nAnd there is more work to be done, Abdullah said.\n\"(We) never thought that that (amount) was anywhere near enough,\" she told CNN. \"But it's a step forward that we forced.\"\nThe different chapters are bound by a set of guiding principles, which work to ground the individual entities.\nBut they also work together. Chapters tend to work across state lines, Abdullah told CNN. When the BLM chapter in South Bend, Indiana, was getting started, Abdullah said the group worked closely with BLMLA -- specifically comparing notes on the terms of mayors Pete Buttigieg and Eric Garcetti.\nThere's a growing call to defund the police. Here's what it means\nIt's worth noting that not every protest or demonstration is part of the Black Lives Matter network, as some may be organized by people simply using the movement's name. And not every person attending a BLM protest is a part of their local BLM chapter.\nThe movement is largely decentralized, with no one besides managing director Scales receiving pay, said Abdullah, who also works as a professor at California State University in Los Angeles.\nChapters tend to have a loose leadership structure, with a focus on on-the-ground organizing -- allowing chapters the autonomy to organize in the way they see fit.\nUntil George Floyd's death, Abdullah said BLMLA had only raised $100,000 in the last seven years, money that it used for \"the basic cost of organizing,\" things like renting rooms, making copies, printing banners and hiring unarmed security. They also try to provide limited support to families who lose members to police brutality, like aiding with funeral costs, which Abdullah said can sometimes run up to $20,000.\nAnd unless money is earmarked specifically for the local chapters, money donated through the main network goes to the larger global network, Abdullah said. Chapters can ask for a little money from the national organization, but it's not always a significant amount, she said.\nBut with donations streaming in after Floyd's death, BLMLA has more money than it has ever had.\n\"We're stepping back to take a minute and process what we should be doing with the newfound money that we've never had before,\" she said.\n'All Lives Matter' and other backlash\nWith more notoriety comes more scrutiny, and the Black Lives Matter movement has experienced its fair share of criticism.\nSome have said while they support the movement's cause, they are not a fan of its approach, contrasting some of the protests today to the peaceful ones of the civil rights movement of the 1960s.\nMany have condemned the more progressive demands of the cause, most notably the call to defund the police, which would instead invest those funds in communities, especially marginalized ones where much of the policing occurs.\nWhy saying 'All lives matter' misses the big picture\nLike Abdullah said, the call to defund the police has been a key priority of the movement for years. But as these calls increase, police unions across the country have dug in to protect their own -- even though the movement has support from organizations like Amnesty International and video evidence of officers using excessive force against protesters.\nAnd the notion still faces pushback from people on both sides of the political aisle. President Donald Trump has defended the police. Meanwhile, politicians like Gov. Tony Evers of Wisconsin, a Democrat, has said defunding goes too far.\nOthers have called the movement too radical.\nIn Arizona, Rep. Walt Blackman, a Black GOP member of the Arizona Legislature, labeled BLM a \"terrorist organization\" in an interview with Fox News Radio affiliate KFYI. He then told the Arizona Republic in a follow up interview that BLM is an \"ideology that goes against the very concepts and precepts of our principles in the United States.\"\nCritics have also responded to the phrase \"Black Lives Matter\" by coining their own slogans, such as \"All Lives Matter,\" which some argue minimizes the current struggle Black people face against systemic racism, and \"Blue Lives Matter,\" referring to the lives of police.\nTrump previously called the words \"Black Lives Matter\" a \"symbol of hate\" in a tweet criticizing New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio for \"denigrating\" Fifth Avenue in Manhattan with a BLM mural.\nStill, Michael Kazin, who studies social movements at Georgetown University, said it's surprising that the movement hasn't received more backlash. He said it's the first time in history that a movement focused on Black equality has seen this kind of support from White people.\n\"Even in the '60s, with the (March on Washington), polls at the time never had more than 15, 20% support among Whites,\" Kazin, who is also the co-editor of the democratic-socialist publication Dissent Magazine, told CNN.\nThere's been an outpouring of support from diverse populations, he said. He used Portland, Oregon, as an example, where federal officers have used tear gas and force against on majority-White protesters.\n\"We're seeing huge crowds in little cities, or even where there's hardly any Black people,\" Kazin said. \"That's new. That didn't happen in the '60s, or even in 2013.\"\nWhy people are rallying behind BLM\nIt's been said that this moment feels different. It's bigger, more mainstream. White people are protesting just as much as people of color.\nEven large corporations and brands, which may have been silent in the past, are getting involved.\nLast month NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said \"Black Lives Matter\" in an apology video, a far cry from the league's stance during the 2016-17 season, when Colin Kaepernick became increasingly vocal about police brutality to the chagrin of the league. Kaepernick has not been with a team since.\nCompanies like Peloton, Disney, Facebook and others have spoken up against racial injustice, while the CEO of Netflix donated $120 million to historically Black colleges and universities.\nTaylor Swift, who previously stayed away from anything remotely controversial, has voiced her support for the BLM movement, and even called for the removal of Confederate monuments in Tennessee. Meanwhile, Seth Rogen, Steve Carrell and others have donated to bail funds for protesters.\nHide Caption\n37 of 37\nPhotos: Protests across the globe after George Floyd's death\nFrench police clash with protesters during a Black Lives Matter protest in Paris on Saturday, June 13.\nHide Caption\n1 of 37\nWith the rise of social media in the 2010s, images showing police brutality against Black people have reached a much wider audience. Now a whole generation has grown up exposed to the issue of systemic racism.\nOr, as Minneapolis community organizer Shanene Herbert put it, the trauma.\n\"They (young people) have experienced trauma,\" she told CNN. \"Seeing your friends, your families and even yourself harassed by the police and killed by the police, it's traumatic. And they don't know what to do with that.\"\nMore people are demanding change. And BLM has been a big motivator in that shift.\nMary Westbrook, who lives in Philadelphia and participated in the city's protests in June, told CNN that she felt it was important for her to support the movement.\nThe three reasons Black Lives Matter marchers refuse to quit\nWestbrook, who is White, was among a group of demonstrators that was sprayed with tear gas. Afterward, she shared an image of herself on Twitter, noting her \"face and eyes are on fire.\"\n\"I've lived in this city for 16 years,\" the 38-year-old told CNN in a Twitter message in June. \"I am a children's librarian at the library right there on the Parkway (which is why I know the area and streets there really well). I see every day what black and other POC are dealing with in this city.\"\nIn the last seven years, BLM activists have made their message mainstream, according to Marcia Chatelain, author of \"Franchise: The Golden Arches in Black America.\"\n\"There's been a shift in the public and a willingness to engage with their ideas,\" Chatelain, an American studies professor at Georgetown University, told CNN.\nFor example, she said, \"people are willing to take a second to understand what defunding the police and prison abolition are all about.\"\nWhat the future holds\nWhen asked what she hopes for BLM's future, co-founder Cullors said she knows the movement will win.\nThe next Greatest Generation\n\"I know this because our work is full of love, healing and dignity,\" she said. \"And we center Black people's humanity and life over our death and decimation.\"\nThe task isn't an easy one. Kazin, the Georgetown professor, pointed out that the BLM movement is about power -- having power to decide how policing will look, or having power to access quality education.\nBLM signs in windows, anti-racist reading lists -- all these things are good, Kazin said. But unless they are coupled with a true shift in power and larger political solidarity efforts, little will change.\nStill, people are listening now. And Scales, like Cullors, is optimistic.\n\"At this point, we don't stop,\" she said. \"We're not able to relax. It's now the opportunity to push for the true transformation that we've been working for.\"\nCNN's Christina Zdanowicz contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/09/us/trump-tower-black-lives-matter-mural-new-york-trnd/index.html", "headline": "New York City paints Black Lives Matter mural outside Trump Tower in Manhattan", "published_date": "2020-07-09", "text": "(CNN)New York City is painting a Black Lives Matter mural on the street directly outside of Trump Tower in Midtown Manhattan.\nCity employees began painting a stretch of Fifth Avenue, just in front of the Trump Organization's headquarters, on Thursday morning.

This movement has spread on social media, where organizations, brands and individuals are posting solemn messages featuring stark black backgrounds, sometimes tagging the posts with #BlackLivesMatter.\nMusic industry leaders vow to pause business for a day in observation of Blackout Tuesday\nHere's the problem. While these posts may be well-intended, several activists and influencers have pointed out that posting a blank black image with a bunch of tags clogs up critical channels of information and updates. Protests are still raging around the country. Arrests are piling up by the thousands. Visibility for different groups and activist projects are key right now. And one of the most common ways to keep track of all of this is by monitoring or searching tags.\n\"We know that's it no intent to harm but to be frank, this essentially does harm the message,\" mental health advocate and Black Lives Matter activist Kenidra Woods posted on Twitter. \"We use hashtag to keep ppl updated. PLS stop using the hashtag for black images!!\" A video scroll of the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag on Instagram proves her point: It's row after row of black squares, with very few posts of note in between.\nDon't use the #BlackLivesMatter tag, activists say\nThere are two issues here: One, the actual tags used on Blackout Tuesday posts. Two, the actual purpose of posting a black image in the first place.\nWhen you post an image with a tag on, say, Twitter or Instagram, it gets automatically added to a searchable feed, which people can find using that tag. It's a common way for people to monitor a situation or interest. And since people have been including the #BlackLivesMAtter tag, in the words of activist Feminista Jones, the protests have been erased from Instagram.\n\"When you check the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag, it's no longer videos, helpful information, resources, documentation of the injustice, it's rows of black screens,\" music artist Kehlani explained on her Instagram story.\nPeople want to keep the information flowing\n'My emotions were so raw': The people creating art to remember George Floyd\nBlackout Tuesday gained traction from the work of music executives Jamila Thomas and Brianna Agyemang, who led an effort in the music community to pause normal business operations on June 2nd \"in observance of the long-standing racism and inequality that exists from the boardroom to the boulevard.\"\nAs the movement grew, the notion filtered down to individuals and brands who have vowed to not post any content on June 2nd in deference to the situation.\nHowever, there's concern that while what amounts to a virtual moment of silence may be a powerful reminder to some, it comes at a time when the voices of black activists and advocates are needed the most.\nRapper Lil Nas X was critical of the movement on Twitter. \"I just really think this is the time to push as hard as ever,\" he wrote. \"I don't think the movement has ever been this powerful. we don't need to slow it down by posting nothing. we need to spread info and be as loud as ever.\"\nHowever, some people have taken the call to action to mean a pause on posting about personal things or issues unrelated to Black Lives Matter or the ongoing protests rather than complete silence. Some widely shared posts about the day encourage people to refrain from self-promotion and use their presence on various platforms to uplift members of the black community instead."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/07/us/hate-crime-charges-black-lives-matter-mural-painted-over-trnd/index.html", "headline": "Two people are charged with a hate crime for vandalizing a Black Lives Matter mural", "published_date": "2020-07-08", "text": "(CNN)A White man and a White woman who allegedly painted over a California community's Black Lives Matter mural this weekend are each facing a hate crime charge, the Contra Costa County District Attorney's Office said Tuesday.\nDavid Nelson and Nicole Anderson are each charged with three misdemeanor counts, including violation of civil rights, vandalism, and possession of tools to commit vandalism or graffiti, the district attorney's office said in a statement.

We came to a conclusion that it would be detrimental to my personal well-being and my effectiveness here in the US, if I go back to Germany,\" she said.\nThe consequences of an arrest\nA foreign national in the US is allowed to participate in peaceful demonstrations or rallies and if they get arrested, the US criminal justice system ensures that they are entitled to the same constitutional protections as a US citizen.\nHowever, the immigration consequences of the arrest may be quite significant.\nTrump administration temporarily amending visa requirements for foreign workers\nIf they get detained, arrested or charged, it could be problematic, even if the charges were dropped, according to Parisa Karaahmet, an immigration attorney at Fragomen, an immigration law firm. \"They could be asked to disclose the arrest in an application for a visa or at a green card interview in the US for any immigration benefits.\"\nImmigrants like Scheurle are largely aware of how these situations could weigh heavily on their immigration status, which could curb their level of participation and their method of expressing their political opinion.\n\"This is a dilemma that immigrants are facing right now,\" says Andrea Flores, the deputy director of immigration policy for the ACLU. \"So many immigrants want to participate, but the risk is always there. It's important to protest and it's important to stay safe. But the decision is unfair to people who don't have enough protections due to their immigration status.\"\n\"Given the uncertainty that the Trump administration has placed on several visa categories, it's understandable that there is anxiety around participating in protests,\" she adds.\n'We're not breaking any law'\nSeveral immigrants discussed their concerns with CNN but declined to even go on the record for the fear of consequences.\nHowever, not all immigrants are choosing to sit it out.\nPrerna Gupta, an Indian national on a work visa, has been going to protests in her neighborhood in Brooklyn.\nHe applied for a green card. Then the FBI came calling\n\"Nothing is wrong with marching with people. We're not breaking any law,\" she said, adding that the violent protests in the past haven't really discouraged her from going.\n\"It's a thought but not a big enough thought to reconsider going to a protest.\"\nGupta says it's important for her to protest because racism is not just an American problem.\n\"I have been subjected to racism elsewhere in the world as well. When I'm protesting, I'm also protesting for a change globally,\" she said.\nShe has, however, been taking precautions while protesting. Most of it comes from what she's read on the internet, including not bringing her ID along and wearing all black clothes, so she is not easily identifiable.\nWhile Scheurle doesn't want to go to protest in person, she has been helping on the side. She started out by making protest-ready kits for demonstrators. Eventually, she got involved with local groups to help with organizing ground groups for medical attention, setting up supply chains and soliciting donations to get resources in place for helping these protests.\n\"I don't know how real the threat of helping the protests is. There is no blueprint for this and nobody can tell me if this is putting me at risk or not. I am in the grey zone so I'm trying to strike the balance between doing as much as I can and protecting my visa.\"\nUnderstanding the 'special risks'\nDivyansh Kaushik, an international student working towards a Ph.D at Carnegie Mellon University, is also not joining the protests in Pittsburgh. He is scared about the coronavirus pandemic that is still a threat across the country, and being on a student visa just completely puts protesting out of question.\nIf you're planning to take part in protests, know your rights. Read this.\n\"If things turn violent and someone points a finger at you, what would you do? There aren't any legal protections,\" he said. \"I could risk losing my [visa] status.\"\nInstead, as the vice president of external affairs at the university's graduate student assembly, Kaushik has been joining his fellow students in demanding the university adopt more inclusive policies and actions.\nThe concern is not limited to a few. Karaahmet says her law firm is getting a lot of questions from clients around this.\n\"The issues resonate irrespective of nationality or background. They want their voices heard. But they are concerned about their immigration status and want to know the scope of what their participation can look like,\" she said.\n\"A non-US citizen is perfectly entitled to participate, however, there are special risks that they just have to take into account before they make their decision about the activities they want to engage in.\"\n'I have to have these hard conversations'\nProtests are critical to the immigrant community, Flores says, and black immigrants have a stake in it, too.\n\"Because black people are over-policed, that means that additional contacts with the criminal justice system puts black immigrants at increased risk of a violation that jeopardizes their residency in the US,\" she said.\nIf any foreign nationals do find themselves in an encounter with police, a criminal defense lawyer should certainly be their first call and an immigration lawyer should come second, Karaahmet recommends.\nUltimately, Kaushik says, a lot of his decisions hinge on his visa status. \"I just try to err on the side of caution.\"\nAnd Scheurle chooses to think about the people who want her to stay in the US.\n\"I have to have these hard conversations with people around me who want me to stay.

Jackie Lacey will go!\"\nTheir mission has intensified in the wake of George Floyd's death and resulting nationwide protests. But unlike other Black Lives Matter targets -- including police brutality often at the hands of White officers -- their aim is on Los Angeles County's first Black and female district attorney, a homegrown prosecutor raised in South L.A.\nProtesters gather outside Lacey's office in downtown Los Angeles.\n\"They think they're going to sweep all this sh*t under the rug like it never happened,\" shouted Fouzia Almarou, the mother of Kenneth Ross, Jr., who was shot dead by a Gardena police officer in 2018.\n\"I'm here standing tall!\" Almarou yelled from a stage as she turned around to hurl expletives toward the Los Angeles County Hall of Justice, which houses the office of District Attorney Jackie Lacey. Her office had cleared the Gardena police officer of wrongdoing and ruled the shooting was justified.\nOne after another, nearly a dozen parents of dead children took to the microphone to blame Lacey, a Democrat, for what they see as an unwillingness to prosecute police officers.\n\"Killer cops ain't funny!\" the crowd chanted in unison. \"Bye Jackie 2020!\"\n\"It's surreal,\" Lacey said of the weekly protests against her. \"It's almost like an out-of-body experience.\"\nIn her first in-depth interview since Black Lives Matter stepped up its campaign to oust her, Lacey tells CNN she has more in common with protesters than they realize, and that in many of these cases, she's handcuffed by the law.\n\"While you may look at a shooting by an officer and say, 'Oh, they could have shot him in the leg, they didn't have to respond that way,' that's not the test under California law,\" Lacey said. \"The test is when somebody's life is in danger.\"\nStill, the pressure on Lacey since George Floyd's death in Minneapolis has been unrelenting. So much so, that Burbank Congressman Adam Schiff, a high-profile Democrat, pulled his support for her, tweeting that his endorsement of Lacey a year ago no longer \"has the same meaning.\"\n\"I don't know why he pulled his support, but I have heard from electeds that they're being threatened via emails,\" Lacey said. \"People are showing up at electeds' houses late at night, protesting them.\"\nIt happened to Lacey, too. But on that early morning, protesters wound up at gunpoint.\nProtestors take their grievances to Lacey's house\nIt was still dark when Melina Abdullah led a group of protesters to Lacey's home on an early morning in March. It was a bold move, but the co-founder of Black Lives Matter L.A. felt she had little choice.\n\"We've been standing in front of her office, demanding that she meet with us for two and a half years and she refused to come out,\" Abdullah said. \"What alternative is there?\"\nLacey said she has offered to meet in smaller groups after an early town hall-style meeting led to shouting.\n\"When it's a large group, there's no dialogue; it's you yelling at me and hoping that I'll react poorly,\" Lacey said, noting that people film the exchanges with their cell phones.\nThat \"caught on camera\" moment, however, played out at her home, only that it was her husband on the video.\nL.A.'s district attorney's husband pulls gun on protesters. 01:17\n\"Good morning\" Abdullah said to David Lacey, who was pointing a gun at her and others.\n\"Get off of my porch!\" he replied sternly.\n\"Are you going to shoot me?\" Abdullah asked.\n\"I will shoot you, get off of my porch!\" David Lacey said.\n\"I don't care who you are, get off of my porch!\" he replied sternly.\n\"Can you tell Jackie Lacey that we're here?\" Abdullah replied.\n\"I don't care who you are, get off of my porch right now! We're calling the police right now,\" David Lacey said as he closed the door.\nLacey said she didn't know her husband was going to the door, and that the moment felt like \"utter chaos.\"\n\"We were both asleep and I just called 911, I didn't know what was about to happen,\" Lacey said. \"As district attorney, you realize that a lot of people may want to... do away with you because you're prosecuting them.\"\nAt a press conference later that day, Lacey apologized on behalf of her family. She told CNN that coming to her home \"crossed the line.\"\n\"Creating a situation where someone thinks that they're about to be harmed, I don't think that helps your cause at all,\" Lacey said.\nBut Abdullah disagrees, saying \"people have been going to elected officials' houses for decades,\" and that it is all in the quest for social change.\nMelina Abdullah, co-founder of Black Lives Matter Los Angeles, seen in a white shirt, leads a protest in front of Lacey's office on July 1.\n\"She doesn't get to hide just because she lives out in kind of suburbia,\" Abdullah said, arguing that public officials give up some of their privacy when they become public servants.\nThe fundamental disagreement over this issue is indicative of the broader chasm between Lacey's approach to her job and the expectations of protesters. They want stark change to correct what they see as generations of pain brought on by a broken criminal justice system that victimizes people of color.\nLacey doesn't disagree with that, she says, but she views change as something that can occur by fixing the criminal justice system, not dismantling it.\n\"If you're talking about redistributing funds, I absolutely agree with that,\" Lacey said of her view on defunding the police.\n\"I've advocated for mental health funds to go to communities of color since 2013. I've been advocating for treatment of drug addiction for a long time. But if you're talking about, let's just take all the police out of our community and if a crime happens, just let someone else respond, I just don't think that's realistic.\"\nWhile other politicians, including Adam Schiff, marched with protesters in the wake of George Floyd's death, Lacey's refusal to pick up a bullhorn has created the appearance that she hasn't laid bare her true allegiance. Black Lives Matter views her ambitions as \"narrow,\" ineffective and favoring the police.\n\"We wanted to be open to thinking about how can we allow her to be a more progressive district attorney and act in the interests of Black people as a whole,\" Abdullah said of their initial approach to Lacey. \"When you have somebody who is Black, it doesn't always mean they carry the interests of all Black people.\"\n\"They're treating me like 'the man,'\" Lacey said. \"But if they only knew that I'm the girl from the neighborhood.\"\nFrom South L.A. to a seat of power\nLacey grew up in the Crenshaw district of South Los Angeles, born to parents who moved from the South.\n\"They talked to me at an early age about Jim Crow and racism,\" she recalled.\nLacey was born in Los Angeles to parents who moved from the South.\nA graduate of the University of Southern California Law School, her seminal case as a prosecutor was tried in front of famed judge Lance Ito -- an early use of L.A. County's hate crimes law that led to convictions for the beating death of a homeless man.\n\"I actually went to law school to figure out how I could help people who didn't know their rights and didn't know the law,\" Lacey said.\nBecoming L.A.'s first Black DA since the office was formed in 1850 seemed like a win for the community when Lacey took office in 2012.\nLacey, front row, third from right, with an incoming group of prosecutors hired under former D.A. Ira Reiner, center.\n\"I get in here and the most vocal group who wants to take me out is a group known as Black Lives Matter,\" Lacey said.\nIt is opposition the group says is necessary given the current climate.\n\"As a Black woman, I would rather be celebrating other Black women, and I do,\" Abdullah said. \"My allegiance is to Black people, not to an individual Black person who wouldn't mind selling us out.\"\nLacey has a hard time rationalizing that approach. Now 63, she says her upbringing gives her a much different view of Los Angeles than that of younger protesters.\n\"I remember when my parents' home was broken into and they put bars on the window,\" she said, adding that her top priority as a youth was \"just getting home safely\" on her walks to and from Dorsey High School.\n\"People don't realize in the seventies and eighties how dangerous it was in Los Angeles,\" she said. \"I remember when (my parents) used to complain that police don't care about our neighborhood.\"\nThat's why she doesn't take a poisonous view to the institution of policing, she said. But her opponents see her as catering to police, especially since as the district attorney of the largest jurisdiction in the nation, it is her job to potentially prosecute police officers who use excessive force.\nBlack Lives Matter has created \"Jackie Lacey's Seven Deadly Sins,\" a list of what they see as her most egregious affronts to the Black community. They include disproportionately pursuing the death penalty against defendants of color and relying on the testimony of corrupt cops.\nBut number one on that list: Ed Buck, a Democratic political donor and a resident of West Hollywood.\n'How many disadvantaged Black men have to die...?'\nBuck, a White gay man, allegedly invited a Black man to his home for sex and plied him with drugs until his death. The case was fodder for rumor, until he was accused of doing it a second time. That's when activists began to question whether it was criminal.\n\"How many disadvantaged Black men have to die before Jackie Lacey will prosecute this Democratic donor?\" they asked.\n\"I didn't know him. He gave a minuscule amount to my campaign. I think a hundred dollars,\" Lacey said. \"We gave it back.\"\nThen it happened a third time, only this time the man escaped Buck's apartment and called police. Protesters outside Buck's home got their wish -- charges were filed against him, including for battery and administering methamphetamine. Federal charges of distributing meth were added later, for which Buck will face trial next year.\nLacey said she didn't cave to protesters; rather, it took that long for the evidence to fit the law.\n\"When we got that third person who lived, then we were able to file a case,\" Lacey said, arguing that the first two cases were ambiguous.\n\"It reminds me of the John Belushi story. There was a woman who supplied him with drugs, he overdosed, and people wanted the DA to charge her with a crime,\" Lacey said. \"Ed Buck is similar in the sense of here were men who used drugs that Ed Buck supplied, but we don't know whether he injected them or they injected themselves.\"\nThat attention to legal detail offers insight into Lacey's methodical approach to her position. It also explains why Lacey and protesters are fractured over another topic: police shootings.\n'No matter who you have in this job, they still have to follow California law'\nLacey and Black Lives Matter are so far off on the topic of police shootings in Los Angeles County that they can't even agree on how many there have been.\nBlack Lives Matter has compiled a list of more than 600 people killed by police since Lacey took office in 2012. Lacey puts the number at about 340.\nBoth sides agree either number is too many, but Lacey touts another figure she says must be considered: \"14 or 15 of those shootings\" involved citizens who were unarmed, she said.\n\"I can't tell you how many times I'll look at a case on television and say, okay, this is coming my way. Let's see what it's about,\" Lacey said. \"And I open the book and I say, 'Oh, no one mentioned that the guy had a gun, or the woman had a knife.'\"\nAccording to an official tally by her office, Lacey has reviewed 252 fatal shootings through May 2020. One of those cases resulted in charges against an L.A. County sheriff's deputy. The rest were declined.\nLacey said that's because the law leaves her with little wiggle room when a citizen is armed and it can be argued the officer was in danger at the time they pulled the trigger.\nLacey at a news conference on June 29, 2015.\n\"No matter who you have in this job, they still have to follow California law,\" she said.\nBut Black Lives Matter points to Lacey's support from police unions as a reason to be suspicious, since unions are largely seen as an obstacle to effective police reform.\nLacey says she is generally pro-union, which makes her liked by more than just police.\nShe boast nearly 20 endorsements from unions and trade associations, including the L.A. County Federation of Labor.\n\"But they are not in here making the decisions,\" she argues.\nAside from shootings, Lacey said she has still filed charges against 200 police officers or sheriff's deputies for various other on and off-duty behaviors. And her long-stated goal has been to keep people from coming in contact with police, she said.\n\"Why are police called out for a mental health crisis? Shouldn't that be a social worker?\" she asks. \"Why is someone called out if someone is homeless and trespassing? And what can we do to get more people off the streets to discourage people from committing crimes to reduce recidivism?\"\nThose statements may sound similar to those of protesters, but the gap appears too wide for ground to be made up before the November election.\n\"Unless Jackie Lacey were willing to bring charges in all 609 cases of those who were killed by police, yeah, it's too late,\" Abdullah said. \"She has proven over the last seven years who she is.\"\n'My next term will be my last'\nBlack Lives Matter doesn't make endorsements, but their call to oust Lacey can only benefit Lacey's challenger, George Gasc\u00f3n. That's why it's ironic that he's a former Los Angeles police officer and assistant chief, and more recently San Francisco's district attorney.\nBut that doesn't mean he wouldn't face the same scrutiny as Lacey, since Black Lives Matter considers the system ripe for the \"over-criminalization of people of color and poor people.\"\nLacey in 2017.\n\"And so, no matter who occupies the office, there's going to be a problem with the office itself,\" Abdullah said.\nDespite years of protests, Lacey still enjoys broad Democratic support and nearly won a third term outright, getting just shy of the 50% of votes needed to avoid a general election.\nBut that was before George Floyd.\nL.A. mayor Eric Garcetti has left his prior endorsement of Lacey ambiguous, conceding to a criminal justice reform website that \"it may be\" time for a change.\nThough Gasc\u00f3n did not receive the endorsement of San Francisco mayor London Breed, where he served as DA, he has been backed by L.A. County's Democratic party and Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.\nNo matter how the election turns out, Lacey tells CNN \"my next term will be my last.\"\nI think I'm going to care less about what people say and more about... how I want this book to end,\" she said. \"I want to see less juveniles in our... system, less people on the streets.\n\"I don't want it to end like this, right?\" she continued. \"That as the first African American to hold this job, and protesters ran her out. That doesn't seem like a just ending.\"\nClarification: This story has been updated to include George Gasc\u00f3n's political endorsements."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/08/us/girl-black-lives-matter-montana-agitator-trnd/index.html", "headline": "He showed up angry at a Black Lives Matter protest.

In 2013, Bliss created a fundraising video featuring a homeless veteran receiving a makeover.\nIn his latest project, Bliss said he strung together an edited video compilation of what he believes is a raw look and reminder of just how prevalent racism remains in pockets of the country.\n\"There is a fair amount of preaching to the choir in liberal spaces,\" Bliss said.

That, coupled with the fact that it is just outside of the home to the national headquarters of the KKK.\n\"I know that I have privileges and abilities as a White man to go into a nearly all White town and hold this sign without as much fear as a person of color would have,\" he said. \"I think it's important where I have these privileges, I have a responsibility to use them to help lift up other people as well.\"\nAccording to the Southern Poverty Law Center and the KKK, Harrison is home to the national chapter of the group.

The signs included a bedsheet hung across the front window with a quotation from Martin Luther King Jr. saying, \"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.\"\nBut on Sunday, Brown and her husband Dan found a letter from the town of Eastchester between the porch and the side of their house, saying they had to remove the banner or face a fine.\nThe letter, dated June 12, said the family had to take down the banner by the next day, or they could be fined up to a $1,000 per day or be imprisoned for up to a year.\n\"The letter seemed very shady, but I took down the sign and reached out to the town,\" said Brown, who lives in the house with her husband, their son Odin and her mother, Doreen Limato.\nThe Brown family say they've previously put up banners and were never asked to remove them.\n\"I called the cellphone number on the letter, and I emailed him.

If this is true, Brown said, then some of her neighbor's decorations wouldn't be allowed either.\nShe asked several of her neighbors if they've gotten a similar letter, but they told her they haven't. Brown doesn't want to her neighbor's decorations taken down, but wants to be allowed to express her support for what she said is an important cause.\nLimato, who has lived in the neighborhood for more than 45 years, expressed disappointment at the town's request. They've had banners on their house regularly for the last 10 years and were never told to take them down, she said.\n\"I live in America, and I don't have free speech,\" she said. \"It's a very important issue.\"\nWhen asked about why holiday banners of the same size were not asked to be taken down, Colavita said that holiday decorations are allowed since they are temporary.\nColavita told CNN the town board decided Tuesday night to review current sign regulations and will suspend enforcement of banners in the meantime.\nBrown said her family never intended for this situation to become an issue like this.\n\"I'm not doing this to tear the town apart, I was hoping to bring it together.

The jail also implemented new rules regarding proper procedures on how to accommodate inmates with religious headwear.\nLinda Sarsour, a political activist and Muslim woman in New York who also wears a hijab, has been arrested during protests several times. Sarsour said an officer once tried to force her to take off her hijab during the booking process, but she said it seemed mainly to be an issue of a lack of proper training.\n\"For effective police work, it doesn't make sense to ask Muslim women to take off their hijabs. For every way we are identified by the government, whether it's our passports, driver's license, Costco cards, college ID, you name it, this is how we look all the time in public,\" Sarsour told CNN.\n\"It's illogical for police departments to want Muslim women to take off their hijab because that is not the way we show up in the world. The idea of the database is that the mugshot goes in the database, and if you commit a crime again that database is used to identify you. So how are you going to identify us if the way we show up in your database is not how we show up in the rest of the world?\"\nTo force a Muslim woman to remove her hijab for a photo is \"dehumanizing and humiliating and strips you of your dignity,\" she added.\nAn employee at Chicken Express was sent home for refusing to take off her hijab\nThe death of George Floyd, a handcuffed Black man, while in Minneapolis police custody has triggered protests across the country, including the protest where Massri was arrested along with six others.\nAt one point during the protest, police attempted to \"form a skirmish line\" to block protesters from taking over the street, according to an arrest affidavit obtained by CNN. At the time of her arrest, Massri, who says she was rushing to help an injured protester, was confronted by multiple police in riot gear, she said in the petition.\nThe incident report also alleges that Massri hit an officer \"in the right bicep with a closed fist\" after he \"grabbed\" her to escort her out of the street after she refused orders to get out of the road. Massri was charged with battery, resisting an officer with violence and disorderly conduct.\n\"The officer is incorrect. If she unintentionally waved her hand and it made contact, that is not a crime,\" Wahid said.\n\"We are defending her criminal charges, which we strongly believe she committed no battery on a police office and did not intentionally strike the officer.

On Wednesday, the organizers announced they would hold a march in solidarity with Black Lives Matter on June 14 in the Hollywood area.\nThe event has since drawn criticism by local black LGBTQ activists like Ashlee Marie Preston, previously a board member for LA Pride, who in a Facebook video specified there was no coordination between local Black Lives Matter chapter and LA Pride.\n\"Instead of making an attempt to co-opt the moment and cash in on a branding opportunity, they should have reached out to BLM to support actions that BLM is already organizing \u2014 or at least included more community black leadership,\" Preston told CNN.\n\"There's this notion that BLM and LGBTQ culture are worlds apart, but BLM was founded by black queer women.

In 1917, nearly 10,000 demonstrators in New York City wore white as they participated in the NAACP's Silent Protest Parade, one of the first public demonstrations of civil rights by black Americans.\n\"We felt that was a really powerful way to think about our action in relation to a lot of others and how thinking on the metaphor of like silence equals death and how everything comes together,\" Tirado, a queer writer and producer, told CNN.\n\"In the 1917 Silent Parade the men wore black while women and children wore white,\" co-organizer West Dakota explained in a statement following the protest. \"The decision to wear white was to symbolize our unity, and also to take a stand against corporate appropriation of the rainbow flag. We don't need rainbow (merchandise) to show our pride.\"\nThe role of organizer in times of civil unrest has most often been filled by the same black and brown people who themselves are facing violence and mistreatment, Tirado said.\nIt was important to Sunday's organizers -- a group made up primarily of queer people of color, both black and non-black -- that the legwork of organizing be done by non-trans folks, while keeping the spotlight on the partnering trans activists and organizations.\n\"This collective of folks is particularly powerful because it's modeling what is possible when you do have allies and folks who do care and also want to make sure that they're building something that speaks to the hearts of the actual people that they're representing,\" Willis told CNN in an interview. \"So often that doesn't happen.\"\nMelania Brown, the sister of Layleen Polanco, was among the speakers at the New York rally on Sunday.

Ninety-one percent of the reported murders of trans and gender non-conforming people in 2019 were black women, and 81% were under the age of 30, according to the Human Rights Campaign, which tracks reported killings.\nViolence against the transgender community often goes unreported or misreported, as a result of authorities, media reports, and family members misidentifying the dead, the Human Rights Campaign said.\nLGBTQ communities are elevating black voices during Pride Month in solidarity\nDeadnaming is the term used to refer to the use of a trans person's birth name in place of their chosen name, as has been the case for Riah Milton, who was deadnamed and misgendered by the Butler County Sheriff's Office in a press conference last Thursday.

Among those supporters was Mark Mosley, who told CNN his kids joke that he's the only black man on the south side of Chicago who likes NASCAR.\nMosley admitted he's struggled with his love of the sport. Over the years, Mosley said he's probably taken 10 friends to Chicagoland Speedway, hoping to convince them they could like NASCAR, too.\n\"None of them wanted to return because of the environment,\" he said. \"Half of them left halfway through the race.\"\nStatue removals show change is coming \u2014 even in the capital of the Confederacy\nWhen former driver Richard Petty \u2014 Mosley's \"idol\" growing up \u2014 came out against kneeling during the National Anthem, Mosley said it was like a dagger to the heart. He decided to stop watching altogether after driver Kyle Larson used the n-word in a virtual racing event in April. \"I gave up on NASCAR, to be honest.\"\nBut he changed his mind this week.\n\"I was elated, excited, happy, any positive adjective or adverb you can think of,\" he said of the flag ban. \"It meant the world to me as an African American NASCAR fan.\"\nAnother fan, Alex Burns, said he felt alienated from the rest of the fan base at times.\nWalking around a track or in the campgrounds, Burns said he kept his \"head on the swivel,\" avoiding campsites where people were drinking and flying the Confederate flag.\nWhile that feeling never deterred Burns from enjoying the sport, he said he's \"very proud of NASCAR\" for banning the flag.\n\"I'm even more of a fan of NASCAR,\" he said, adding later, \"I just hope people understand that, you know, it's time for change.\"\n'There aren't a lot of people who look like me'\nBrehanna Daniels \u2014 the first black woman to pit in a NASCAR national series race \u2014 also supports the flag ban.\n\"I'm very proud of NASCAR right now,\" Daniels told CNN in an interview. \"We're moving on up the ladder. We're taking baby steps but we're changing things for the better.\"\nDaniels was nervous when she first became a NASCAR tire changer through the Drive for Diversity program, which aims to bring more minorities and women into the NASCAR fold.\n\"There aren't a lot of people who look like me,\" Daniels said. \"It's a beautiful thing when you see multiple faces \u2014 like in the NBA and the NFL there's people of different races, ethnicities. I like seeing diversity, and in NASCAR you really don't see much of that.\"\nBrehanna Daniels, tire changer on the #52 Winn Dixie Chevrolet, watches from pit road at the 61st Daytona 500 in Daytona Beach, Florida, on February 17, 2019.\nSo for Daniels, the steps taken this week are \"meaningful changes.\"\n\"It honestly meant a lot,\" she told CNN, wiping away tears. \"Because it's hard being black, y'all.\" She pointed to the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, saying \"nobody deserves to die like that.\"\n\"I applaud NASCAR for finally realizing that things need to change for the better,\" she said. \"I will always be behind them because of that.\"\nFlag represents division, not history, fans say\nNot everyone agreed the flag ban was the right decision.\n\"You're getting both sides, a lot of positive outreach and gaining new fans as we go,\" Bubba Wallace told CNN's Don Lemon. \"Then you got your fans who will never watch NASCAR again, the same fans who will never watch the NFL after the kneeling, the same fans that were crying out that we're ruining their lives and just throwing a pity party.\"\nNASCAR truck racer Ray Ciccarelli says he's quitting over the company's decision to ban the Confederate flag\nOne high-profile detractor was Ray Ciccarelli, a part-time driver in the NASCAR Gander RV & Outdoors Truck Series, who announced he would quit at the end of this season, writing in a statement, \"I don't believe in kneeling during Anthem nor taken ppl right to fly what ever flag they love.\"\n\"I could care less about the Confederate Flag,\" he added, \"but there are ppl that do and it doesn't make them a racist.\"\nOther fans spoke out on social media, insisting the flag was about history or Southern \"heritage,\" not a symbol of racism.\nAndria Renee Phillips, an African American fan since the early 2000s, said it didn't really bother her when she saw the flag at NASCAR events, agreeing it was \"a part of history\" \u2014 though she said it was \"painful, no matter how you look at it.\"\n\"I feel like the flag is a reminder of what was,\" she said, \"but then there's different perspectives on the flag ... It has memories for people. Good, bad, whatever it may be.\"\nConfederate flags flying over the infield campground before start of the NASCAR Southern 500 at Darlington Raceway on September 6, 2015, in Darlington, South Carolina.\nBut to Daniels, the Confederate flag represents \"division.\"\n\"And that's not what we want,\" she said. \"We're more about togetherness and not being divided. I'm behind NASCAR all the way, but I felt that was dividing us.\"\nBurns told CNN that while the flag may be part of history, it represents \"a bad time in history where we as black people were enslaved.\"\n\"In terms of history, \" Mosley said, \"history has proven that blacks have always been mistreated. So historically speaking, to me, (the Confederate flag) represents hate.\"\n'We're being listened to'\nA big part of the NASCAR experience is hanging out at campsites within the track's infield leading up to a race, Wiley said. But whenever he saw the Confederate flag flying at a campsite, \"it was an indication to me of like, I don't know what these people are about.\"\nBubba Wallace says there's more good than bad in fan reaction to NASCAR's Confederate flag ban\n\"You want to be part of this whole big family atmosphere,\" he said. \"But at the same time it's like, I don't know if I'm welcome here.\"\nOver the years, as he became more aware of social issues like police brutality, Wiley felt NASCAR failed to reach out to black fans. Even as the Black Lives Matter movement grew, Wiley said, \"NASCAR was still very much on the side of, 'Blue Lives Matter, we support our law enforcement, we support the military,' everything else.\"\n\"I didn't mind them saying we support law enforcement,\" he said. \"But at the same time, to completely ignore the other side of the argument was kind of insulting to me.\"\nIn 2015, after nine black churchgoers were massacred at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, NASCAR issued a statement saying it would continue \"to disallow use of the Confederate Flag symbol in any officials NASCAR capacity.\" But it stopped short of an outright ban, and Wiley wondered if it would ever happen.\nBut he felt NASCAR had no choice. In recent years, NASCAR has dealt with a narrative of declining viewership and attendance. Without efforts to be more inclusive, Wiley felt \"they're not going to make it.\"\n\"There aren't enough people who still believe in this to sustain it.\"\nBubba Wallace with his Black Lives Matter car before the start of a NASCAR Cup Series race in Martinsville, Virginia, on June 10, 2020.\nThat's why black NASCAR fans are excited. They hope this change will help attract more black and brown fans to the sport.\nFor Wiley, the ban and Wallace's Black Lives Matter paint scheme were \"one of the most uplifting things\" for a fan who's felt disconnected from NASCAR for a long time.\n\"We're accepted and we're being listened to \u2014 in this space,\" he said. \"Finally.\"\n\"NASCAR needs more diversity,\" Daniels said. \"And with the recent things that have happened, a lot of minorities are saying, 'Hey, when's the next race? I'm trying to come.'\"\n\"With more of that,\" she said, \"NASCAR will have a bigger audience, a bigger crowd.\"\nOne day, Daniels hopes she'll look up from the pit road and see a sea of diverse faces looking back at her.\n\"That would be a sight to see, wouldn't it?\"\nCNN's Steve Almasy, Katherine Jennings, Allen Kim, Keith O'Shea and Amir Vera contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/07/us/philadelphia-inquirer-executive-editor-steps-down/index.html", "headline": "The executive editor of the Philadelphia Inquirer has stepped down after publishing 'Buildings Matter, Too' headline", "published_date": "2020-06-07", "text": "(CNN)The top editor of the Philadelphia Inquirer has stepped down from his role after the newspaper published an article with the headline \"Buildings Matter, Too,\" last week, according to an internal memo sent to newsroom staff and obtained by CNN.\nStan Wischnowski, has worked for the Inquirer for 20 years and has been its executive editor for a decade, according to the memo from publisher Lisa Hughes.

I feel that anger.\"\nHis emotions, though, soon turned to unease when he saw some protests over Floyd's death spiral into violence. It all seemed like a replay of the 1960s race riots, which he believes tipped the 1968 presidential election to Richard Nixon, who ran as a law-and-order candidate.\nWasow says his research shows that violent, black-led protests in the 1960s reduced white support for civil rights.

Black leaders are clashing about tactics, history and even shared heroes. And lurking underneath much of these discussions is a growing sense of despair.\nSome are arguing nonviolent protest has not worked for black people\nThere can't be a racially charged protest without someone quoting the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., whose acts of nonviolent resistance drove much of the civil rights movement.\nAs some of the recent protests turned violent, King became a shadow commentator. Critics of the violence quoted King's take on a notorious racist politician of his era: \"Every time a riot develops, it helps George Wallace.\"\nA man is carried away by police during riots in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1968.\nCongressman John Lewis, the civil rights icon, released a recent statement saying he could relate to protesters' anger and despair, but that they should be \"constructive, not destructive.\"\nPresident Obama also has condemned the violence that broke out at some protests.

Violence.\"\nOthers, though, say nonviolent protests were vital to the success of the movement.\n\"How are you telling me that the Montgomery Bus Boycott -- 381 days of people walking miles to work -- that it didn't break the back of bus segregation?\" says Wasow, the Princeton political scientist.\n\"Selma, the March on Washington, the lunch counter sit-ins -- that didn't work?\" he adds. \"The civil rights movement broke Jim Crow. That is an unbelievable accomplishment and it did it primarily through nonviolent means.\"\nOne can also cite a more recent example.

There's research to suggest these fears are not unfounded.\nWasow, the Princeton professor, published a research paper that examined the impact of media coverage of violent protests that followed King's 1968 assassination in places like Illinois, Ohio and New Jersey. He examined more than 275,000 newspaper headlines to see how media framing of the protests shaped public opinion.\nPolls showed that nonviolent protests increased white support for civil rights, while violent protests did just the opposite, he says.\nA soldier stands guard in Washington near buildings that were destroyed in the riots that followed the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. in April 1968.\nThat shift was enough to hand the White house to Nixon, who had pitched his campaign to the \"silent majority\" of Americans who were not out in the streets.\nWasow believes images of black protesters burning buildings and looting stores reinforced a preexisting narrative in American history about black people being inherently criminal.\n\"That is a story about black people that the media has been telling for hundreds of years,\" he says. \"That script is readily available to the American public, to news reporters, and it's an easy groove for the media to slip into.\"\nThat script is so ingrained in the American psyche that even peaceful protests for racial justice provoke white anxiety, other research suggests.\nAnother scholar said in a recent research paper that Trump's vocal support for police during his presidential campaign in 2016 helped gain him the support of white voters who were anxious about the social changes being proposed by Black Lives Matter protesters.\nDemonstrators raise their arms as they protest the shooting death of Michael Brown on August 17, 2014 in Ferguson, Missouri.\nWhile many Black Lives Matter protests were peaceful, others turned violent, especially after a white police officer shot and killed Michael Brown, an unarmed black man, in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014.\nNew images of black protesters looting and burning buildings could trigger anxiety among white voters who are already uneasy about the changing demographics in America, says Kevin Drakulich, the paper's lead researcher and an associate professor of criminal justice at Northeastern University in Boston.\n\"That tends to fit with their views of resisting those changes on the basis of black Americans not being deserving,\" he says. \"It's proof in their minds of their undeserving nature.\"\nSome wonder if protests will ever change anything\nThe videos of black people dying at the hands of law enforcement keep coming. And how these people were acting before they died doesn't seem to matter, says Price, the political scientist at Prairie View A&M.\n\"What we've learned from the George Floyd video is that when you're compliant, when you're not causing trouble, when you have good control of your emotions -- you still die,\" she says.\nPrice also alluded to other recent incidents, including the fatal Ahmaud Arbery shooting and the death of Breonna Taylor, a Louisville EMT who was shot while she was sleeping during a police raid of her home.\nGeorge Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor, from left.\n\"If there's violence, there's racism.

One evangelical magazine, Christianity Today, called for a church-led reparations project.\nBut even as they appreciate the scales falling from some White Christians' eyes, some Black Christians remain wary.\nTrillia Newbell says her faith has been tested by people who make racist comments.\nThat's especially true of those like Newbell who have spent significant time in predominantly White spaces.

In the past, she's been told her interracial marriage is an affront to God, witnessed frustrated Black friends leave predominantly White churches, and -- too many times to count -- been expected to prove that anti-Black racism persists in America.\n\"It is so detrimental to someone's faith when your experience, your reality, is squashed because it's not the other person's reality,\" Newbell said. \"I have experienced that time and time again.\"\nThe sermon problem\nSunday morning has long been known as the \"segregated hour\" in American religious life, when many Black and White Christians worship the same God in separate sanctuaries.\nSome of the division may derive from the pastor's pulpit, according to recent public opinion surveys.\nMore than 6 in 10 Black Christians say it's important for sermons to address topics like racial relations and immigration, according to a recent Pew Research Center study. (Nearly a quarter called it \"essential.\")\nWhite Americans did not agree: More than 6 in 10 said those topics are not essential for pastor to examine, with 40% insisting that race and immigration should not be mentioned at all at church.\nPew's survey was conducted before Floyd's killing made international news and sparked nationwide protests. But Black Christians have been raising alarms about police brutality and systemic racism for decades.\nPastor Joel Osteen joins a march in honor of George Floyd on June 2, 2020, in Houston, Texas.\nAs recently as last summer, only 35% of White Christians said they were motivated to address racial injustice; and less than 2 in 5 believed the United States has a race problem, according to a 2019 poll by the Barna Research Group, a Christian public opinion firm based in California.\nMichael Emerson, a sociologist at the University of Illinois at Chicago, helped conduct that survey and is co-author of \"Divided by Faith,\" one of the most comprehensive surveys on race and religion in America.\n\"The racial gaps are huge on diagnosing the problem (of racism) and determining what we should do,\" he told CNN. \"There are even huge gaps on understanding what racism is and whether it's individual or systemic.\"\nSome of those gaps might have narrowed since Floyd's death. But, as some evangelicals acknowledge, that is not the only problem.\nThe theology problem\nLast month, the National Association of Evangelicals put together resources for churches and pastors to respond to racial injustice and encouraged its members to \"combat attitudes and systems that perpetuate racism.\"\nIt wasn't the first time the NAE, which represents some 45,000 local churches, has addressed systemic racism, said the Rev. Walter Kim, the association's president.\nAppointed last October, Kim is a Korean American and the first person of color to lead the NAE. He said he sees a broader, more active swath of evangelicals engaged on race in recent weeks.\nBut he also acknowledges that evangelicals haven't always been willing to address their racial history or see the wider repercussions of contemporary racism.\n\"There are streams of evangelicalism in which the issue of race has been woefully and inadequately addressed,\" Kim said.\nWalter Kim, president of the National Association of Evangelicals.\nEvangelicalism itself began as a spiritual renewal movement, with a primary focus on saving souls and fostering deeply personal encounters with Christ. Often, larger societal problems are seen as spiritual issues that can only be solved by salvation.\n\"The outworking of evangelicalism's public theology needs to catch up to its understanding of personal transformation,\" Kim said.\nBut like other evangelicals, Kim believes the wind has shifted since Floyd's killing.\n\"When America saw the death of George Floyd with their own eyes on a video played millions of times, it changed something,\" said Ronnie Floyd, a former Arkansas pastor who now heads the Southern Baptist Convention's executive committee.\n\"I really believe it will be a watershed moment for this country.\"\nFloyd, a longtime advocate of racial reconciliation, noted Southern Baptists' public apology in 1995 for its history of slaveowning and said there are a wide variety of views on race among Baptists.

Absolutely,\" Floyd continued. \"Are we making progress? Yes.\"\nBut there are caveats. Emerson noted that only 1% of White Christians worship in a racially mixed or predominantly African American church.\nNearly all of the increase in diverse congregations has been a result of Black and Latino Christians worshipping at predominantly White Churches -- where they haven't always had positive experiences.\nThe 'whitelash' problem\nJemar Tisby, author of \"The Color of Compromise,\" a book about White churches' complicity in racism, calls himself \"post-evangelical.\"\nThe Black Christian historian, who left his predominantly White denomination years ago, said he receives several messages per week from Christians looking to follow in his footsteps.\nHe says many write him after their White pastors minimize or try to explain away devastating incidents of anti-Black police brutality. They ask Tisby, should they leave?\n\"We are telling them to get out,\" he said. \"Especially at this moment, if your churches are not taking a strong stand on racial justice it's unlikely they ever will.\"\nEven when White churches say they are committed to addressing racism, their attention can be fleeting, said Dant\u00e9 Stewart, a writer and preacher in Augusta, Georgia.\nAn Easter sunrise service at Red Rocks Amphitheatre on April 21, 2019, in Morrison, Colorado.\nStewart, who was raised in Black churches, said he became immersed in White evangelicalism while playing football at Clemson University. After school, he and his wife worshipped at predominantly White churches.\nStewart said he was welcomed warmly -- until he started preaching about race. One church, which he declined to name, rescinded its offer to hire him as a pastor.\n\"Stew, you are making too much about race right now,\" he recalls one church leader saying. At the time, Stewart was writing articles in prominent evangelical magazines and being asked to speak on panels. But his church didn't want to hear about it.\nIt was a painful and exasperating experience, Stewart said.\n\"It was exhausting to stay in a White evangelical space,\" he said. \"They may have been around me, but they didn't love me and wouldn't fight for me. That's when I knew I had to leave and return to the Black church.\"\nKristina Brown Button, an author and advocate for racial justice, describes a similar sojourn through White Christianity.\nA mother of five who lives in Virginia, Button said she searched for 20 years to find a congregation and pastor who would make race and racism a top priority.\nShe recalls being the first Black member of her former church in Virginia Beach, which she joined with her future husband 20 years ago. There, Button said she endured years of isolation.\nWhite men addressed her White husband but failed to acknowledge her. Pastors proclaimed deep sadness about racism but were quick to move on to other issues, even after the shootings of Black men like Michael Brown demanded deeper responses.\nButton said she is heartened by what she hears now from White Christians. But experience has taught her that White Christians often balk when discussions get difficult and pastors dread offending White congregants.\n\"It's so rare to see White Christians stick with it unless they have a personal stake,\" Button said. \"I am not going to a predominantly White church again. It was just too painful.\"\nPastor Jevon Washington: \"This is the first time I am seeing White Christians responding in they way they have now.\"\nEven Black pastors said they have trouble engaging White Christians on race. Congregations are more than willing to tackle issues like homelessness and abortion, but racism is often deemed too \"political\" to touch, said Pastor Jevon Washington.\n\"Honestly, the church has been the worst when it comes to dealing with some of these things,\" said Washington, who worked at several predominantly White churches before settling in Rainier Valley in Washington. \"They just don't get it.\"\nSince Floyd's killing, more White Christians are joining the \"woke party,\" Washington said. But they are tardy and inconsistent allies.\n\"This is the first time I am seeing White Christians responding in the way they have now,\" said the pastor. \"But I am deeply saddened that it took a man getting murdered before their eyes to see the problem.\"\nThe Trump problem\nWhen 81% of White evangelicals voted for Donald Trump for president in 2016, some Black Christians viewed it as a betrayal.\n\"When presented with a choice between loving their black neighbors and supporting White supremacy, White Christians chose White power,\" said Stewart.\nIt's more complicated than that, White Christians have protested, arguing that there were many reasons to support Trump over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.\nThe Rev. Albert Mohler Jr., president of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, speaks to reporters in 2015.\n\"The disruption of our political system is not entirely attributable to Trump,\" said Albert Mohler, an influential Southern Baptist and president of the SBC's flagship seminary.\nMohler opposed Trump in 2016 but has said he will vote for the president in November. Evangelicals' political priorities should be abortion, adding conservative justices to the Supreme Court and protecting religious freedom, he said.\nThat's precisely the problem, say Black Christians. Challenging Trump's racial divisiveness is not a priority for too many White Christians, they say.\nFloyd, the head of Southern Baptists' executive committee, has also served on Trump's informal board of evangelical advisers. He said some evangelical leaders have called the White House to register objections \"when certain things happen that are not right.\"\n\"I don't think White evangelicals have been totally silent,\" he said, although he declined to offer specifics. \"Should they have been louder? Probably so.\"\nBut Floyd, who pastored a church for 35 years, said many local pastors are simply overwhelmed and often don't know enough to address difficult topics like racism.\nPresident Donald Trump holds up a Bible outside of St John's Episcopal church across Lafayette Park in Washington on June 1, 2020.\nThere's also the fact that when White Christians look at their congregations, they see a lot of Trump voters. According to a recent Pew poll, 8 in 10 White evangelicals said they would vote for him again.\nMeanwhile, nearly nine in 10 Black Americans do not think the president \"cares about people like you,\" according to a Fox News poll from last month.\nAnd therein lies perhaps the steepest obstacle to racial reconciliation.\nSome Black Christians have laid down a marker, saying that if White Christians vote for Trump in large numbers again, racial relations in this country may be irreparably harmed.\n\"If they have made all of these gestures in the wake of George Floyd's murder, only to go back to voting for a man who embodies racial bigotry,\" said Tisby, the historian, \"it will do more damage than if they had just remained silent.\"\nGeorge Floyd's death was a moment of racial reckoning for many White Christians. The presidential election in November will provide another.\nBlack Christians will be paying close attention."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/20/us/tulsa-trump-rally-tension/index.html", "headline": "For Black Tulsa residents, the city's racial past and present hover over Trump rally", "published_date": "2020-06-20", "text": "(CNN)A group of young Black men stands at attention.

They believe this devalues the Black Lives Matter movement, and they say they will be vigilant for potential trouble as President Trump descends on their city. While the movement is not armed, Oklahoma residents have the right to carry arms. However, they say that is only out of a need for self-defense.\n\"They're so much more peaceful than what society and media would have you believe,\" Robinson said, referring to the group. \"They want an education, they want economic opportunity.

Police body-cam footage and eyewitness cell phone video show some of the interaction between the officers and the teens.\nIn a video shot by a bystander, one of the officers is seen leaning into his police car where he had placed one of the handcuffed teens. After a few seconds, the officer is seen kicking into the car. Moments later, that officer throws the handcuffed teen out of the car and onto the sidewalk.\nIn police dash camera video released by the Tulsa Police Department, an officer can be seen searching the pocket of the teen who had been put in the front seat of the police car. A few minutes later, the officer can be seen kicking his legs as the teen struggles.\nAlthough the boys were eventually released, and the Tulsa Police Department announced an investigation, the lasting emotional trauma of incidents like this one often runs deeper than some realize, Robinson says.\nThese Tulsa natives are following in the footsteps of the Black Panther movement\n\"A white boy wakes up and says, 'What do I want to do today?' And a black boy wakes up and says, 'What can I do today?'\" Robinson said.\nHe hopes that as mayor he can clear a path forward in a city with a long history of racial violence, dating back to the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, which destroyed the Black Greenwood District and killed some 300 Black residents.\n\"When you look and think that we are just on the sunset of the 100-year anniversary of the Tulsa race massacre, and not one descendant of a victim has yet to receive justice,\" Robinson said. \"There are still families that are being victimized by police violence, and no justice is found.\"\n'Rally cry' for alt-right?\nAnissia West is an educator and activist who has also lived in Tulsa her whole life. A descendent of Creek Freedmen, former African slaves of Muscogee Creek tribal members, West says it's crucial for Tulsa to reckon with its past as it looks to the future, starting with President Trump's rally this weekend.\nShe says he should have moved the rally to a different weekend.\n\"Juneteenth is a whole weekend celebration. It might start on Thursday and last through Sunday,\" she said.\nShe says Trump's decision to rally in Tulsa, not far away from the site of such a deadly racial massacre, is more than coincidence.\n\"I can't help but look at it as anything other than an act of terrorism,\" she said. \"He knows that whether he believes he is racist or not, he knows that members of the KKK and other alt-right organizations are following him and that they will see what he is doing as a rally cry.\"\nThe area where many successful Black Tulsa residents lived in the early 20th century was burned to the ground in 1921\nAlthough West is dismayed by the President's visit, she says she has never been prouder of her city and its response to the police killing of George Floyd.\n\"I've spent years protesting in Tulsa and other places in Oklahoma with really low turnouts,\" West said. \"I was mad at Tulsa because we have a tendency to do the thing we call 'Tulsa nice,' where we're fighting for something, but we're gonna also have a barbecue. This time was different.\"\nWest strolls to a popular spot in the Greenwood District, where a large mural commemorates the neighborhood that was once known as Black Wall Street, at one time the beacon of hope for Black life.\n\"This is sacred space,\" she said. \"We know this is a space where buildings were destroyed.

Kaepernick accused NFL team owners of colluding to keep him from being signed. The NFL denied any collusion but in 2019, they reached a settlement with Kaepernick and former teammate Eric Reid, who knelt with him.\nProtests against Floyd's killing have continued throughout US cities, with many sports stars taking part.\nThomas criticized Saints quarterback Drew Brees this week for saying he would \"never agree with anybody disrespecting the flag,\" a reference to the national anthem protest movement started by Kaepernick.\nBrees later apologized for 'insensitive' comments.\nAuthorities have arrested Derek Chauvin, the former police officer who pinned Floyd to the ground by his neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds before he died.

Others point to institutional disadvantages burdening Black and Latino communities which have been linked to increases in violence.\nAnd as those communities grieve recent victims of shootings, they're also facing the ongoing spread of coronavirus, which experts have said has disproportionately affected Latino communities as well as Black communities, who often have unequal access to healthcare and pre-existing conditions.\nThe day's biggest stories in 10 minutes or less.\nSign up and get access to videos and weekly student quizzes.\nSign Me Up\nNo, Thanks\nBy subscribing you agree to our\nprivacy policy.\n\"For me, personally, it's hard to see the number of Black victims from gun violence and dealing with Covid infections that are coming to the hospital because that just indicates that there are root causes to these inequities that are being unmasked by the virus, that are being exacerbated by the gun violence,\" Williams says.\nDoctor on dealing with both pandemic and rise in gun violence 04:29\nA holistic approach to ending the violence\nThe spikes in violence have had a \"chilling\" effect on communities of color, says Arc of Justice President and Founder Kirsten John Foy.\n\"I have done several vigils where the narrative and the message coming out of these violent and horrific acts is 'Black lives matter,'\" he said. \"And we're not directing that at an external force like the NYPD or other law enforcement.

His grandson was killed in crossfire this month\n\"This is having a disparate effect on certain communities and we are not getting the same reaction from the press or the politicians about that disparate effect that we are about other things,\" he said.\nTackling the crime, in Foy's perspective, doesn't mean just bettering the justice system. It means focusing on other community initiatives as well -- like youth programs.\n\"Many of our young people are suffering from trauma, trauma that's inflicted by violence. Trauma that originates out of poverty, the conditions that they live under. The absence of adequate housing, the absence of opportunities,\" Foy said.\n\"When it's easier for a young person who is feeling a sense of despair, hopelessness, when it is easier for them to get their hands on a gun than it is for them to get their hands on an application for a job,\" he said, \"then that is a recipe for disaster.\"\nReforming police while effectively fighting crime\nSome New York officials say the surge in violence comes after sweeping reforms that were passed by the City Council last month to hold police accountable amid growing calls from protesters and communities of criminal justice reform. The department's Anti-Crime unit, officers who were more often on the streets, was also disbanded.\nWith similar legislation aimed at curbing police brutality passed in cities throughout the country and more officials voicing support for calls to defund -- and in some cases, abolish -- police departments, police chiefs in parts of the US have reported declining morale, with officers calling out sick or resigning.\nCrime is surging in US cities. Some say defunding the police will actually make it fall\n\"There is a feeling on the street that the police are handcuffed, that they are not out there as aggressively as we were in the past,\" NYPD Chief Terence Monahan said this week, speaking to New York radio station 1010 WINS. \"(Police) are fearful if they take some proactive-type enforcement.\n\"The disbanding of Anti-Crime obviously had a huge effect. Those are our best cops out on the street, grabbing guns,\" he said. \"So there's a feeling that it's safe to carry a gun on the street.\"\nThe key, Miller told CNN Tuesday night, is working with communities to address disparities and reform police -- but still be able to fight crime effectively.\n\"This is the deal with police,\" he said. \"Society has a series of safety nets. There's health, youth services, mental health services, but throughout history whenever those safety nets have become work or broken or had holes in them, when people start to fall through them, at the bottom there's always a cop.\"\n\"Those safety nets need to have those holes fixed,\" Miller said. \"The problem we're facing right now is we have a crime surge, which requires more cops and we're about to have less, and requires better deployments and more deployments.\""}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/29/us/black-parents-children-safety-talk-blake/index.html", "headline": "George Floyd.

Johnson", "published_date": "2020-06-27", "text": "(CNN)More than 43,000 people say they want a statue of Christopher Columbus in Elizabeth, New Jersey, removed. But that's not all -- they want it replaced with one of Marsha P. Johnson, a tribute they say has been a long time coming.\n\"I've always said that Marsha was more recognized in New York City and around the world than she is in her own hometown,\" her nephew, Al Michaels, says.\nJohnson, a pioneering trans-rights activist and one of the central figures in New York City's gay liberation movement from the 1960s through the 1980s, was born and raised in Elizabeth and left in her late teens with nothing but a few dollars to her name.\nShe leaves behind both a legacy of kindness and perseverance. Despite the slew of challenges she had to overcome as a Black, transgender person, those who knew her say Johnson was defined by the confidence in who she was, the compassion and care she showed others and her vibrant personality -- often translating into colorful headpieces and dashing outfits.\nLast year, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the city would commemorate both the work of Johnson and her friend and activist Sylvia Rivera with statues in Greenwich Village. Their monument will be among the first in the world to honor transgender people, the mayor's office had said.\nMichaels says it was a pleasant surprise when he saw a petition calling for the change in statues in Elizabeth. He's one of the thousands of people who have signed in about a week. He says he's even more thrilled the movement has started with such a young crowd.\nMarsha P. Johnson handing out flyers in support of gay students at New York University in 1970.\nA petition gaining traction\nThat petition was created by 19-year-old Celine Da Silva, who also grew up in Elizabeth and says she's been familiar with Johnson for years. The activist long remained part of the conversations among the city's LGBTQ community, Da Silva says, but she only recently found out Johnson was from Elizabeth.\nInspired by the reignited Black Lives Matter movement across the country in recent weeks and the tearing down of more monuments reminiscent of brutal parts of US history, Da Silva says she felt it was time the city began trekking in the same direction.\nMarsha P. Johnson\n\"There was an overwhelming amount of positive support,\" she says. \"It tells me that times are changing. People are becoming more accepting to people who identify as LGBT. It tells me that people are realizing how whitewashed our history is and how some figures that we learn about, we don't learn everything about them.\"\nEarlier this month, two other New Jersey communities moved to take down memorials to Christopher Columbus. The mayor of Camden announced the removal of a Christopher Columbus statue saying in a statement its \"presence has long pained the residents of the community.\" And in West Orange, the mayor said a Columbus monument would also be coming down, adding celebrations of Columbus' life are \"divisive and a symbol of hate and oppression and cannot remain as part of our community.\"\nBoth communities say they are working to determine what they can erect as replacements.\nDa Silva says she wants her community and other communities across the US to be celebrating more minorities and more \"people who are different from us.\"\nMarsha P. Johnson, a black transgender woman, was a central figure in the gay liberation movement\n\"And I think that the LGBT and queer community should be able to learn more about historic figures from their own community,\" she says.\nThe four young people CNN spoke with working to create change in their hometown of Elizabeth all expressed disappointment in not learning as much about figures like Johnson.\nCarter Muelle, who also helped create the petition, says schools perhaps don't know how to approach those issues. Muelle told CNN they conducted their own research after learning about Johnson.\nThey describe Johnson as a \"legend\" for the LGBTQ community.\n\"Black trans women are the most ignored and the most disrespected people, in my opinion, out of anyone,\" Muelle said. \"So I feel just her being a statue here will give hope to a lot of younger people, for sure, a lot of LGBT youth.\"\nMarsha P. Johnson surrounded by what her friend Randy Wicker says she called 'her children'\n50 strangers at the door\nIt's hardly difficult to see why the crowd behind this movement is so passionate about honoring Johnson.\nThose who knew Johnson say to know her was to love her. And for those who didn't like her, well she had her middle initial to use as her response: P -- for 'Pay it no mind.'\nMichaels says he has memories of Johnson from his childhood, when the activist would often return to her family home in Elizabeth for the holidays. She had almost always given all the clothes her parents and siblings provided her to people she would say needed them more. And she'd almost always show up to the door accompanied by a crowd.\n\"She would bring them home and there'd be 50 strangers at my grandmother's door with Marsha,\" he says. \"Sometimes they'd be there for the whole week.\n\"I'm telling you, I never knew these people and you would think they were really, really family because they stayed like family.\"\nOne of those friends: Randy Wicker, whose Hoboken, New Jersey, apartment was often Johnson's home as well.\nMarsha P. Johnson with friend Randy Wicker\nWicker, now 82, was initially hesitant of Johnson, who often worked as a prostitute and would sometimes end up in jail as a result. The two had very different approaches as well: both activists for LGBTQ rights, he would often sport a suit while Johnson opted for colorful dresses and, more often than not, bright red lipstick.\nBy the end of her lifetime the two had become like family, he says. Johnson's body was found in the Hudson River in 1992 and the circumstances of her death are still unclear. New York police ruled the death a suicide and didn't investigate. Her case was later reopened and remains undetermined.\nThe challenges she faced -- taking to the streets for an income, battling mental illness and sometimes homelessness -- meant she never criticized people who were down and instead worked to help them overcome their own battles, Wicker says.\n\"She found importance in helping others,\" he says. \"She realized that -- well, we say it but we don't really practice it -- and that is: so many things are more important than money.\"\nAnd the community caught on, today often referring to her as a saint-like figure. After she passed, Wicker says he remembers reading a tribute for Johnson, which was accompanied by her photo. Over her head was a halo.\nNot a question, but a demand\nDa Silva, who created the petition, and her boyfriend, Daniel Cano, plan on bringing up their request to the city council.\nThe effort is just one of several steps the city's young residents have taken to create a more inclusive Elizabeth.\nIn recent weeks, a new organization has begun forming -- the People's Committee of Elizabeth -- which is meant to elevate the city's Black community, the group's co-founder, 22-year-old Priscilla Gaona.\nOnline petitions work best when you do more than just sign\n\"We basically say we have to amplify the voices of the most affected and vulnerable in our city which is the Black community,\" Gaona, who backs the petition, said. \"Any figure that is rooted in colonialism or white supremacy, that degrades what our goal is.\"\nOn Saturday, the group also plans to host a Pride march, Gaona says.\nCano, who helped with the petition's creation and has been pushing for support on social media, says he hopes this move is only the first step in transforming their community.\n\"Obviously we're not asking the city council to consider putting up a statue,\" he says. \"This is a demand.\"\n\"Ultimately, a statue is going to come up no matter what. And we're going to honor Marsha in the way that she deserves to be honored.\""}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/26/us/all-lives-matter-reenactment-njdoc/index.html", "headline": "NJ corrections officer may lose his job over George Floyd death re-enactment", "published_date": "2020-06-27", "text": "(CNN)A New Jersey corrections officer who was suspended for his alleged role in mocking the death of George Floyd and re-enacting it earlier this month faces termination from his job and internal charges from his union.\nAll Lives Matter demonstrators carried out the re-enactment at a Black Lives Matter march in Franklinville, New Jersey, on June 8.

The blue line is meant to symbolize law enforcement. The space above the blue line represents societal order, and the space below the line is meant to be crime and chaos. The \"thin blue line\" of law enforcement separates the two, according to Thin Blue Line USA, which makes pro-police clothing and gifts that support police nonprofits.\n\"A lot going on in the world right now and I wanted to express that most first responders are good people,\" Weatherman tweeted ahead of the race. \"My uncle is a firefighter and he would do anything to help save lives.\"\nMike Harmon, who runs Mike Harmon Racing, Weatherman's team, said since the paint scheme went public, the team has received hundreds of emails from the families of officers killed in the line of duty who appreciate the recognition.\n\"As far as this week's paint theme, there's thousands upon thousands of police officers in this country that serve us very well and they do not deserve to be disrespected and not be appreciated,\" Harmon said in a statement to CNN. \"We at MHR want to send the message (that the deaths of police officers killed in the line of duty) wasn't in vain and that they're not forgotten and very much appreciated.\"\nThe team has previously painted cars to honor active military and veterans, law enforcement officers and first responders.

NASCAR said flying the flag at races \"runs contrary to our commitment to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all fans, our competitors and our industry.\"\nThat decision wasn't welcomed by all. At least one driver quit the sport over the decision, and some Southern fans decried it as a violation of their heritage.

Created by Leah Asmelash and Brandon Tensley, this newsletter hopes to offer a window into how history can, and should, inform people's lives.\nBut this isn't a dry history textbook. Our aim is to help readers engage in the challenging conversations on race by introducing them to more contemporary pieces of culture that will entertain and illuminate as much as they educate and inform.\nFor this week, we highlight Hulu removing a supposed blackface episode, revisit Martin Luther King Jr.'s final essay and take a look at the BET Awards, which were exactly what we needed.\nThis week in culture\nLeah: Did you hear about Hulu pulling that episode of \"The Golden Girls,\" with \"blackface\"? Any thoughts?\nBrandon: Yes! I did hear about that -- and I think that it's BANANAS.\nL: OK, explain! So many TV shows have been doing this. What makes GG different?\nB: For one, in that particular GG episode, the characters -- Rose and Blanche -- aren't actually in blackface. They're wearing mud masks and freak out because they think that somebody might mistake the masks for blackface. The episode is about white anxiety when it comes to race.\nHulu's decision seems like a reflexive one instead of a rigorous one that might prod audiences to think more deeply about race, or about the enduring impact and influence of cultural artifacts.\nL: Right! It just feels like Hulu missed the point? They're pulling the episode because they think that it'll get backlash, without doing any real grappling with the issue. Kind of like ... the NBA saying that it will paint Black Lives Matter on its courts?\nB: Lordt. Yeah, I sort of rolled my eyes when I read that announcement. It's not that visible signs of solidarity aren't important. It's that, too often, that's where support for a marginalized community ends -- with a cute gesture. I'm curious to see if the NBA, which historically has been a very activist-minded organization, supports the Black Lives Matter movement in other, more substantial ways. But what are your thoughts?\nL: I agree. So much of this moment feels super performative to me. Some NBA players have asked not to resume the season in light of the protests, and yet the commissioner is forging ahead -- ignoring these complaints (presumably because of money). There's also a lot of dark irony in the fact that the majority-Black NBA will be exposing its players to the coronavirus on courts that literally say that their lives matter. It's like the NBA is activist-y when it suits it. Kind of like how that Houston realtor group said that it'd stop using the phrase \"master\" in reference to bedrooms and bathrooms, when that's not really the main problem people are worried about.\nB: Are there any other recent examples that jump out at you as cringey?\nL: WHERE TO BEGIN. I'm a sports fan, so I keep going back to the Washington NFL team, which is quite literally named after a Native slur. On Black Out Tuesday, they released their little statement saying that Black Lives Matter, but if they truly believed that Black lives matter, they should believe that Native lives matter, too. Which makes me think: How can you say BLM when your name is a slur? One doesn't match the other.\nB: My pessimistic takeaway from all this is that these sorts of moves are more about protecting brands than about supporting lives. Show is nice. Substance is better. As so many people have been saying, this moment feels different. Hopefully the responses from organizations will be different, too.\n'A Testament of Hope'\nIf you think that the ongoing protests are just about police killing Black men and women, you're missing the point. They're about so much more: about ending mass incarceration, about investing in housing programs. You can't separate one from the other.\nA good place to start to understand how everything is interconnected is with this essay from Martin Luther King Jr., \"A Testament of Hope,\" which made the same point in 1968. Because, alas, we've been fighting the same fight for more than half a century.\n\"The black revolution is much more than a struggle for the rights of Negroes,\" King wrote. \"It is forcing America to face all its interrelated flaws -- racism, poverty, militarism and materialism. It is exposing evils that are rooted deeply in the whole structure of our society.\"\nIn addition to revealing the radical dimensions of a civil rights icon who's often flattened to his non-violence mantra, the essay helps us to understand why the current Black Lives Matter protests, fueled by years of organizing, feel so impactful.\nFollowing the police killing of George Floyd in May, demonstrators haven't just been condemning the latest manifestation of American racism; they've been aiming at, to use King's own words, the very roots of social control. They're aware that advocating for Black Americans can't be teased apart from, say, ending police militarization, or from investing in economic justice broadly. King reminds us that it's here, in this expansive vision of liberation, where hope lies -- where the most momentous change starts.\nRecommended for your eyes and ears\nFor the last week, we've had Beyonc\u00e9's \"Black Parade\" on repeat.

(But) we are still in a position of privilege that it's a choice to have these discussions, whereas black families need to have these conversations because of safety and real lived experiences.\"\nThe letters have been shared widely on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.

But it's a great time to be an American", "published_date": "2020-07-04", "text": "(CNN)On July 9, 1776, a rowdy group of American colonists banded together at a political rally in New York City and did something that today would be called \"badass.\"\nThey had just been treated to a public reading of the Declaration of Independence, which Congress had officially adopted less than a week earlier. After hearing calls to \"dissolve the political bands\" of tyranny, they marched to a public park that featured a statue of King George III, Britain's ruler, and knocked the 4,000-pound statue off its 15-foot pedestal.\nThe head of the statue was then decapitated and perched on top of a spike, and much of the rest was melted down to make 42,000 musket balls for American soldiers.\nThe historian Erika Doss thought of that scene recently while watching protesters toppling statues of Confederate heroes. Doss, who recounts the 1776 episode in her book, \"Memorial Mania,\" sees a parallel between the colonists who fought against Great Britain and protesters who rail against Confederate monuments today.\nA man holds a Black Lives Matter sign during a protest against racial inequality on June 23, 2020, in Boston.\n\"They're patriots,\" says Doss, an American studies professor at the University of Notre Dame, of today's protesters. \"They're looking at the symbols and these visual and martial emblems and icons in their midst and they're saying this doesn't stand for who we are today.\"\nIt's easy to be cynical this Fourth of July weekend as the US celebrates its birth. The country seems like a mess. Racial protests have rocked every major city. Unemployment has soared. And Americans can't even agree if they should wear face masks in the middle of a pandemic.\nBut what some see as chaos, others see as an explosion of patriotism. They see it in the armies of Americans that took to the streets to protest racism. They see it in the companies that are taking unprecedented stands against racial and social injustice.\nEven the Americans who are wearing masks for the health of their neighbors -- they, too, are reasons to wave the flag.\nA group of Bostonians dressed as Native Americans dump crates of imported British tea into Boston Harbor as a protest against the British Tea Act in 1773.\nAll of these different groups have declared their independence from symbols and ideas that they've decided no longer represent them, Doss and others say.\nThey are doing what their ancestors did in 1776, Doss says: \"They are reimagining themselves and the nation.\"\nAmerica is bending toward justice\nThe evidence of this reimagining is reflected in the headlines.\nSomething has shifted in America when the Mississippi state flag, which bears the cross of the Confederate battle flag, is taken down while the popularity of the Black Lives Matter movement soars to an all-time high. Recent polls suggest that this year's BLM protests, which drew as many as 26 million people, were the largest movement in US history.\nRead more from John Blake:\nAm I racist?

She wants a different legacy for her son\nTrump is doing what Obama couldn't\nBlack Lives Matter has been described as everything from a hashtag to a \"symbol of hate.\" But the movement has rarely been described as something else: one of the finest examples of patriotism in modern America.\nThe protesters who flooded the streets this spring to protest racism exemplify the revolutionary spirit of America just as much as the white colonists in powdered wigs, says Melanye Price, a professor at Prairie View A&M University in Texas who specializes in African-American politics.\nA protester carries a US flag upside down, a sign of distress, next to a burning building on May 28, 2020, in Minneapolis.\n\"The people who are out yelling in the streets today are no different than Paul Revere yelling 'The British are coming!''' says Price. \"It's the American way to voice criticism of the government and to rebel against oppressive forces.\"\nIn some ways, the protesters who took to the streets this year did a better job of honoring the words of the Declaration of Independence than the Founding Fathers, she says.\nMany of our nation's founders were slave owners who treated Black Americans as tools for economic profit. When they said, \"all men are created equal,\" that didn't include Black people, who were not considered fully human. They didn't consider women equal, either.\nBut Black people extracted concepts from the Declaration of Independence, like the right to protest, and \"turned them into tools for American citizenship,\" Price says. \"They took the words of the founders and rammed them up their damn throats.\"\nWe've expanded the definition of an American hero\nIt's easy to forget, but the person who became the catalyst the American Revolution was not a White man. He was half Black and half Native American. His name was Crispus Attucks, and he was killed during the 1770 Boston Massacre, an event that sparked the Revolutionary War.\nThe person who sparked the unprecedented wave of racial protests this year was also a Black man. George Floyd, who died while being arrested in May by Minneapolis police, is in some ways a modern-day Attucks, says Jerald Podair, a historian at Lawrence University in Wisconsin.\n\"Attucks died not knowing what his impact and significance would be, as did George Floyd,\" says Podair.\nHistory textbooks tell us that American heroes are almost always White men carrying guns. A reader has to dig to learn about people like Sacagawea, the Native American woman whose language skills and bravery saved the vaunted Lewis & Clark expedition of the early 19th century.\nAn image based on an iconic painting, \"Spirit of '76,\" that depicts American patriots of the colonial era.\nThis year's protests, though, have enlarged the definition of a what an American hero looks like. Some of the leaders and participants in Black Lives Matter protests are LGBTQ. The movement is multiracial and multiethnic.\nAnd in some ways these protesters are just as tough as their colonial forebears.\nThe history books love to tell stories of the Minutemen, the elite band of Revolutionary War soldiers who were ready at a minute's notice to rush into battle. The Black Lives Matter protesters and others who recently took to the streets to demonstrate were not that different. They risked their lives, often on short notice via a text or social media alert, to demonstrate against racism in the middle of a pandemic.\nAge made no difference. Many of those demonstrators were young -- some even too young to vote. They took rubber bullets to the face and swallowed tear gas. And then they came back the next day, like soldiers.\nIf you think that characterization is hyperbolic, listen to the words of another American hero who praised millennials -- people born between 1981 and 1996 -- in a recent speech. He said the country's youth make him optimistic about the future.\n\"They're not a lot like my generation -- in many ways, they are better,\" he said. \"They care so much about their friends, they care about the issues, they question things in a way that I'm not sure we baby boomers questioned.

William McRaven, the Navy SEAL who oversaw the Osama bin Laden raid.\nA man waves an American flag with the words \"Not Free\" on it at a Juneteenth rally in Washington on June 19, 2020.\nThe coronavirus pandemic has also enlarged the definition of an American hero. We've learned that courage isn't just manifested in a SEAL team raid. It also can be summoned in mundane places like a health clinic, a grocery store or a meatpacking plant.\nThe pandemic has led many Americans to realize how dependent they are on these service workers, who risk their lives to keep the country running.\nThe colonists often invoked the term \"liberty\" to celebrate a form of rugged individualism where government and rules left them alone so they could live their version of freedom. So do many modern-day Americans. But democracy also depends on a sense of shared community, says Podair, the Lawrence University historian.\n\"Our life and health depends on the behavior of other people,\" he says. \"We depend on our neighbor, sometimes to get us food or just to remain healthy -- and they on us. Because of the pandemic, America is a more democratic nation today than it was in February.\"\nOur country is finally facing one of its original sins\nThe Black Lives Matter protesters may exceed the Founding Fathers in another way -- they're forcing the nation to face its racism.\nWhen Thomas Jefferson drafted the Declaration of Independence, he added language that described the slave trade as a perverse plot by an evil English king to contaminate the colonies, Joseph J. Ellis recounts in \"Founding Brothers,\" his Pulitzer Prize-winning book.\nThat passage, though was deleted by the Continental Congress in the final draft. The issue was so contentious and ingrained in colonial society that many founders thought abolishing slavery would kill the young nation in its infancy, Ellis wrote.\nBut a new generation of Americans are determined to do what the Founding Fathers refused to do.\nThe Rev. William Barber, president of Repairers of the Breach, speaks in Washington on June 12, 2019.\nAmericans are devouring books on racism and corporate America is taking a stand against racial injustice. Ordinary people are talking about racism with a new depth that's remarkable, says Doss, the historian.\n\"It has been so interesting to see how words like white supremacy and imperialism are part of daily American vocabulary in ways now that were not a couple of years ago,\" she says.\nThis change didn't just happen. It took years of planning and activism.\n\"A multiracial fusion coalition has shifted public opinion in this country, and we've seen a tipping point in the past month,\" says the Rev. William Barber II, a 2018 MacArthur Foundation \"genius\" grant winner and president of Repairers of the Breach, a nonpartisan group that seeks to build a moral agenda around issues of poverty and racism.\n\"Many of us have been building this coalition for years, taking up the work of those who came before us,\" he says. \"We never knew when the tipping point would come, but we are now in a moment where there is a public consensus that America must address the legacy of her original sin in systemic racism.\"\nAt the same time, there appears to be flagging interest in white grievance. It's not just Confederate monuments that are coming down. A core political tactic that relied on coded racist appeals may also be starting to topple.\nA statue of Confederate Commander Richard W. Dowling is removed in Houston, Texas, on June 17, 2020.\nIn the 1960s the Republican Party quietly began its \"Southern Strategy\" of using terms like \"forced busing\" and \"state's rights\" to play on racial fears and win elections. Democrats have also used such appeals, but not to the extent Republicans have.\nBut racial dog whistles just don't hunt like they used to. President Trump is offering proof. He's opposing any effort by the US military to rename bases that bear the name of Confederate commanders. He also called Black Lives Matter a \"symbol of hate.\"\nAnd as of now he's losing badly to Democratic challenger Joe Biden in the polls.\n\"When we look back, we may well realize that there was indeed one last presidential election that could be won on white racial resentment \u2014 but that election happened in 2016,\" Paul Waldman said in a recent Washington Post column.\nWillie Townsend, an employee of the Mississippi State Capitol, on June 30, 2020, hours before Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves signed a bill into law replacing the current state flag.\nProtesters in 2020, though, want more than an end to racist speech. Barber, for example, has helped launch a Poor People's Campaign and his group plans an array of activities around the Fourth of July this weekend.\n\"We can't get sidelined into little reforms around the edges,\" Barber says. \"This isn't just about bringing down a flag or banning chokeholds. We are in a moment that demands a Third Reconstruction to guarantee freedom and equal justice. We must push to become the America that has never yet been.\"\nThat kind of America may seem far off right now. But we no longer have to look to the Founding Fathers to celebrate the spirit that makes this nation special.\nWe can look to the faces of the millions of Americans who took to the streets this year to reimagine the nation. We can look to the nurse who takes our temperature, or the other essential and brave workers who drive buses, deliver groceries and restock store shelves.\nThat's the paradox of this Fourth of July. It is an awful time to be an American. It is a great time to look forward to a New America.\nAll the people who took to the streets this spring are living monuments to a New America -- a land that never was, \"and yet must be.\""}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/06/us/wnba-uniforms-say-her-name-spt-trnd/index.html", "headline": "WNBA players will wear uniforms that honor the women and girls lost to police brutality and racial violence", "published_date": "2020-07-06", "text": "(CNN)This season's WNBA players hope that before you chant their names, you'll remember the victims of police and racial violence too.\nWhen the league's 2020 season tips off later this month, WNBA players will be wearing special uniforms designed to honor and demand justice for women who they say \"have been the forgotten victims of police brutality and racial violence,\" according to a press release on Monday.\nWNBA star Maya Moore speaks of her 'relief' after helping a man overturn his prison sentence\nThe league's players will wear warm-up shirts with the words \"Black Lives Matter\" displayed on the front and \"Say Her Name\" on the back, alongside Breonna Taylor's name.\nGame courts at IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida, will also feature a Black Lives Matter logo.\nTaylor, a 26-year-old Black EMT, was killed when police broke down the door to her apartment in an attempted drug sting and shot her eight times.

Some of his fellow seminary students called him a country hick behind his back.\nHe was so earnest that when a seminary professor returned his heavily corrected paper, he didn't get angry. He instead sent the professor a note of thanks, saying no one had ever tried to help him like this before.\n\"Every word from him,\" the professor later said about the young man named John Robert Lewis, \"had its own special truth. They might as well be carved in granite if John spoke them.\"\nThe US loses two icons of the civil rights movement in one day\nThat \"special truth\" is what many tributes to US Rep. John Lewis missed when they marked his death last weekend.\nHis death came on the same day as another civil rights giant, the Rev. C.T. Vivian, and four months after that of Joseph E. Lowery.\nTaken together, they seem to mark an end. Lewis was depicted as one of the last living links to the classic civil rights era of epic marches and rousing speeches.\nAnd with his demise, the obvious questions arose: Who are the Black leaders to champion the civil rights battles of today?\nThe answer: no one. And that's a good thing.\nThe truth is Lewis was no civil rights \"hero,\" and that's precisely what made him special.\nIn many ways, Lewis had more in common with the Black Lives Matter protestors who filled the nation's streets earlier this year than the iconic civil rights leaders he's so often compared to.\nThe era of great speeches is over\nHow John Lewis befriended a young boy and changed his life forever\nConsider the story about Lewis' \"special truth.\"\nThose words come from the pen of Pulitzer-Prize winning author, David Halberstam, who wrote about Lewis' formative years in a classic civil rights book called \"The Children.\"\nIt details Lewis' journey from poverty in rural Alabama to his enrollment at the American Baptist College in Nashville. The city became a launching pad for the student sit-in movement in the early 1960s.\nSome of Lewis' fellow students underestimated him because he wasn't a great speaker.\nThe classic civil rights era was defined by them, and it wasn't just the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. People like Malcolm X, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Stokely Carmichael could also bring an audience to its feet.\nYet a movement doesn't need a great speaker to be successful today. Black Lives Matter is proof of that. So was Lewis.\n50 years after the March on Washington: What's changed for African-Americans\nLewis was in seemingly every big civil rights battle: the sit-ins, the Freedom Rides, and the March on Washington. Can anyone, though, cite a great speech from him?\nHe is known more for what he didn't say in his most famous speech, the one he gave at the 1963 March on Washington. March organizers asked him to cut portions they deemed too inflammatory.\nDiane Nash, another civil rights icon who was a leader in the Nashville sit-in movement, said Lewis was like that from the beginning. He wouldn't say much when student sit-in leaders convened fiery meetings to discuss decisions that could cost them their lives.\n\"His verbal contribution would often be a sentence like, 'I think we need a sit-in tomorrow,' '' she says. \"That's about all he would say.\"\nYet Lewis was considered one of the greatest student sit-in leaders by the sheer power of his example. He kept showing up at the front of protests no matter how many times he was assaulted.\nThe power of that kind of persistence sometimes gets lost when people talk about that era. People overestimate the power of a great speech. They think the movement was powered by Aaron Sorkin-like moments: Impossibly eloquent leaders unfurling brilliant speeches skewering their opponents.\nBut King's \"I Have a Dream Speech\" wouldn't have mattered much if the movement didn't keep up the pressure of demonstrations through campaigns in Mississippi the next year and Alabama the following year. It wouldn't have mattered much if President Lyndon Johnson didn't use all of his legislative cunning to steer the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act.\nPersistence matters more than eloquence\nRemembering John Lewis\nPersistence is more important than eloquence. Lewis proved that. Black Lives Matter and the other protestors are proving that today.\nCan anyone, for example, cite any great speech from any of those protestors this year? But the absence of such a moment didn't slow it down.\nOne of the most defining moments in this year's protests didn't even come through words but came through a piece of street theater. An unidentified woman dubbed the \"Naked Athena\" seized the spotlight this past weekend when she appeared \"like an apparition\" before armed police troops and dared them to hurt her.\nShe never said a word but her surreal appearance and calm amid danger may be one of those signature protest moments.\nTechnology fuels movements now\nJohn Lewis Fast Facts\nThere's another reason that protest movements don't need great speeches to fuel them: technology. Today's protestors don't just want to listen; they want to express themselves as well.\nWe live in an era when people are accustomed to having their own platform, Timothy Patrick McCarthy, an activist and historian at the Harvard Kennedy School Harvard University, told me when I interviewed him for a story about BLM.\n\"Everybody tweets, Snapchats and posts on Facebook,\" he said. \"Everybody has a platform.\"\nA movement is no longer dependent on a charismatic leader\nBlack Lives Matter mural outside Trump Tower vandalized three times in one week\nThe tributes to Lewis also missed something else about the man. They called him a \"civil rights leader.\"\nThat's actually the wrong word to use for Lewis, say some who worked for him.\n\"John didn't see himself as a spokesperson or a leader but as an organizer,\" says Larry Rubin, who worked alongside Lewis in a group called SNCC, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.\n\"To be an effective organizer, you had to set your ego aside because you were building up others.\"\nWhether they know it or not, BLM subscribes to the same leadership model that Lewis followed. It's a \"a\" organization; so are many of the other protests against police brutality that spread across the country.\n\"We've always made it clear that we are one of many,\" Johnetta Elzie, a leader in the BLM movement and Campaign Zero, another organization formed to fight police brutality, once told me. \"There's not one person who can be a leader of the movement. We're all leaders.\"\n'The cross is a little lighter today'\n\nMany critics thought BLM was making a mistake. They thought an organization needed strong central leadership to articulate goals, beat back criticism and provide direction. (I was one of them.)\nElzie was right -- this year's protests prove her point. But Lewis and SNCC members proved that point years ago.\nSNCC didn't provide charismatic leaders. They encouraged people in the community to step out in front, like Fannie Lou Hamer, the Mississippi sharecropper who turned out to be one of the most mesmerizing leaders in the movement.\nThere's a pragmatism in this approach as well. Movements built around charismatic leaders evaporate when that leader is assassinated or discredited. The civil rights movement never recovered from the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968. Few today can name the organization that Malcolm X headed when he was assassinated by Nation of Islam members (It was called the Organization of Afro-American Unity).\nA singular leader may not survive today's media scrutiny\nPolls show widespread support of Black Lives Matters protests and varied views on how to reform police\nThere's another reason why building a movement around a singular leader might not work today: They may not survive today's media environment.\nHow, for example, would conservative media treat King's alleged marital infidelity? How would social media handle Malcolm's criminal past as \"Detroit Red.\" Public figures don't have private lives anymore. There are so many ways that a leader can be discredited.\nLewis, to his credit, never went through that social media crucible. He preserved almost universal respect until the very end. He also lived long enough to see the election of the nation's first Black president as well as the Floyd protests spreading across the world this year.\nHe talked about the protests often before he passed.\n\"This feels and looks so different,\" he said in an interview with CBS not long before he died. \"It is so much more massive and all inclusive.\"\nStill, the people who flooded the streets this year aren't that much different than the young Lewis who people made fun of in seminary.\nThey spoke with actions, not words. They kept coming back the next day, no matter how much they were hurt. And they defied all the expectations for what a civil rights leader was supposed to talk and act like.\nIt's true that Lewis belongs to the era of Freedom Rides and epic marches, but he also showed you don't need to be a traditional civil rights hero to get things done.\nWe do him a disservice if we freeze him in the black and white footage of the 1960s.\nHe doesn't just belong on the Edmund Pettus Bridge. He's in the streets of places like Portland, where protestors keep marching through tear gas and rubber bullets.\nHe lives today as much as he has in the past."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/18/us/burning-cross-activist-virginia-trnd/index.html", "headline": "Possible burned cross found on front yard of 17-year-old activist's house after he organized protests", "published_date": "2020-06-18", "text": "(CNN)A Virginia police department and the FBI are investigating a possible cross burning at the home of a 17-year-old activist the morning after he helped organize a Black Lives Matter protest.\nTravon Brown of Marion, Virginia, helped New Panthers -- a BLM movement group -- organize an anti-racism protest on Saturday.\nThe following morning, Brown was away from home when his mother texted him asking if he was okay.

Economy\nNew coronavirus fears are putting a swift end to Wall Street's recent rally. US stocks plummeted yesterday, recording their worst day since March 16. Those fears spread to Asian markets, which fell early today. This could signal that investors are concerned about a second pandemic wave, especially since the US recently hit 2 million Covid-19 cases. American joblessness also continues to climb, with 1.5 million more Americans filing for first-time unemployment last week. However, no matter how bad the pandemic gets again, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the US economy will not be shut down again.\nStocks plunge as new coronavirus cases rise 01:22\n4. Coronavirus\nThere's some good news on the coronavirus front, though. Experts say an existing polio vaccine could help protect against the disease. There is plenty of evidence that existing inoculations like polio vaccines protect children against a wide range of infections, and researchers recently wrote in Science magazine that it's worth trying them out against the coronavirus. An oral polio vaccine is safe, cheap, easy to give and widely available, with over 1 billion doses produced and used annually in more than 140 countries. Meanwhile, the first trial of a Covid-19 antibody cocktail in the United States is underway. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. says if its drug combination is successful, it could treat and prevent Covid-19 -- and hopefully be available by the fall.\nHow antibodies protect us from viruses 01:37\n5. Lebanon\nAnti-government protesters have flooded the streets of Lebanese cities as the country's currency tanked, adding to a string of economic woes. Lebanon's currency has lost around 70% of its value since October, with a big dip in the last few days. The currency's collapse has stirred panic in a nation that relies heavily on imports for its basic needs. On top of it all, Lebanon has endured soaring food prices, mass layoffs and business closures in recent months. The government, led by Prime Minister Hassan Diab, has been in power for just over 100 days, and protesters say it hasn't done enough to address the economic problems or curb government corruption.\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\nCollege coaches and teams want to encourage voting by giving athletes Election Day off\nThe coach behind the movement says voting is a habit that should be started at a young age.\nKelly Clarkson and her husband Brandon Blackstock are splitting\nThe couple have been married for seven years.\nThese are some of the world's most expensive divorces 01:52\nA 50,000-year-old lake in India just turned pink, and no one knows why\nSeems extremely normal during these troubling times, nothing to see here.\nSony finally revealed its PS5, and here's everything you need to know\nStaying inside suddenly got a little easier.\nSony unveils the PlayStation 5 01:57\nTamagotchi, the virtual pet from the '90s, is back in the US\nCan't wait to be fettered by an unreasonable sense of responsibility to an unfeeling collection of pixels again!\nTODAY'S NUMBER\n170,000\nThat's approximately how many accounts Twitter recently removed that it said were tied to the Chinese government.

While many have been peaceful, those demonstrations have also been marked by violence, vandalism, arson, arrests and allegations of police brutality.\nLast week, the state's US Attorney called for an investigation into why some protesters were being taken by federal agents without badges and put into unmarked vehicles.\nOver the weekend, protesters pulled down barricades, moved them into streets, and attempted to light a building on fire. Sunday's demonstrations ended with protesters being dispersed with gas by federal law enforcement, the Portland Police said in a tweet.\nWhile the protests are now getting national attention, allegations of racism and calls for reform have long been a part of the city.\nWhy did the protests start?\nThe death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police officers in May was the spark that lit demonstrations nationwide, with tens of thousands demanding police reform, accountability and, above all, re-establishing that Black Lives Matter.\nIn Portland, like so many cities across the country, demonstrations are calling for justice in the deaths of Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Elijah McClain and countless other Black lives that have ended in violence.\nA Navy veteran says he was beaten and pepper sprayed by authorities while attending his first protest in Portland\nBut what began as a call for justice and accountability has given way to a melting pot of demonstrations.\nProtests have ranged from peaceful Black Lives Matter marches during the day to unidentified protesters taking part in violent demonstrations that devolve into arson and vandalism. President Trump and other federal officials have characterized some of these events as the actions of \"anarchists and agitators.\"\nNow weeks have gone by with officers and protesters clashing, resulting in injuries on both sides, vandalism, arson, and allegations of brutality.\nIn the last week alone, at least 40 protesters were arrested on charges varying from resisting arrest to disorderly conduct, according press releases from the PPB.\nA history of racism\nPortland has long been a place where tensions between opposing demonstrators have been a source for conflict.\nIn recent years, some protests have become a target for hate groups seeking to antagonize other people who come out to defend the rights of marginalized communities such as immigrants, people of color and members of the LGBTQ community.\n\"History will tell you that it's a racist city, which it is and has been,\" said Sam Sachs, a community member who spoke during a press conference held by the Portland Police Association Sunday. \"Oregon was created as White utopia.\"\nOregon's complicated racial tensions start in the 1800's, with laws put in place to keep people of color out of the state. The 14th Amendment was not passed there until 1868, which given citizenship to Black people.\nIn the early 1900's, the city's Board of Realty passed a \"code of ethics,\" which prohibited realtors from selling homes in White neighborhoods to Black people.\nDemonstrations have been filling the streets nightly.\nThis hasn't been lost on the community. Sachs, whose family has been in the area since the 1940's, founded the No Hate Zone, -- an organization which is focused on ending hate and racism through education, engagement and advocacy.\nWhile he said that right now Portland is known as a \"hotbed for violence,\" it is also \"a city of opportunity.\"\n\"(It's) a city of love. A city of growth. A city that cares about its police. A city that cares about its Black and indigenous community members, gay, lesbian, transgender, cares about everyone. Portland is a city of love and hope.\"\nMany other community members who spoke echoed his sentiments and decried the violence that has come with the calls for justice.\nPastor J.W. Matt Hennessee, who was also present during the press conference, said while he understands that citizens are tired of the brutality they see at the hands of police, he's tired of the violence, division and continued racism he and his community have faced.\n\"You want to know what tired looks like, ask us what tired looks like. Because we are the ones who couldn't purchase a house or rent a place anywhere near a certain place because nobody wanted people like us to be in it.

They don't even know who's pulling them into the vans.\"\nThere are \"dozens if not hundreds of federal troops descending upon our city, and what they're doing is they are sharply escalating the situation,\" the mayor added. \"Their presence here is actually leading to more violence and more vandalism.\"\nAfter people were seen being taken by federal officers without badges and put into unmarked vans, US Attorney Billy J.

LGBTQ rights\nThe Supreme Court delivered a huge win for LGBTQ rights by ruling that federal civil rights law protects gay, lesbian and transgender workers. The opinion, written by Justice Neil Gorsuch, argues, \"An employer who fires an individual for being homosexual or transgender fires that person for traits or actions it would not have questioned in members of a different sex. Sex plays a necessary and undisguisable role in the decision, exactly what Title VII forbids.\" The landmark 6-3 ruling yesterday will extend protections to millions of workers. It's also a clear rebuke of the White House's recent attempts to cut into LGBTQ protections. The White House has argued that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which bars discrimination based on sex, does not cover gender identity and sexual orientation. The administration last week announced it was scrapping regulations that bar discrimination in health care against patients who are transgender.\nToobin: This is fascinating and enormously important 01:36\n2. North Korea\nNorth Korea has blown up -- as in, completely destroyed -- an office used for talks between itself and South Korea. If ever there were a sign that the relationship between the adversaries is deteriorating, this is it. The building has been closed for months due to the coronavirus, but it was obviously a symbol of goodwill between the nations. North Korea says it decided to raze the office as yet another retaliatory measure against South Korea after defectors used balloons to send anti-North Korean leaflets north of the DMZ. The country recently announced it is cutting all ties with South Korea over the incident and will remilitarize parts of the Korean border that have been dormant for years. It's illegal -- and extremely risky -- for average North Koreans to consume literature or entertainment that's not approved by the government.

A man was shot and wounded last night during a protest in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and police suspect vigilante groups may be to blame. In Portland, Oregon, police closed parts of downtown and declared a civil disturbance after a police officer was hit in the head with a large rock. In New York City, three police officers were briefly hospitalized after drinking shakes from Shake Shack that may have been tainted with bleach; the NYPD found \"no criminality\" by restaurant employees.

The order will establish a national certification system for law enforcement agencies and a database to better track excessive use of force by officers nationwide, plus encourage departments to shore up mental health resources for responses related to mental health, homelessness and addiction. It's a modest step and leaves the door open for more significant action from Congress. To that end, Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill are working to advance two competing bills. The Democratic measure is more stringent and proposes banning no-knock warrants and chokeholds.

But the most difficult question may be the one they're asking themselves.\nGoogle says searches for the term, \"Am I racist,\" have spiked in recent weeks to an all-time high. Floyd's death at the hands of a White police officer has sparked a racial awakening in the US. Support for the Black Lives Matter movement has surged, and White people are snapping up books like \"How to Be an Antiracist\" and \"White Fragility.\"\nBut a Google search and a few books can only go so far in answering such a complex and loaded query.\nSo CNN called some activists, psychologists and historians and asked them: How would you help White people answer that question?\nFirst, let's define racism\nThe first step in self-knowledge is defining what it means to be a racist, and defining racism itself.\nWornie Reed, a veteran civil rights activist and the director of the Race and Social Policy Center at Virginia Tech, says, \"A racist person is a person who commits racist acts.\"\nThose acts, he says, are backed by a set of beliefs that support the idea that race determines human traits and capacities and makes one race automatically superior to another.\n\"If they do racist things, I'm willing to call them a racist,\" Reed says. \"You can be a racist even if you don't intend to be one.\"\nA protester holds up a homemade sign during a march on June 12, 2020, in New York City.\nAnd racism?

And it operates across an individual, group and societal level.\nThe truth? Everyone has some racist attitudes\nHere's the bad news if you are one of those people asking, \"Am I racist?\"\n\"If you have to ask if you are a racist, you are,\" says Angela Bell, an assistant professor of psychology at Lafayette College in Pennsylvania. \"And if you are not asking if you are a racist, you are.\"\nEverybody living in the United States has internalized stereotypes about Black people.\nMark Naison, professor\nBell's paradoxical response is part of what she and others say about racism: It's almost impossible not to be a racist growing up in the US.

I've got to work on myself.\"\nA lot of anti-racism work today leads to talk about \"implicit bias,\" or \"racial bias.\" Those are terms that describe how racial stereotypes and assumptions infiltrate our subconscious. People can act and think in racist ways without knowing it.\nA protester raises his fist during a rally June 1, 2020, in Las Vegas.\nA classic example of this was a famous experiment in which researchers sent 5,000 fictitious resumes in response to employment ads. Some applicants had White-sounding names such as \"Brendan,\" while others had Black-sounding names, like \"Jamal.\"\nThe applicants with White-sounding names were 50% more likely to get calls for interviews than their Black-sounding counterparts.\nPeople might not think that they have control over racism, and they can't ever get rid of it. It's absolutely within their control.\nAngela Bell, psychology professor\nSome scholars, though, have issues with terms like \"implicit bias.\" They feel it offers people an excuse to justify their racism by claiming, \"My subconscious made me do it.\"\n\"The term racial bias perpetuates the notion that racism is beyond your control, and that's often not the case,\" says Bell, the psychology professor. \"People might not think that they have control over racism, and they can't ever get rid of it. It's absolutely within their control.\"\nIt doesn't matter if you voted for Obama\nIt can be fiendishly difficult, though, for people to see racism in themselves, says Bell, who studies how people fail to recognize their own racism.\nSome of that is because of what psychologists call \"moral licensing and credentialing.\" Translation: A White liberal who brags, \"I would have voted for Obama a third time if I could,\" may be trying to signal that he or she is beyond racism.\nIf you bring Mother Teresa out of the grave and put her in charge of any criminal justice system in any state, she would be -- unless she changed the system -- the greatest practicing racist in the state.\nWornie Reed, activist and scholar\nIn 2009, Stanford University researchers released a study which found that expressing support for Obama made some people feel justified in favoring Whites over Blacks.\nDaniel Effron, who helped conduct the study, said at the time:\n\"This is the psychological equivalent of when people in casual conversation say something like, 'many of my best friends are black.' They say that because they're about to say something else that they're concerned might be construed as prejudiced.\"\nSupporters wave \"Forward\" signs as President Barack Obama speaks at a rally on September 2, 2012, in Boulder, Colorado.\nThere's also the tendency for people to evaluate themselves as superior to others, Bell says.\nShe cites an experiment she helped conduct in which she asked college students to fill out an online questionnaire asking if they had ever engaged in racist behaviors, such as using the N-word.\nMonths later, the same participants were asked to review similar responses from randomly selected students. The catch was that they were actually reviewing their own answers, but they didn't know it.\n\"People evaluated themselves as less racist as the other person,\" Bell says, \"even though the other person was them.\"\nIndividual racism isn't as harmful as institutional racism\nPeople have different ideas about how to get rid of racism. Some say the focus should be on institutional racism -- in schools, policing, the workplace -- and not on people's feelings.\nReed says too many White Americans see \"racism as psychology\" -- a naval-gazing definition that focuses on what people feel inside and personal displays of racial hostility, like racial slurs.\nReed says the goal of the civil rights movement was not to make White people better. It was to purge institutions of racism so that Blacks could have equal access to jobs, housing and education.\nA segregated theater in Leland, Mississippi, in the 1930s.\nNot enough White Americans understand that racism is much more destructive when it infects an institution like the criminal justice system, he says.\n\"If you bring Mother Teresa out of the grave and put her in charge of any criminal justice system in any state,\" he says, \"she would be -- unless she changed the system -- the greatest practicing racist in the state.\"\nHow to tell if you're racist\nA Google search for \"Am I a racist\" offers a quiz, but racist attitudes are too complex to diagnose like that. Naison, however, poses a few questions that may give you a clue.\nAre you surprised when you meet a Black person whose command of language or speech or writing is of the highest order?\nDo you assume that when you meet a Black person in an athletic competition that he or she will be stronger or faster than you?\nDo you feel anxiety when a group of young Black men walk down the street toward you, or a twinge of fear when a Black man checks your gas meter or does home repairs?\nA woman holds a protest sign in Oakland, California, on June 1, 2020.\nIf you answered yes to these you might be a racist, Naison says.\nHe adds that Black people who come in contact with you will probably know you're a racist before you do. Blacks can often read White people's body language when they're experiencing these racist thoughts, he says. It could be something as simple as speeding up your walk when a Black man approaches on the street or hesitating to open your door when a Black man is ringing the bell.\nNaison says a majority of Whites practice what he calls \"aversive racism,\" or engaging in behavior -- some of it unconscious -- \"which lets Black people know they are uncomfortable around them.\"\nHow to not be racist\nOne of the biggest obstacles to fighting racism is despair. There's a belief that racism will never be eliminated because it always adapts to survive, and humans are too tribal to look past superficial differences in others.\nBut the modern framework of racism -- a racial hierarchy with White on top and Black on bottom -- is a relatively recent fabrication. The notion that people with darker skin are inherently inferior was contrived around 500 years ago by Europeans to justify slavery and colonial conquest, scholars say.\nHistory lessons won't prevent someone from being a racist. But something else can: genuine, sustained personal relationships with people of color.\nSustained friendships with people of other races can break down biases, scholars say.\n\"Reading books is a good thing, and participating in study groups is fine, but making your social networks genuinely diverse is critical,\" says Naison, the Fordham professor. \"You can't live in a White bubble.\"\nMost White people, however, are socially isolated from people of other ethnicities, he says. Naison says he goes to the homes and celebrations of White friends and hardly ever sees any people of color.\n\"And these are people who support every possible justice issue, and who march in Black Lives Matter protests,\" he says.\nNaison says he's never had to ask Google, \"Am I a racist?\" because his world is full of people of color who will tell him if he is being a racist.\n\"I've had a great life and I've learned to make this happen,\" he says. \"If I can do it, you can too.\"\nMaybe starting that journey begins with a less self-centered question for Google.\nInstead of \"Am I racist?\" ask yourself:\nWhat am I doing to stop the racism I see in the world?"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/28/us/vancouver-city-council-police-reform-trnd/index.html", "headline": "Vancouver City Council moves to limit police response to issues around mental health, sex work and homelessness", "published_date": "2020-07-28", "text": "(CNN)Local politicians in Vancouver, Canada, are pushing to change its policing strategies, after its City Council passed a motion that would limit police response to mental health, substance abuse and other nonviolent issues -- working instead to fund a community-led initiative.\nThe council's Standing Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities approved the motion, titled \"Decriminalizing Poverty and Supporting Community-led Safety Initiatives,\" on Monday, after being introduced by Councillor Jean Swanson earlier this month.\n\"The City of Vancouver is committed to using an equity lens on social issues which include issues relating to police services,\" the motion reads, also noting that current policing practices disproportionately criminalize Black and Indigenous communities.\nThe motion asks the police board to itemize the work they do relating to mental health, homelessness, drug use and sex work, with the associated costs.

Nearly half of US states are reporting a rise in new cases and some continue to break daily records. And in the South, more young people are testing positive for the virus. Yes, there's more testing, but health officials say the rise in cases has more to do with behavior, i.e. not wearing masks and attending large gatherings. Elsewhere in the world, the coronavirus threat remains. More than 7,000 Brazilians died of the virus in one week, and cases in Latin America have surpassed two million.

While it was meant to celebrate Roosevelt as a \"devoted naturalist and author of works on natural history,\" it also \"communicates a racial hierarchy that the museum and members of the public have long found disturbing,\" the museum said.

But 155 years after the news of their emancipation finally reached slaves in Galveston, Texas, the nation is still struggling with the issues of systemic racism and injustice.\nThat struggle surfaced once again in the national debate and massive Black Lives Matter protests that were sparked by the killing of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police officers on May 25.\nForty-seven states and the District of Columbia mark June 19 as a state holiday or observance. Communities across the country celebrate it with food and festivities. But -- despite a push by activists over the years -- Juneteenth still isn't a federal holiday. And, throughout its history, it has often been overlooked by non-black Americans.\nHere's what to know about Juneteenth.\nWhat Juneteenth is\nJuneteenth -- a blending of the words June and nineteenth -- is the oldest regular US celebration of the end of slavery.\nIt commemorates June 19, 1865: the day that Union Army Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger rode into Galveston, Texas, and told slaves of their emancipation.\nJuneteenth: 8 places to honor the end of slavery\n\"In accordance with a proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free,\" Granger read to a crowd.\nThat day came more than two years after President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863. Even after Lincoln declared all enslaved people free on paper, that hadn't necessarily been the case in practice.\nAfrican Americans and others mark Juneteenth -- also called Emancipation Day -- much like the Fourth of July, with parties, picnics and gatherings with family and friends.\nJuneteenth has been celebrated informally since 1865, but Texas became the first state to make it a state holiday in 1980.\nWhy people are talking about it now\nFor one thing, it's right around the corner.\nAnd on Thursday, President Donald Trump announced that he would hold a June 19 campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma -- the site of one of the worst acts of racist violence the country has ever seen.\n99 years ago today, America was shaken by one of its deadliest acts of racial violence\nIn 1921, tensions between Tulsa's black and white communities culminated in a white mob attacking black residents and burning black-owned businesses in a part of the city known as \"Black Wall Street.\"\nTrump's decision to hold the rally there on a day that commemorates the end of slavery was striking, given events in the aftermath of Floyd's killing. The President has remained mostly silent on issues of systemic racism and has resisted some of the changes proposed by protesters.\nDemocratic lawmakers and progressives sharply criticized the move.\n\"This isn't just a wink to white supremacists -- he's throwing them a welcome home party,\" Sen. Kamala Harris tweeted.\nWhite House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany was asked on Thursday what Juneteenth meant to the President.\n\"The African American community is very near and dear to his heart. At these rallies he often shares the great work he has done for minority communities,\" she said, citing criminal justice reform and funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities.\n\"He's working on rectifying injustices ... So it's a meaningful day to him and it's a day where he wants to share some of the progress that's been made as we look forward and more that needs to be done,\" said McEnany.\nCNN's Doug Criss, Ryan Nobles and Veronica Stracqualursi contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/10/us/martin-gugino-trump-buffalo-tweet/index.html", "headline": "The 75-year-old Buffalo man seriously injured by police 'had a good chuckle' over Trump's tweet", "published_date": "2020-06-10", "text": "(CNN)Martin Gugino is still hospitalized in severe pain almost a week after Buffalo officers pushed him to the ground, causing the elderly man's head to bleed.\nBut after learning President Donald Trump tweeted a conspiracy theory, suggesting Gugino was an \"ANTIFA provocateur,\" the 75-year-old just laughed.\n\"He had a good chuckle out of it,\" said his friend Mark Colville, who spoke to Gugino by phone Tuesday.\nVideo captures Buffalo police push elderly man to the ground 01:46\nGugino, like thousands of Americans across the country, was peacefully protesting Thursday against racial injustice and police brutality after the death of George Floyd.\nEven though Gugino is generally \"shy and reserved,\" he \"takes public action as a matter of conscience and faith,\" Colville said.\n\"Even when he was asked for any public comment, his only comment was that 'black lives matter' and we should continue to protest peacefully,\" Colville said.\nFriends say Gugino is far from an \"ANTIFA provocateur,\" as Trump suggested:\n\"Buffalo protester shoved by Police could be an ANTIFA provocateur. 75 year old Martin Gugino was pushed away after appearing to scan police communications in order to black out the equipment. @OANN I watched, he fell harder than was pushed.

Gugino and Colville struck up a friendship when both volunteered in activism, including with the group Witness Against Torture.\nGugino is a \"peace-making\" man, his friend and fellow activist Kathy Kelly said.\nVideo shows Gugino calmly walking up to police just before he was pushed.

Athletes from professional leagues to high school teams have been kneeling for the anthem in support of the ongoing protests for social justice and racial equality. But the most prominent athlete to take a knee during the anthem has been Colin Kaepernick, who first sat and then kneeled for the anthem in 2016.\nMonday's game was the Giants' first exhibition game of the season.

Videos are automatically uploaded to the organization's server to ensure they are saved even if a phone is seized or destroyed.\nWith protests erupting in at least 30 US cities over the death of unarmed black man George Floyd at the hands of a police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the ACLU is encouraging people to document their interactions with police in case the situation escalates.\nIt's been five decades since 1968, and things are somehow worse\n\"There is no doubt that moments like these highlight the importance of the app,\" Marcus Benigno, a spokesperson for the ACLU of Southern California, told CNN. \"Without a video of the unfortunate and tragic incident, we probably wouldn't even know George Floyd's name.\"\nVideo captured Floyd pleading that he couldn't breathe while being held down with a knee on his neck by a Minneapolis police officer.\nThe ACLU first launched the app following the deaths of unarmed black teenagers Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown, which ignited the Black Lives Matter movement in 2014.\nWhile thousands take to the streets to protest police brutality as unarmed black men continue to die in the hands of law enforcement, Benigno said citizens are encouraged now more than ever to assert their First Amendment right to film law enforcement while they are on active duty in case the situation escalates.\nHow to use the app\nWhen a user goes to their state's Mobile Justice app, they are given an option to record a video which is downloaded to their phone and directly sent to that ACLU chapter for staff to review. Before submitting, users must add a report describing the location of the incident, who was involved, names of the officers in the video if known, and any additional details.\nUsers can also report an incident they witnessed and learn more about their rights to take photos and videos with audio recordings, which differ from state to state.\nIn the upcoming months, the app -- which is currently available in 17 states and the District of Columbia -- will be accessible to everyone in all 50 states while respecting each state's laws, Benigno said.\nAlong with capturing misconduct, the Mobile Justice app also helps deescalate situations between law enforcement and citizens.\n\"The initial goal was to make sure abuses from law enforcement were caught on camera, so we can ultimately reform the system, but what we're seeing is it's not just about capturing abuse,\" Benigno said.\n\"It's become a deescalation tool. It can help people feel empowered while forcing officers to take a second to reevaluate the situation.

It's simply the loop at the end of a rope, under a running knot, which tightens as it's pulled. And yet it has the power to spur shivers of terror.\nIn America, the hangman's noose has come to symbolize a deplorable act of brutality, along with unbound fear and hatred towards African Americans. It's a reminder of America's dark history of racial violence -- a history that NASCAR driver Bubba Wallace and others will tell you in 2020 doesn't feel very distant at all.\n\"The noose always means much more than a knot in a rope,\" said Jack Shuler, an associate professor at Denison University and author of \"The Thirteenth Turn: A History of the Noose.\"\n\"The noose was a tool used to kill people and, therefore, it is a threat -- it is violent speech,\" Shuler added. The noose has become the new burning cross.\"\nHere's why a noose has the power to frighten people -- and how it's still being used today as a symbol of hate.\nIt's a symbol of America's history of lynchings\nThe NAACP estimates that more than 4,700 people were lynched in the US between 1882 and 1968, although Shuler believes the number is probably much higher. Almost 73% of them were Black.\nA flag announcing a lynching is flown from the window of NAACP headquarters in 1936 in New York City.\nMost of the racial lynchings took place in the South, where many whites felt threatened by Black peoples' newfound freedoms and sought to intimidate and control them. Black men were strung up from trees, beaten to death or otherwise lynched for any number of alleged minor crimes.\nThese lynchings weren't even considered murders, according to Shuler.\n\"Lynching is not the same as private murder. It means an extrajudicial killing for an alleged crime by three or more persons,\" Shuler told CNN. \"There must be some evidence that a community supported the act -- either actively or through their collective inaction.\"\nHate groups like the Ku Klux Klan were behind many of the killings. But in some places, entire communities would gather to watch Blacks being tortured and hanged, Shuler said.\nA doll hangs from a noose outside a dorm window on the campus of Mississippi State University in 1962 -- an apparent protest against James Meredith, the first African American student admitted to the segregated University of Mississippi.\n\"Though most often associated with being hanged by a noose, lynching also involved victims being tortured to death, burned alive, or riddled with bullet holes,\" he said. \"Typically, the victim was hanged and then the body was mutilated.\"\nLynchings in the US subsided by the late 1960s. But as a vestige of that shameful era, the noose lives on.\nPeople understand exactly what it means\nThe intention behind using a noose is crystal clear.\n\"If you knew anything about the history of American lynching,\" Shuler said, \"then you wouldn't tie that knot without doing so for the expressed person of threatening another person.\"\nIn recent years, nooses have been found hanging outside the National Museum of African-American History and Culture in Washington, on college campuses and on a fence at an Oakland, California, elementary school.\nAnd whether they realize it or not, every time a person ties a noose and hangs it they are sending a message.\nThese photos of slain Black figures were found hanging from nooses in Milwaukee.\n\"People who make these nooses know what it represents because it's historical,\" said Darryl \"King Rick\" Farmer II, leader of the Black Panthers of Milwaukee, where photos of six slain Black figures were found hung by nooses in a park over the weekend.\n\"Everyone knows what a hangman's noose represents, especially to the African American community. Either they've been living under a rock or they simply don't care.\"\nThe US has seen a flurry of noose incidents in recent months\nOn Sunday a noose was found in a Talladega garage stall used by Bubba Wallace, the only full-time Black driver in NASCAR's top circuit and an outspoken advocate of the Black Lives Matter movement. Days earlier, Wallace had spoken out against displaying the Confederate flag at NASCAR races.\n(The FBI said in a statement Tuesday that the noose was hanging in the garage stall since as far back as October 2019 and that nobody could have known Wallace would be assigned that stall until last week.)\nBubba Wallace on June 10, 2020, in Martinsville, Virginia.\nOn Saturday, laminated cards showing photographs of Breonna Taylor, Eric Garner, Botham Jean, Ahmaud Arbery, Michael Brown and Trayvon Martin -- all Black people killed in encounters with law enforcement or private citizens -- were found hung by nooses from a tree in Milwaukee. The Milwaukee Sheriff's Office is investigating.\nLast week what appeared to be several nooses were found hanging from trees in Oakland, California.\nAnd these are just the most recent episodes.\nIn January, the only Black basketball player at a West Virginia high school found a drawing of a stick figure on a noose with his name. And in February, a 12-year-old girl at a Mardi Gras parade in Mississippi was given a black doll with beads forming a noose around its neck.\nAnd lynching is still not a federal crime\n\"It's important to remember that lynchings didn't end because Congress enacted laws to prevent them. Indeed, Congress never acted,\" Shuler said.\nBipartisan legislation to make lynching a federal crime, a long-sought goal of activists which got new momentum after the recent nationwide protests against police mistreatment of African Americans, is currently stalled in Congress.\nMany White Americans can't comprehend the intensity of this felt history for African Americans, Shuler said.\n\"Lynching is a heinous and historical act that has been perpetrated against African American people. We are sensitive to nooses, we are sensitive to hatred, we are sensitive to the fact that systemic racism across America continues, and these nooses are a representation of that. We as African Americans are angry, appalled, upset, and we are fed up with it,\" said Farmer, the Black Panther leader.\n\"It brings back the terror, the disrespect,\" he added. \"It brings back all the memories of crimes committed against our ancestors and to us until this day.\""}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/26/us/austin-protests-shooting/index.html", "headline": "One dead after shots fired during protests in Austin", "published_date": "2020-07-26", "text": "(CNN)One man is dead and another person was detained for questioning after a shooting during a protest Saturday evening in Austin, Texas, police said.\nThe victim has been identified as Garrett Foster, 28, according to Austin police.\nOfficers were at the scene monitoring protesters gathered in downtown Austin in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement when shots rang out Saturday night, Austin police Officer Katrina Ratcliff said.\nAustin Police Chief Brian Manley said officers responded to a 911 call where the caller stated they had just shot someone who had approached their car window and pointed a rifle at them.\nWhen officers arrived, they began resuscitation efforts on Foster, but he died shortly after at a local hospital, Manley said.\nWitnesses gave many accounts including that the disturbance began when the vehicle started honking its horn, Manley said.

And they were called Mister, and in some cases when blacks were still working in the households even the young white boy would be called Master, or some such thing, and adult white males would call older black men 'boy.'

The governors of Texas and Florida put a pause on relaxing restrictions any further. Younger people are feeling the impact across much of the US, the CDC says. That's especially true in Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis said the median age for positive Covid-19 cases has dropped to 35 years old. Though young folks might be at a lower risk of severe infection, health officials remind people that doesn't mean they're immune. Meanwhile, several sheriffs in North Carolina have said they won't enforce the state's mask mandate. Given the situation, one infectious disease expert warns that the second wave of the virus in the fall could be much worse than even this.\nDr. Gupta demonstrates how to stay safe on a road trip 02:08\n2. Policing\nAnother police use of force incident is under fresh scrutiny. Officials in Colorado announced an investigation into the death of Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old Black man who died last year in police custody. The move comes after more than 2 million people signed a petition urging officials to look into the case again. Incidents in other cities are also attracting attention. New York police said George Zapantis, a 29-year-old bipolar man holding a sword, died Sunday after being Tased by officers. Another city officer was charged after he was seen on video putting a man into a chokehold during a weekend arrest. And in Georgia, court documents indicate a Black man who was slammed to the ground as he was wrongly arrested is suing the city of Valdosta and several officers for excessive force and injury. Democrats and Republicans have called for quick action to address police misconduct, but Capitol Hill is in a stalemate. The House passed a police reform bill yesterday, but it faces an uphill battle in the Senate.\nColorado governor to reexamine case of Elijah McClain's death 03:31\n3. Obamacare\nThe Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to strike down the Affordable Care Act, the landmark health care law that enabled millions of Americans to get insurance coverage. At issue is whether the law's individual mandate was rendered unconstitutional because Congress reduced the penalty for remaining uninsured to zero and, if so, whether that would bring down the entire law. A federal appeals court last year ruled that the mandate was unconstitutional but punted back to the district court on whether the entire law is invalid or some parts can survive. In a late-night filing, the government's top lawyer before the Supreme Court argued that once the law's individual coverage mandate and two key provisions are invalidated, the rest of the law \"should not be allowed to remain in effect.\" It's not clear if justices will hear arguments before the November election. This will be the third time the court has heard a significant challenge to the law.\nBattleground states could be hit hard by Obamacare unraveling (December) 04:32\n4.

Twenty-four people In the northern state of Uttar Pradesh died due to lightning in the past 24 hours, and at least 83 people in the neighboring state of Bihar were killed in lightning strikes yesterday. India -- and South Asia more broadly -- often has lightning fatalities in May and June. The deaths often occur among farmers, who head outside to prepare their fields just as monsoon rains arrive.

White supremacy\nWhite supremacist groups have become much more active on the social media network Telegram as protests over racism and police brutality sweep the US. That's according to a new report by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a London-based think tank. More than 200 channels, many with thousands of members, include frequent and explicit threats of violence against minority communities and Black Lives Matter protesters, researchers said. White supremacists have made their way over to Telegram because it's less active in moderating content than other social media networks, the report said.

The bridge's namesake, Edmund Pettus, was a Confederate general and leader of the Ku Klux Klan in Alabama.\nAt age 25, Lewis helped lead the 1965 march for voting rights on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, where he and other marchers were met by heavily armed state and local police who brutally beat them with clubs, fracturing Lewis' skull.\nThe day became known as \"Bloody Sunday\" and galvanized Americans' support for the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\nA state trooper swings a billy club at John Lewis, right foreground, in 1965 on \"Bloody Sunday\" in Selma, Alabama.\nMichael Starr Hopkins, 33, launched a petition for the name change on June 17 in hopes the bridge would be renamed while Lewis was still alive.

He went on one Facetime date -- the girl, he said, seemed like she was \"just going through her matches ... like on a spreadsheet.\"\nBut on May 29, he had plans to meet up with a different match -- this time in person. A 28-year-old nurse named Brooke, with whom he would hike Runyon Canyon -- Los Angeles' picturesque, influencer-ridden trail.\nIt was in the middle of their approximately three-mile hike, when the two decided they felt comfortable enough to remove their face masks, that he knew this was different. Their guards were down, or as he described it, \"all caution (regarding coronavirus) was thrown to the wind.\"\nNow, less than one month and many dates later, they split most of their time between his West Hollywood apartment and hers in Long Beach. He's done what many initially considered impossible with social distancing guidelines and stay-at-home orders:\nHe found love during a global pandemic.\n\"This is truly two people finding their soulmate during the most unlikely of times,\" he told CNN in a phone interview. \"We're thinking about eloping to Vegas if the chapels open.\"\nSearching for love in the time of coronavirus\nWhile this may sound extreme, many formerly single people -- and dating experts -- say the pandemic has actually helped people find their matches more easily.\n\"I think people are more likely to find love during this time than not during this time,\" Yue Xu, co-host of the popular \"Dateable\" podcast, told CNN in a video call.\n\"Because we have this dedicated time to find love, there are no distractions -- you're not a bar looking at people around you or looking at your drink. Everyone's more present and they are more conscious about the way they are showing up to these virtual or real-life dates.\"\nXu and podcast co-host Julie Krafchick, who are based in San Francisco, said they've noticed an overall change for the better in terms of the dating landscape over the past few months.\n\"Consider this a reset,\" Xu said. \"Even though we're losing magic of that first date -- the first kiss, first touch -- we're forced to think about how we can reinvent dating.\"\nThe 'fail fast mentality'\nDating has never been -- and never will be -- perfect. Before the pandemic, Xu and Krafchick answered questions on their podcast such as \"Do Millennials even want to find love?\" and \"Is monogamy dead?\"\n\"We can't have amnesia that dating wasn't perfect before,\" Krafchick said. \"Part of the reason we created the podcast in the first place was to answer the question, 'What the f**k is wrong with modern dating?'\"\nThe biggest challenge for the singles out there before the pandemic, Krafchick said, was that many spent a lot of time in relationship limbo.\n\"No one wanted to say they were excited about someone,\" she said. \"No one wanted to define the relationship.\"\nNow, however, the pandemic has led to what Krafchick described as the \"fail fast mentality.\"\n\"People are starting to feel it's better to fail fast than be in this constant state of equilibrium,\" she said. \"Like, let's either get it off the ground or end it.\"\nYue Xu and Julie Krafchick host the \"Dateable\" podcast.\nThe podcast hosts have heard countless stories during these past few months of people who have successfully found love, and people who have felt more encouraged by their dating experiences even if their quarantine relationships didn't work out.\n\"Coming out of quarantine, everyone has a really strong feeling of a yes or no,\" Xu said.\nMany have also taken this time in quarantine to self reflect, which has helped pave the way to finding healthier relationships.\n\"I think this time has given people a lot of clarity into what they want in life,\" Krafchick said. \"It's shown life is short and at the end of the day, relationships are what matters most. A lot of people have used this time to do self work, especially in the dark middle period of quarantine, where it didn't feel like there was any way to meet someone.\"\nVirtual dates have also made people throw their old notions of dating out of the window, as they are forced to get creative. For example, \"there are 'Zootie' calls now,\" Xu explained. \"Zoom booty calls.\"\n'A whole other dimension of consent'\nWith this uncharted era of dating also comes new conversations around consent: Do you feel safe meeting in person during a pandemic? Do you agree to wearing masks on the first date? Do you feel comfortable being less than 6 feet apart?\nJessica Gerhardt, a Santa Monica, California, native, and her new partner -- they have not labeled the relationship yet -- waited three months before they decided to meet in person for the first time last week.\n\"He's way more conscientious than me,\" the musician said of the new guy in her life, who is also a musician.\nJessica Gerhardt and her new partner -- they have not labeled the relationship quite yet -- smile during one of the many video chats they had before meeting in person.\nThe two, who had mutual friends in the music scene, began talking after he \"slid into her DMs\" on Instagram. Before they met up, he researched and looked into data about social distancing, Gerhardt said.\n\"We both consented to hug when we first met,\" the 30-year-old told CNN. \"There's a whole other dimension of consent during this pandemic. Under normal circumstances, of course I'd want to hug -- but it was helpful to have that conversation before and nice to know if we don't do something it's not necessarily a sign of 'Oh, I'm not attracted or interested, but I'm trying to be considerate of your safety and vice versa.'\"\nThe lack of touching before meeting, Gerhardt said, made her feel like the two were cultivating \"deeper intimacy\" as they got to know each other.\nThey ended up going on a social distance walk in her neighborhood while both wore face masks. At the end of their walking date, he asked whether he could use her bathroom before he drove home.\n\"He came inside, and we both took off our masks after I asked, 'Do you feel comfortable being maskless?' and he said, 'I feel comfortable.' It was a nice surprise,\" she said. \"We ended up feeling comfortable enough to also hold hands and cuddle. It was really sweet.\"\nJessica Gerhardt snapped this photo on her first date with her new partner, where they took a walk in her neighborhood, while wearing masks.\nWhile they do not have plans to move in together any time soon, Gerhardt said he has now joined her quarantine pod, which includes her roommate and her roommate's boyfriend.\nLearning each other's values early on\nOn top of the pandemic, these past few months have seen nationwide protests demanding justice and an end to police brutality in the aftermath of the deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and Rayshard Brooks.\nHow people have acted during this time has helped provide a window into their beliefs, which for some singles has helped narrow down their pool of potential matches.\nLove under lockdown: The couples pushed together and kept apart by coronavirus\nFor example, on dating apps, many have said they have encountered photos of people holding \"Black Lives Matter\" signs at protests on their profiles. Others said they've seen people sporting face masks in their pictures, to highlight the fact that they are following social distancing guidelines recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in order to curb the spread of the virus.\n\"With the Black Lives Matter movement, Covid, and everything else that's been going on, it's been causing people to have way deeper conversations,\" Krafchick said. \"You can really quickly realize who has same values as you and who would be a better long-term partner. (Talking about) those things can really help you understand someone a lot better on a deeper level and get you past those basic dating questions.\"\nLiz Dwyer, who lives in LA, fell for a guy named Demis Courquet-Lesaulnier, who she has been messaging on Instagram since before the pandemic. He lives in Paris, and they had plans -- pre-coronavirus -- to meet abroad. Now, that plan has been put on hold.\nBut that hasn't slowed their relationship down at all. In fact, it's sped things up. Dwyer said she's gotten closer to her now-boyfriend these past few months virtually, thanks to many of the current events they discuss.\n\"We have completely different cultural backgrounds,\" the writer and editor told CNN. \"I'm American, he's French. I'm Black, he's White. We had to get to know each other -- not just on the 'I think you're good looking' and 'you're cute too' conversation.\"\nDwyer said Demis created a list of 54 films -- including \"BlacKkKlansman,\" \"13th\" and \"When They See Us\" -- \"to try and understand what it's like to be Black in America.\" The two have conversations about them, and discuss what he noticed, observed and learned from them. He even wrote a post titled \"A Love Letter to Black America\" to reflect on his takeaways.\n\"He was open to understanding what was happening in terms of racism,\" she said.\nWithout the pandemic, she doesn't know what their relationship would look like today.\n\"I don't know what the future holds,\" she added, \"but no matter what, the experience has changed me for the better.\"\nFinding your 'apocalypse partner'\nRonni Morgan, 32, and her partner Adriane (AJ) Johnson, 41, met on the HER app -- a dating app for queer people -- on March 23.\nThey started by texting, having FaceTime dates and watching Netflix together virtually, with Morgan in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and Johnson in Grand Rapids, Michigan.\nWhen they finally reached a point where they felt safe enough to start planning an in-person meeting, they found an AirBnB in between their two locations that they considered secluded and off-the-beaten path.\nFrom the beginning, Morgan said, the two were \"on the same page about how to handle the pandemic.\"\n\"We have both taken it very seriously,\" Morgan told CNN. \"I don't think we would've made it this far otherwise.\"\nWhen they finally did meet, on June 26, Morgan said their weekend together \"legitimately was like a lesbian romance novel, complete with a fireplace, velvety red blanket and epic thunderstorm.\"\n\"When we did finally get to meet in person, we were already so deeply connected there was no question of what the chemistry would be like,\" she told CNN.\nTheir relationship is still a long-distance one -- but Morgan said there's no doubt in her mind that she's found her \"apocalypse partner,\" aka the person to ride out the pandemic with.\n\"There's this meme that talks about how dating in 2020 is about choosing your apocalypse partner wisely and honestly I couldn't agree more,\" Morgan said. \"I can say, without a shadow of a doubt, there's no one I'd rather be braving the new world with than AJ.\"\nThe two have created a Facebook page and Instagram page dedicated to their love story.\n\"I never imagined I'd meet the love of my life during a global pandemic but here we are,\" Morgan wrote in a post sharing their story on Facebook.\n\"Anything is possible.\"\nMeeting at the virtual bar\nBack in March, Krafchick and Xu decided to bring their community of listeners together in a Facebook group they called \"Love in the Time of Corona by the Dateable Podcast.\" They said they felt it was important for people to feel less alone as quarantine began.\nYue Xu and Julie Krafchick take a selfie while hosting their podcast.\nSo far, the group has amassed more than 500 members -- who all actively utilize the group to share their experiences with dating in comments, over virtual happy hours, and, sometimes even with the two hosts as guests on their show.\nThursday afternoon, a \"Dateable\"-hosted virtual happy hour was in full swing, with about 20 people from across the United States -- some returning faces, others new to the hangout -- hopping on a video chat on Facebook.\nGroup members could check out different Facebook rooms, including: \"The Bar,\" where Krafchick and Xu kicked off the afternoon with intros. Then, some stayed behind to play a game of \"Would You Rather?\" with dating-themed questions.\n\"Would you rather date someone who is in a lot of debt but donates to charity on a regular basis,\" Xu asked the group, \"or someone who has no debt, but doesn't donate to charities?\"\nOthers joined the \"Playtime\" room, where they participated in dating-themed trivia.

He believes it's because racism put President Trump in office and Trump has ignored the pandemic playbook left behind by the Obama administration, which has put American lives at risk.\n\"White supremacy is why Trump is in office,\" says Young, co-founder of a popular blog on race, \"Very Smart Brothas,\" and author of \"What Doesn't Kill You Makes You Blacker,\" a memoir in essays.\n\"White supremacy is why Trump did not heed the warnings left by the Obama administration. And White supremacy is why Covid-19 is so devastating.

Kamau Bell that returns to CNN Sunday night.\nThe childhood lesson W. Kamau Bell never forgot 00:45\nThe show's season premiere deals with White supremacy -- a familiar topic for Young, who has become one of the nation's most sought-after commentators on race. He's been featured on National Public Radio and in Time magazine and has written columns for GQ.\nRacism is a painful topic that can grind down those who write and talk about it for a living. Not so with Young. His columns are insightful and playful, and he's not afraid to criticize Black athletes or public figures. His writings also transcend race, such as a coming-of-age column from last year entitled, \"The Last Time I Got into a Fight.\"\nCNN asked Young five questions about being a Black man at this unique moment in history. Our interview was lightly edited for clarity.\nIs this current willingness by White America to acknowledge anti-Black racism just a passing phase, or do you think it represents a shift that will endure?\nIt's trendy now, today, for White people to be antiracist. It's a status symbol, like owning a Peloton or having a Black friend who has Black friends. But what happens when we move past the gesture, and the incentive to do the rigorous work it requires is a bit cloudier, a bit messier, and the social gratification is less immediate?\nBasically, does this current willingness have integrity? I hope so, but \"hope\" is a few thousand miles from \"believe.\"\nWhat's the difference between this country having a true racial reckoning versus a superficial racial reckoning?\nA true racial reckoning includes, interrogates and eventually extinguishes all systems of oppression. That includes capitalism. That includes patriarchy. It's not carpet cleansing. It's carpet bombing.\nTree of Life Rabbi Myers: A better future requires all of us 00:53\nIf Trump is defeated in November, do you think the Republican Party will abandon White grievance or do you think there will be a Trump 2.0 down the road who will be more sophisticated and less obvious?\nWhen you think of him as less singular and more an element on a continuum of sentient White grievance -- instead of Donald Trump 1.0, he's Woodrow Wilson 9.0 -- the answer is obvious: Of course, the next version is coming. Maybe they're already here.\nWhat is the most difficult part of constantly explaining racism to White people?\nI don't write with the intent of explaining race and racism to White people. I write to articulate and better understand the circus in and outside of my head. I write for catharsis. I write to challenge myself. I write to entertain myself.\nEven when I'm literally writing a race-related explainer, like the one on the difference between a \"Karen\" and a \"Becky\" (a Becky \"weaponizes\" her White privilege while convincing herself that her Whiteness doesn't matter; a Karen \"doesn't even bother to fake it\"), I'm writing to create a thing I'd like to read.\nIf White people leave my work with a greater understanding of race and racism, that's great.\nBut their education is incidental -- the rub, not the steak. And perhaps that's the lesson. That my world revolves around me, not them.\nWe've seen a lot of videos on social media of White people becoming belligerent and even threatening when they're asked to wear a mask in public. Why do you think some freak out when asked to wear masks?\nI think White people have never had to be guests. I'm one of those people who hate the \"shoes-off\" house. I go to someone's party or dinner and I'm asked to leave the shoes at the door. I get annoyed because my shoes are part of my outfit. But their house; their rules.\nOne of the things that's happening in America now is that White people have never been asked to be guests. This all connects back to White supremacy and Manifest Destiny, where people feel that everything they see they have a right to. \"You can't tell me what to do -- I'm a White American.\" And having some pushback against that is causing some hysteria.\nYou watch these videos and it's like, just put on your mask.

In eyewitness video footage of the incident, former officer Derek Chauvin was seen pressing his knee to the Black man's neck for nearly eight minutes as Floyd lost consciousness.\nOfficer in George Floyd's death under review by state police conduct board\nChauvin was charged by prosecutors with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. The three other officers were charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder, and aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter.\nAsked by CNN about what went through his mind as he watched the video of Floyd being killed, police union representative Rich Walker said he was \"horrified.\"\n\"I don't know what was going through Officer Chauvin's mind, but I can say that I don't agree with how it ended,\" said Walker. \"And to this day I still believe that Mr. Floyd should still be here.\"\nThose comments were echoed by Kroll; however, he stopped short of indicating what he thinks should happen to Chauvin -- instead insisting that he did not want to pass judgment on the former officer.\n\"There was a firefighter at the scene saying, you know, 'check him, check him'. The light should have went (sic) off to do that, but we're not going to pass judgment,\" Kroll said. \"The justice system is going to prevail.\"\nBlasting city leadership\nIn attempting to defend Minneapolis police officers from what they view as unfair criticism, union officials took aim at the city's mayor and members of the city council who have recently called for the restructuring of the police department.\nUnion representatives also criticized Minneapolis police department leadership over their decision to allow rioters to set fire to the city's 3rd police precinct building without a show of force by officers to protect the building.\nSgt. Anna Hedberg, a director at the union, said there were officers scrambling to get their belongings out of the 3rd precinct before it fell. \"That's just ... that was one of the hardest things to ever watch in my career,\" Hedberg said.\n\"To watch 54 cops that shouldn't have been there get chased down the street because the failed politicians allowed them to be there, knowing full well that they weren't going to send the resources,\" she said.\nWhile police union leaders had no shortage of complaints against politicians who have been vocal in calling for policing reforms in the wake of Floyd's death, union leaders were unwilling to outline any specific proposals they would currently be willing to support.\nCorrections officers say they were barred from Derek Chauvin's floor because of their skin color\nAfter the killing of Floyd, the Minnesota governor called a special session of the state's legislature in hopes of pressing forward on a package of possible reforms, including reducing police violence, and efforts geared towards ensuring greater police accountability and transparency. Those efforts appeared to stall as the special session came to a close late last week with numerous reform bills still pending.\nAsked repeatedly by CNN what pieces of legislation they would support, Minneapolis police union officials said they had not yet had time to read the multiple bills put before the state's legislative bodies, and warned that hastily rushing through policing reform measures could have unintended consequences.\n\"We need time,\" said Kroll, adding, \"everybody's got to take a breath.\"\nA controversial president\nEven before the police encounter that resulted in the death of George Floyd, union president Bob Kroll found himself in the national spotlight for both controversial public statements and for actively engaging in partisan campaigning for President Donald Trump.\nPresident Donald Trump shakes hands with Minneapolis Police Union head Bob Kroll on stage during a campaign rally at the Target Center on October 10, 2019 in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\nIn 2016, Kroll referred to Black Lives Matter -- the diffuse group now responsible for organizing many of the primarily peaceful protests against police violence across the country -- as a \"terrorist organization,\" and said he did not see BLM as \"a voice for the black community in Minneapolis.\"\nAsked by CNN whether he stood by those comments, Kroll doubled down, saying he equates parts of the Black Lives Matter movement with domestic terrorism.\nKroll also defended his attendance on stage at a 2019 Trump campaign rally in Minnesota, saying he and his colleagues were unhappy with a statement at the time by the city's mayor indicating Trump was not welcome in the city.\n\"The Obama administration and the handcuffing and oppression of police was despicable,\" Kroll said as he stood next to the President wearing a 'Cops for Trump' shirt. \"The first thing President Trump did when he took office was turn that around,\" he added.\nIn 2007, Kroll was named in a racial discrimination lawsuit from five Minneapolis African American officers, in which they allege Kroll referred to then-US Rep.

I see it all.\"\nThe death of Miller, a Black businessman and community leader who was choked to death by NYPD officers in June 1978, became a flashpoint for Brooklyn activists. His death spurred a summer of protests and the formation of \"cop watches\"\u202f-- groups of Brooklyn residents monitoring police behavior while donning their signature green jackets emblazoned with Miller's face. They now remain largely forgotten outside of Brooklyn.\nWith no cellphones to capture video or social media to amplify the incident,\u202faccounts of Miller's death exist\u202f in newspaper clippings and the memories of those who witnessed it.\nArthur Miller, businessman, community leader\nArthur Miller was born in Nassau, Bahamas, to a family who immigrated to America when he was a teenager.\nAfter arriving in Crown Heights, Brooklyn -- a neighborhood that has long served as a hub for Caribbean immigrants -- Miller thrived as an entrepreneur, his hands busy with several business and community projects. Construction became Miller's primary trade, but he also owned a grocery store on Nostrand Avenue.\nMiller -- who played the congas, trumpet and guitar to the delight of his family -- also excelled as a community leader. He led Four Block Association, a group that received a federal grant to hire local residents as a trained neighborhood watch.\n\"This was a guy who had never should have been attacked by the police,\" Bob Law, a Crown Heights activist and DJ, told the Brooklyn Historical Society.\nBy spring of 1978, Miller was planning to open up\u202f a club on Nostrand Avenue, one that would include a skating rink for children and a nightclub for adults.\nHe was to call it \"LoLisa's VIP.\"\nA fatal encounter\nOn June 14, 1978, Sam Miller, Arthur's brother, was pulled over by police on Nostrand Avenue while driving one of Arthur's trucks. Police made the stop to serve a previous violation for littering, which led to police discovering\u202f Sam had a suspended license, according to an 1983 NYPD report on cases of alleged police brutality published in a Congressional report.\nThe NYPD report says Arthur was attempting to assist Sam before Sam fled the scene chased by two officers. In the report, the NYPD claims Miller then \"became more violent in protesting his brother's arrest\" and that two officers attempted to arrest Arthur but he \"violently resisted efforts to handcuff him.\"  \nAccording to the NYPD account: \"All witnesses agreed that a violent struggle took place, but witnesses disagreed as to whether Miller was struck by nightsticks, whether the police had headlocks on Miller, and whether a nightstick was ever locked on Arthur Miller's neck.\"\nOne eyewitness told the New York Daily News (in a report republished by the Philadelphia Daily News) that \u202fArthur approached the officers with his hands raised in the air, saying \"can't we talk this over?\" According to the same eyewitness, as\u202f Miller raised his hands, officers saw a gun in his waistband -- one he was legally permitted to carry -- and charged.\n\"This white detective runs up behind Arthur and shoves him down. They handcuff Arthur's hands behind his back,\" the witness said.\u202f\"Then they got him kneeling on the sidewalk here, and one of them comes from behind and hold a nightstick across Miller's Adam's apple. The rest of the cops, they start beatin' on him.\"\nWitnesses \u202fsaid they could \u202fsee foam coming from Miller's mouth as he was shoved into a police car\u202f with his legs sticking out of the vehicle's window, according to a New York Times report. According to the NYPD report, \"Officers said Miller was conscious and struggling, but some civilian witnesses said he appeared to be unconscious.\"\nArthur Miller was pronounced dead on arrival at St. Mary's Hospital.\nWhen\u202f Arthur's wife,\u202f Florence Miller, found him\u202f at the hospital, he had multiple pairs of broken handcuffs on his wrist, according to LoLisa.\n\"He was fighting for his life,\"\u202fshe said through tears. \"Trying to make it back home to his wife and his children.\"\nA movement born\nMiller's death sent shockwaves throughout Brooklyn.

In a press release following the Grand Jury's deliberation, the Kings County District Attorney's Office described the\u202f crushing of\u202f Miller's larynx\u202f as a\u202f \"tragic unforeseeable accident which occurred during a lawful arrest,\" according to the NYPD report to Congress. It added that \"Arthur Miller was not savagely beaten by anyone.\"\nThe district attorney concluded that officers used \"uniformly recommended procedures\" when restraining Miller.\nThe NYPD report to Congress concluded: \"The United States Attorney for the Eastern District conducted an investigation and reached essentially the same conclusion as the Brooklyn District Attorney's Office. A US Justice Department investigation into this matter found no police wrongdoing.\"\nNo officers involved were ever fired or criminally charged for Miller's death.\nMiller's death and the protest movement it spurred is remembered as a formative moment for a generation of Black politicians and activists coming of age in New York.\n\"Mr. Miller's death really started a tidal wave of energy around Black activism,\" Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams told CNN. \"That event was the spark that gave way to the blaze of activism that we're experiencing now.\"\n\"Arthur Miller's death left a large imprint on our community, well before there were hashtags and social media tags to amplify the issues of the day,\" Congresswoman Yvette D.

The incident turned Joseph, who was never much of a drinker before, into an alcoholic, she says.\n\"The whole incident just turned him inside out,\" Florence said.\nArthur's son, Arthur Miller 3rd, was 12 years old when his father died. At the funeral, Artie, as he is known to his family, had to be physically restrained from jumping into the grave as the casket was descending, according to LoLisa.\n\"He didn't want to live anymore,\" LoLisa said.\nLoLisa Miller-Bradford, Roz Miller-Lloyd and Vallorie Miller hold a photo of their father Arthur Miller at the cemetery where he is buried.\n\"He lost a lot of interest in things. He wanted to play basketball. He was good at it, but he didn't seem to want it anymore. That wasn't important to him anymore,\" Florence said. \"It changed their lives in a negative way. It took away their childhood. It left an empty void.\"\nToday is different\nPhotos of the protests that followed Miller's death depict a largely Black crowd, in contrast to the multi-racial protests that have sprung from the wake of George Floyd's death.\nFor some Black leaders, one explanation lies in the pervasiveness of cell phone videos, including the one that recorded Floyd's death.\n\"People can actually witness what many people in Black communities have been saying, have been screaming about, for decades,\" said Thenjiwe McHarris, a strategist at Movement for Black Lives. \"You now have millions of people that cannot deny what's happening to Black people.\"\n\"I am certain that many Black deaths would have gone unspoken, uninvestigated and ignored if it weren't for video evidence of these horrific cases,\" said Congresswoman Clarke.\nAdded Reverend Herbert Daughtry: \"The atrocities have become more pervasively shown.\"\n\"For our community, it's more enraging because this is what we've been saying forever,\" said Lumumba Akinwole Bandele, an organizer with the Movement for Black lives, who was a young child in Brooklyn when Miller died.\u202f\"Our stories are never believed.\"\nReverend Daughtry, 89, says he's in awe of young activists he sees on the streets today. \"These people are out there in the street and they're putting their lives on the line for a cause.\"\nHe says his wife has prohibited him from protesting, and she has threatened to leave him if he joins the protests.\n\"I'm 89 years old, I can't afford to get kicked out,\" said Reverend Daughtry. \"My marching ability has been seriously reduced.\"\nAt Miller's grave, in a small cemetery in Dania Beach, Florida, LoLisa stands beside her older sister, Roz Miller-Lloyd.

George Floyd\nColonial slave trader statue torn down amid global protests 02:00\nFormer Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin will appear in court today exactly two weeks after George Floyd's death. Chauvin was the officer filmed on video with his knee on Floyd's neck before he died. He's been charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Also today, a third and final memorial service will be held for Floyd in Houston, where he grew up. These key developments come after a second weekend of protests that have gone global, and grown to encompass more issues of systemic racism and police brutality. In the UK, protesters toppled a statue of 17th-century slave trader Edward Colston, echoing several instances in the US where Confederate monuments have been defaced, removed or designated for removal. In Brazil, protesters gathered in support of Black Lives Matter, and to protest President Jair Bolsonaro's government, including its handling of the coronavirus pandemic.\n2. Police reform\nMinneapolis city council announces intent to defund police 02:17\nNine members of the Minneapolis City Council say they intend to defund and dismantle the city's police department. Council President Lisa Bender says they may shift police funding toward community-based strategies instead, and discuss how to eventually replace the current police force -- though Bender stressed that is \"not in the short term.\" The nationwide spread of anti-racist protests have led to calls to defund or outright abolish police departments, and some cities are considering other changes. In New York City, Mayor Bill De Blasio says the city will move some of its funding from the New York Police Department to youth and social services. Last week, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti agreed to slash between $100 million to $150 million from the Los Angeles Police Department's proposed $1.86 billion budget.\n3. Coronavirus\nManufacturer: Only enough remdesivir for 200K patients worldwide 02:24\nThe US government's current supply of remdesivir, the only drug known to work against Covid-19, will run out at the end of the month according to a US Department of Health and Human Services official. Gilead Sciences, the company that makes the drug, is ramping up to make more, but it's unclear how much will be available this summer. In the long term, the company plans to have more than 500,000 treatment courses available by October, and more than a million by December.Though it's not a cure, remdesivir has been shown to reduce hospital stays for some Covid-19 patients. Meanwhile, the global coronavirus death toll passed 400,000 this weekend, a sobering reminder that, despite waves of reopenings, the pandemic is an ongoing threat.\n4. Economy\nUS economy added 2.5 million jobs in May 01:06\nEmployers added 3.1 million jobs in May, giving an unexpected boost to a battered labor market. But state and local governments are still cutting jobs, which could kill any real economic momentum. Among the growth last month, these two levels of government actually slashed more than half a million jobs. One analytics firm predicts 3 million more state and local jobs could be at risk in coming months, including first responders and in areas like social services, sanitation, health care, education and municipal services like libraries and parks. And while the economy might be doing better now, there may be more bad news around the corner. Economists believe a second wave of infections could deaden a rebound and put the American economy in new danger.\n5. South China Sea\nWhy it matters who owns the seas 03:48\nMaritime and military experts are worried that China is adopting increasingly forceful tactics in the South China Sea. The Asia Maritime Transparency Institute revealed Chinese and Malaysian ships were locked in a high-stakes standoff in the highly-contested area earlier this year. Beijing claims it was conducting \"normal activities in waters under Chinese jurisdiction,\" but Chinese vessels have been accused for years of hounding countries who try to explore in the areas of the South China Sea that China claims as its own. The Malaysia standoff was also one among many confrontational moves from the Chinese government in the region this year. The AMTI says these incidents could lead to larger conflicts with other powers in the area, including Malaysia or Indonesia.\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\nUFC Champion Conor McGregor is retiring\nAt least, for now.

Jones attended Southern Baptist churches, Sunday schools, even a Southern Baptist college.\nBut it was only in seminary, in his mid-20s, that Jones says he learned the full truth about Southern Baptists' white supremacist roots. The denomination was founded to defend slavery and did not formally rebuke its past until 1995, when Southern Baptists voted to apologize for their history of racism.\nJones was a social scientist before he realized how stubbornly racist ideas can persist in White churches.\n\"White Christian churches have not just been complacent; they have not only been complicit,\" he writes in his book, \"White Too Long: The Legacy of White Supremacy in American Christianity,\" publishing next month.\n\"Rather, as the dominant cultural power in America, they have been responsible for constructing and sustaining a project to protect White supremacy and resist Black equality,\" he writes. \"This project has framed the entire American story.\"\nRobert P. Jones\nIn the book Jones, CEO and founder of Public Religion Research Institute, blends church history, memoir and contemporary public opinion surveys. Together, they make a clear and compelling case for why White American Christians need to reckon with their past.\nBut American Christianity's past is only part of the problem.\nIn survey after survey, said Jones, contemporary white Christians repeatedly deny that structural racism is a problem, that shootings of unarmed Blacks are not isolated incidents, or even that African Americans still face racism and discrimination.\nWhite non-Christians, on the other hand, more often agree with Blacks about racial discrimination, according to public opinion surveys.\nSo what gives? Why would White Christians be more reluctant to see racism than their non-Christian counterparts?\nIf that's the question that animates \"White Too Long,\" the answer will be challenging, if not deeply unsettling for many White Christians.\nCNN spoke to Jones recently about why so many White Christians turn a blind eye to racism, how white supremacy took hold of American culture and what Christians can do now to make amends.\nWhat prompted you to write this book?\nWhenever we asked questions about race or African Americans there was a huge gap between Whites who are Christian and those who are not. Whites who are not Christian were always closer to the attitudes of African Americans.\nSeeing that pattern over and over made me realize that something deeper is going on. And coupled with my own experience of growing up in the South and this current moment, I realized that these issues are not being dealt with well. Most White Christians try to ignore them.\nTo that point, it seems like more White evangelicals than we've seen in the past are speaking out against the recent killings of Black Americans by the police and vigilantes. Joel Osteen, who is often studiously apolitical, marched in a Black Lives Matter protest. Some evangelicals are even mentioning systemic racism, which they've been slow to acknowledge in the past. What do you make of their responses?\nOne measure of authenticity for White Christians is whether they link reconciliation with justice and repair. It's easy for a White Christain leader to jump in a march and put his arm around an African-American pastor. But will we see Joel Osteen preach a sermon calling for White Christians to reflect on the ugly parts of our history? Are pastors going to help White Christians free their faith from privileged claims of whiteness?\nOne of the challenges, historically, has been that the Christian theology developed in White churches intentionally blinds White Christians to racial injustice. White Christians are nearly twice as likely as non-religious Americans to say police shootings of unarmed black men are isolated incidents. That is a moral and theological problem.\nPastor Joel Osteen attends a march in honor of George Floyd on June 2, 2020 in Houston, Texas.\nWe've heard some Christian leaders denounce racism in clear moral terms, but that doesn't seem to filter down to the pews, according to surveys. And that's a problem not only for White evangelicals but Catholics and others, right?\nYes, that's true not only for evangelicals but Catholics and the more liberal mainline Protestant leaders. They've put out a number of statements and press releases, but historically they have not landed at the parish or congregational level. And that's where theology gets built: at the local level.\nThe hymns sung, the scripture passages preached, how people understand salvation, none of that has been deconstructed. It was all built for a world in which White Christians needed to shield their institutions and beliefs from claims of injustice by African Americans.\nYou can see that in the way Black Catholics were forced to sit in the back of the church and receive Communion last, and in the way the Southern and Northern branches of Methodism realigned after the Civil War but still didn't admit Black churches as equal members.\nWhy have so many White Christians been so slow to recognize the racism in their past, as well as the racism that continues in America?\nAs long as White supremacy has a hold on our culture, it's pretty comfortable for White Christian churches to say their theology is about personal salvation and personal lives. Theology has been constricted to be only about personal piety, disconnected from claims of social justice. Everything outside of salvation has been labeled \"politics.\"\nIt's a self-protective move. If you read sermons in Mississippi in the 1950s and 1960s you would have no idea that there was a Civil Rights movement. It was a lulling of white consciences to sleep.\nWorshipers leaving an American church in the 1950s. \"If you read sermons in Mississippi in the 1950s and 1960s you would have no idea that there was a civil rights movement,\" Jones says.\nBut what about now, this moment?\nI see the last four years as a moment of reckoning for White Christians. The election of President Trump, who has put White supremacy front and center, has brought these issues from just barely below the surface into plain view. Charlottesville changed things. Charleston changed things. Dylan Roof was a confirmed Lutheran, who, in his journal while imprisoned has been drawing crosses and white Jesus and is completely unrepentant.\nWhite Christians have inherited a worldview that has Christians on top of other religions, men over women, Whites over Blacks. There is a top-down authoritarian structure to it.\nWhat, if anything, can change that?\nIn the book, I write about two Baptist churches in Macon, Georgia, one White and one Black, who have built trust and a partnership in a way that allowed White Christians to be challenged about their assumptions. White Christians don't have the critical distance to do that for themselves. They have to put themselves in community with African American Christians. And frankly, even with that, it's going to be a long journey."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/18/us/richmond-suit-robert-lee-statue-trnd/index.html", "headline": "Six Virginia residents sue to keep Robert E.

House Democrats put forth sweeping legislation aimed at cracking down on police brutality and recording misuse of force, the first concrete step toward action from Washington as a national movement emerges.

Police reform\nPowerful police unions across the country are digging in as political and public attention shifts toward reform. Police unions in the US wield significant political power and enjoy higher membership rates than many other unions, which could lead to significant political clashes as cities explore changes to police departments. Cities like Minneapolis, Los Angeles and New York are already making changes, but leaders of other cities like Atlanta and Houston say there are other ways to address issues raised by recent events. In Florida, a chapter of the Fraternal Order of Police said it is open to hiring officers who have been fired or quit over alleged misconduct. Among those are the Buffalo 57, dozens of officers from the New York city who resigned after two officers were suspended after they were filmed pushing a 75-year-old protester to the ground.\nDemocrats propose legislation to reform police force 02:09\n3. Coronavirus\nThe World Health Organization says the spread of the coronavirus through asymptomatic carriers appears to be rare, upending a lot of assumptions about how the virus spreads. Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO's technical lead for coronavirus response, said data from detailed contact tracing programs -- that is, programs that track whom infected people come in contact with -- shows very few secondary infections caused by people with no symptoms. However, other experts point out there is a difference between truly asymptomatic carriers and people who haven't shown symptoms yet or have extremely mild ones. Meanwhile, 22 US states have seen their case numbers jump back up in recent days following reopenings and relaxed guidelines. Florida alone has seen a 46% increase in cases over the last week.\nBlack light experiment shows how quickly a virus spreads 02:13\n4.

Airline stocks are also rising as Americans prepare to take to the skies again, hopefully signaling an end to months of near-paralysis in the industry. All in all, this strong start to the week is a continuation of the remarkable turnaround for US stocks, which plunged into a bear market in mid-March.

Here's what happened next", "published_date": "2020-06-09", "text": "(CNN)Last week, Minneapolis officials confirmed they were considering a fairly rare course of action: disbanding the city police department.\nIt's not the first locale to break up a department, but no cities as populous have ever attempted it. Minneapolis City Council members haven't specified what or who will replace it if the department disbands.\nCamden, New Jersey, may be the closest thing to a case study they can get.\nMinneapolis City Council members intend to defund and dismantle the city's police department\nThe city, home to a population about 17% of Minneapolis' size, dissolved its police department in 2012 and replaced it with an entirely new one after corruption rendered the existing agency unfixable.\nBefore its police reforms, Camden was routinely named one of the most violent cities in the US.\nNow, seven years after the old department was booted (though around 100 officers were rehired), the city's crime has dropped by close to half. Officers host outdoor parties for residents and knock on doors to introduce themselves. It's a radically different Camden than it was even a decade ago. Here's how they did it.\nWhy departments dissolve police\nA city's decision to dissolve its police department is often a matter of money -- and the cities that chose to do so are often quite small. Camden comes closest to Minneapolis in its size and history of misconduct.\nEarlier this year, the village of Deposit, New York, dissolved its department because it cost $200,000 per year. Now, a single sheriff's deputy is assigned to the village, CNN affiliate WICZ reported. Garden City, Missouri, laid off all of its officers and suspended its police chief because, as its mayor said in 2018, the city couldn't afford to keep them employed.\nIn a bizarre move, Rio Vista police leadership abruptly left the department, and half of the remaining officers left for other jobs, so the California city's department could no longer go on, CNN affiliate KCRA reported in January.\nLt. Zack James of the Camden County Metro Police Department marches along with demonstrators in Camden.\nCamden dissolved its police department to root out corruption.\nThe city's crime rate was among the worst in the US. Within nine square miles and among nearly 75,000 residents, there were over 170 open-air drug markets reported in 2013, county officials told CNN. Violent crime abounded. Police corruption was at the core.\nLawsuits filed against the department uncovered that officers routinely planted evidence on suspects, fabricated reports and committed perjury. After the corruption was exposed, courts overturned the convictions of 88 people, the ACLU reported in 2013.\nSo in 2012, officials voted to completely disband the department -- it was beyond reform.\nAnd in 2013, the Camden County Police Department officially began its tenure. No other city of Camden's size has done anything quite like it.\nHow the new Camden police changed its approach\nCity officials had two objectives in remaking Camden's police: reduce crippling violent crime and make residents feel safer.\nLouis Cappelli, Camden County freeholder director (another term for a county-level public official), said the department still has a ways to go, but its efforts over the last seven years have been largely successful.\n\"Back then residents of Camden city absolutely feared the police department and members of the department,\" he told CNN. \"They (the residents) wanted that to change.\"\nViolent crimes have dropped 42% in seven years, according to city crime data provided by the department. The crime rate has dropped from 79 per 1,000 to 44 per 1,000, the data shows.\nA Camden County officer grills hot dogs for one of the department's pop-up neighborhood parties.\nCappelli credits the improvement to new \"community-oriented policing,\" which prizes partnership and problem-solving over violence and punishment.\nIt starts from an officer's first day: When a new recruit joins the force, they're required to knock on the doors of homes in the neighborhood they're assigned to patrol, he said. They introduce themselves and ask neighbors what needs improving.\nTraining emphasizes deescalation, he said, and the department's use of force policy makes clear that deadly force is the last option.\nNow, police host pop-up barbecues and pull up in Mister Softee trucks to get to know residents, Cappelli said. They host drive-in movie nights -- recently, the movie of choice was \"The Lion King\" -- along what used to be known as the city's \"Heroin Highway.\"\nThe community-first initiative has made improving diversity within the force a priority, too. Whites are the minority in Camden, so Cappelli said the new department has hired more black and brown officers to serve black and brown residents. (Cappelli didn't have exact numbers for the increase, but said it's improved.)\nCappelli said the new department also hired over 100 officers who previously served the dissolved Camden Police Department. They joined the department, which now employs over 400.\n\"We want to make sure residents of the city know these streets are theirs,\" he said. \"They need to claim these streets as their own, not let drug dealers and criminals claim them.\"\nWhat Minneapolis can learn from criticism of Camden\nCamden and Minneapolis aren't perfect mirrors. The Midwestern metropolis is predominantly white -- 63% of the population -- and less than 19% black. In Camden, less than a quarter of all residents are white, but 42% of the population is black and over 50% is Latino.\nCamden also has about 356,000 fewer residents.\nThe criticisms lodged at Camden, though, may inform how Minneapolis goes about its restructuring.\nCamden County police pose with residents outside a Mister Softee ice cream truck.\nOjii BaBa Madi, a lifelong resident of Camden and Justice Minister at Asbury Community Church, said he's felt no improvement in his relationship with police because many of the new officers don't live in Camden or know the community well.\nAdditionally, the department's racial makeup isn't entirely reflective of the city it serves, he told CNN in an email.\n\"The demographics of the city do not reflect these demographics,\" he said. \"With a white chief, as thoughtful and progressive as he is, and only one African American captain out of seven, both the dynamics and optics of race are a problem.\"\nWhat has improved, he said, is officers' willingness to have a \"productive dialogue\" between police and community leaders like him. And the city \"does feel much safer at the neighborhood level\" since police started shuttering open-air drug markets.\nAs for abolishing police entirely, Ojii said the city is \"far away from any practical de-policed reality\" partly because of the crime that still exists there.\n\"I would prefer to nail some best practices for policing as it should be,\" he said, as the city -- and society -- figures out how to change law enforcement as it exists now.\nA Camden County officer plays basketball with a young resident.\nNyeema Watson, also a lifelong Camden resident who's the associate chancellor for civic engagement at Rutgers University -- Camden, said she thinks the restructuring has had a largely positive impact. Officers are more visible now, and they're building trust and welcoming feedback.\nCamden County Police Chief Joseph Wysocki marched with Camden residents in a \"Black Lives Matter\" protest in May. Hearing him acknowledge the \"rightful pain, anger and frustration\" black residents feel about police brutality was powerful, Watson said.\nWatson and Ojii agreed the city's problems remain unsolved. Those require more work than a shift in law enforcement alone can provide.\n\"We can't police our way out of social issues, unemployment, disproportionate health issues, economic challenges -- these are things that drive crime,\" Watson said.\nWhen the city improves access to education for its residents, they'll better understand systemic racism within law enforcement and how to dismantle it, she said.\n\"There are so many issues in our city, outside of policing, that promote a constant level of tension,\" Ojii said, naming gentrification, poverty and addiction among them. \"In essence, Camden remains a tale of two cities.\""}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/19/us/us-slavery-connections-trnd/index.html", "headline": "Here are seven things you probably didn't know were connected to slavery", "published_date": "2020-07-19", "text": "(CNN)As protesters across the United States continue calling for an end to police brutality and racial injustice, organizations are coming to terms with their racist histories.\nThroughout the South, monuments and flags celebrating the Confederacy are being taken down.

It began with a bulletin on 4chan -- the online message board that frequently features extremist content -- according to the Yale Daily News. It then gained steam after Jesse Kelly, host of the nationally syndicated show \"I'm Right with Jesse Kelly,\" tweeted that Yale University was named after slave trader Elihu Yale.\n\"I call on @Yale to change it's name immediately and strip the name of Yale from every building, piece of paper, and merchandise. Otherwise, they hate black people. #CancelYale,\" Kelly's tweet read.\nWhile the motivation behind the hashtag may have been to troll liberals and cancel culture, there is some truth behind Yale's namesake.

In 2017, after months of campus protests, the school changed the name of one of its undergraduate residential colleges to Grace Hopper College from Calhoun College, named after John C. Calhoun, a white supremacist who called slavery a \"positive good.\"\nMany US universities also have ties to slavery. Harvard and Princeton had presidents who owned enslaved people. At public universities like the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the University of Virginia, enslaved people worked on campus or helped build campuses. Some schools, like Georgetown University, sold enslaved people to pay off debts and keep the school running.\nCSX Transportation\nA CSX freight train passes through Homestead, Pennsylvania, on February 12, 2018.\nCSX Transportation owns a railroad that was built by enslaved people.\nThe Richmond, Fredericksburg & Potomac Railroad in Virginia -- acquired by CSX in 2003 -- owned and hired enslaved Black people from 1834, when it was chartered, until the end of the Civil War in 1865, according to The Virginia Museum of History and Culture.\nBank of England joins British companies in apologizing for slavery\n\"The company shares the nation's deep remorse for the shameful institution of slavery and racial discrimination that has occurred in the country,\" Cindy Schild, a CSX spokeswoman, told CNN in an email. \"CSX opposes any form of discrimination and is committed to raising awareness regarding racial disparities.\"\nJack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey\nJack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey.\nThat's right, even alcohol is connected to slavery.\nThough Jack Daniel never owned enslaved people, he did learn to make whiskey in Tennessee from an enslaved person named Nathan \"Nearest\" Green, who was owned by a Lutheran minister, according to the company.\nDaniel bought the business from the minister, then hired Green as his first head distiller.\nMinnesota's constitution still allows slavery as a punishment for crimes. Now lawmakers are trying to change that\nThe New York Times shed light on Green's story in 2016. Since then, Uncle Nearest, a new whiskey brand honoring Green, has emerged. The whiskey is an \"all minority-led business,\" according to its website.\nSvend Jansen, a Jack Daniel's spokesperson, told CNN the company has \"known and been public about the special relationship between Jack Daniel and Nearest Green for many years and it is a common story in Lynchburg, (Tennessee).\" Several of Green's children and grandchildren eventually worked for Jack Daniel's Whiskey, Jansen said.\nJack Daniel's installed a Nearest Green exhibit at its visitor center in March 2018, Jansen said.\n\"We continue to be thoughtful regarding other ways to honor the story of Nearest,\" he said.\nWall Street\nWall Street orignated as a slave market in the 1700s.\nBefore Wall Street became the world's largest stock exchange, the location thrived as a slave market between 1711 and 1762, according to JSTOR Daily, a digital library.\nIn 2015, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio commemorated a marker to the enslaved people who laid the foundation for Wall Street.\n\"This place reminds of us of one of the worst chapters in our history,\" de Blasio said at the time. \"Three-hundred-four years ago, with the approval of the city government, this became a place for buying and selling and renting human beings.\"\nPeople are again talking about slavery reparations. But it's a complex and thorny issue\nNew York City's first lady, Chirlane McCray, said slavery built the foundation of the city and its slave market was rivaled only by the market in Charleston, South Carolina.\n\"You could come here any day and see it happening and somehow it was considered normal in this city. It continued elsewhere in the city for close to 80 years more,\" de Blasio said.\nThe White House and US Capitol Building\nThe exterior view of the south side of the White House.\nFormer First Lady Michelle Obama caused a stir in 2016 when she said enslaved people built the White House. She wasn't wrong.\nConstruction on the original White House began in 1792. Officials planned to import European workers to help build the structure, but recruitment didn't go as planned so they turned to Black people, free and enslaved, according to the White House Historical Association.\nThe US Capitol building was also constructed with the labor of enslaved people. The building's construction started in 1793. Like with the White House, officials struggled to find skilled labor so they turned to enslaved people, who were often rented from owners. Congress unveiled a marker in 2012 honoring the enslaved people who built the Capitol, according to the Architect of the Capitol.\nStorm clouds fill the sky over the US Capitol Building.\n\"So when you see that slave labor was used on the Capitol and White House, it's not just about the personal relationships between the founders and slavery, it's about a national and institutional matter that the government itself was involved in slavery,\" said Adam Rothman, a Georgetown University history professor who specializes in slavery.\nAfter Obama's 2016 comments, the White House Historical Association began aggressively researching slavery and its relationship with US presidents and the White House, said Matthew Costello, a senior historian at the historical association.\nThe research helped form the website \"Slavery in the President's Neighborhood,\" which launched in February.\n\"We have to give those people their voices back. Historically speaking, people are interested in presidents and first ladies, but what about behind those closed doors? Who are the people that really make the White House function and operate?\" Costello told CNN.\nGeorge Washington\nAn oil on canvas of George Washington.\nThough George Washington's ties to slavery are fairly well known, the extent of those connections may surprise some.\nEnslaved people formed part of Washington -- literally.\nThough folklore depicts Washington with wooden teeth, there's no evidence to support that claim, according to historian Alexis Coe, who wrote the best-selling biography \"You Never Forget Your First: A Biography of George Washington.\"\nThe first president's mouth, Coe said, was full of the teeth of walruses, hippopotamuses and enslaved people. Washington paid the enslaved people an under-market rate for their teeth, Coe said.\nCoe said Washington also signed the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793, which allowed enslavers to arrest fugitive enslaved people and reclaim them as property.\n\"The propensity to put Washington on a pedestal does us no favors,\" Coe said. \"It keeps us removed from the man himself, because it's a dishonest reading of his life.\""}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/27/us/dixie-term-south-racism-black-lives-matter-trnd/index.html", "headline": "How the term 'Dixie' came to define the South", "published_date": "2020-06-27", "text": "(CNN)Dixie.\nIt was once a catchall word for the South. There are countless songs about it. Streets still carry the name, as do restaurants and grocery stores.\nBut Dixie has also been a problematic label, carrying with it the ugly remnants of slavery and the exploitation of Black people.\nAs America once again reckons with racial injustice, it's also reexamining this weighty word.\nThis week the country trio the Dixie Chicks said it has changed its name to The Chicks. Dixie Brewery, the oldest brewery in New Orleans, is changing its name to a new brand that \"best represents [their] culture and community.\"\nAnd earlier this year, Miami-Dade County commissioners in Florida voted to rename portions of The Dixie Highway -- it runs 5,786 miles through 10 states from Michigan to Miami -- to Harriet Tubman Highway.\nDixie may have come to define an aspect of life in the South, but exactly how it achieved that is up for debate.\nSo how did the word Dixie originate?\nSeveral theories on where it came from\nHistorians disagree about its origins. Some believe Dixie derives from the Mason-Dixon line, between Maryland and Pennsylvania.\nThe line was drawn in 1767 to resolve a border dispute between the colonies but later became the informal border separating the South and North.\nWhy the noose is such a potent symbol of hate\n\"The other story is a 19th century story about the $10 notes in Louisiana. On the back side it said 'dix,' which means 10 in French,\" said Tammy Ingram, author of \"Dixie Highway: Road Building and the Making of the Modern South, 1900-1930\".\nBefore the Civil War, Citizens' Bank of New Orleans issued the notes, which became known as \"Dixies.\"\nSome historians believed the term was adopted to describe Louisiana and then later became the geographical nickname for the South.\n\"We don't actually quite know when the term started or where it was derived from. But by the mid-19th century it was a minstrel song,\" Ingram said. \"By that point it was clearly in popular culture associated with the South and recognized as a racialized term.\"\nIngram is referring to \"Dixie,\" a minstrel song composed by Daniel Decatur Emmett in 1859. The tune became the Confederate Army's most popular marching song and the unofficial national anthem of the Confederacy, according to Ingram.\nMinstrel shows of the mid-19th century featured White performers in blackface putting on tattered clothing and exaggerating their features to look stereotypically Black. The performances were intended to be funny to Whites, but they were demeaning and hurtful to the Black community.\nDifferent theories, but one conclusion\nThe word Dixie takes on a different meaning for different people.\nMost commonly, it's associated with the old South and Confederate states. Dixie was considered the land south of the Mason-Dixon line, where slavery was legal.\nBut once the term was used in a minstrel song, its correlation with racist ideologies became crystal clear, according to Ingram.\n\"Most historians would agree that Dixie is a word people understand as obviously a reference not just to a place, but a certain kind of ideology,\" said Ingram, a history professor at College of Charleston in South Carolina.\n\"There's no mystery around all this,\"she said. \"People's instincts about this being a problematic term is definitely correct. It's correlated with something a lot darker than just history.\"\nShe added: \"By the time Dixie made it into minstrel shows, it was clearly understood to be more than just a place name. 'Dixie' was the antebellum South, and the lyrics evoke a very nostalgic and romanticized view of slavery.\"\nLady Antebellum is changing its name to Lady A\nGeorge Floyd's death has reignited protests and a national conversation about race, police brutality and social injustice.\nAlong with calls to defund the police, and protesters tearing down statues of men who once championed or traded in slavery, music bands and companies are rebranding and dropping racial terms from their names.\n\"When the Dixie Chicks decided to name their band the Dixie Chicks, I don't think they were trying to come up with an offensive name. A lot of people use the term without understanding the racialized origins of the term,\" Ingram said.\n\"It makes perfect sense that now against the backdrop of Black Lives Matter protests and the toppling of memorials and statues that people are being reminded of the troubling history of the term and that it's something we just can't be using casually anymore,\" she said."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/12/us/john-wayne-exhibit-usc-trnd/index.html", "headline": "USC will remove a John Wayne exhibit after actor's racist comments resurfaced", "published_date": "2020-07-12", "text": "(CNN)The University of Southern California's School of Cinematic Arts will remove an exhibit dedicated to John Wayne as the late actor's past bigoted remarks have come under increased scrutiny.\n\"Conversations about systemic racism in our cultural institutions along with the recent global, civil uprising by the Black Lives Matter Movement require that we consider the role our School can play as a change maker in promoting antiracist cultural values and experiences,\" Assistant Dean of Diversity and Inclusion Evan Hughes said in a Friday announcement to the film school community.\nDemocrats want John Wayne Airport renamed after 'I believe in white supremacy' interview resurfaces\n\"Therefore, it has been decided that the Wayne Exhibit will be removed.\"\nThe exhibit will instead be moved to the Cinematic Arts Library, Hughes wrote, where it can be placed \"within the proper archival and research context\" for continued education on Wayne's role in film history.\nWhile the statement did not directly address the controversy surrounding Wayne, his legacy has recently been re-examined, especially after a 1971 interview with Playboy resurfaced and went viral last year.

It's up to the county's Board of Supervisors to make a final decision.\n\"While some outside Orange County may not know of John Wayne's beliefs in white supremacy, many Orange County residents have been calling for his removal for years,\" Orange County Democratic Party Chairwoman Ada Brice\u00f1o said in a statement. \"We're seeing renewed calls for this right now, and it's time for change.\"\nIn an interview last year, Wayne's son, Ethan Wayne, said his father \"took everyone at face value\" and that his words in the Playboy interview were taken out of context.\n\"So any discussion of removing his name from the airport should include the full picture of the life of John Wayne and not be based on a single outlier interview from half a century ago,\" Ethan Wayne said.\nCNN's Deanna Hackney, Eliott C.

The movement supports shifting the responsibility to uphold societal order to communities and investing money in them, too. It's a model of policing, some activists point out, many affluent white Americans already experience.\nThe hope is that stronger infrastructure -- and the absence of traditional law enforcement that many in the movement believe unfairly targets black Americans -- will reduce crime and deaths at the hands of police.\nThe movement to pare back the role of police isn't a monolith, though.\nThere are abolitionists who advocate for dissolving existing police departments and removing police from society, like organizers with the Minneapolis police abolitionist group MPD150.\nThere are defunders, who want to shrink police departments and their budgets and reinvest those resources in communities without getting rid of police entirely. Los Angeles Police Commission President Eileen Decker already made a small concession by pledging that between $100 million to $150 million cut from the LAPD budget would be \"identified to further enhance community neighborhood policing efforts.\"\nThere's no precedent for a police-free US, or at least a US where the role of police is limited.\nAnd there are those who sit somewhere in between. They want to radically reimagine public safety without police, but they acknowledge that defunding is often the first step toward the dissolution of law enforcement as we know it.\nSupporters in all three camps support shifting traditional criminal justice away from punishment and imprisonment to one of reform and rehabilitation.\nBut there's no precedent for a police-free US, or at least a US where the role of police is limited.\nTo crystallize the concept, CNN posed three scenarios to experts and activists in the movement and asked how they'd be handled in an America without police.\nPatrisse Cullors, co-founder of Black Lives Matter\nPhilip McHarris, a doctoral candidate in sociology and African American Studies at Yale University and lead research and policy associate at the Community Resource Hub for Safety and Accountability\nAlex Vitale, a professor of Sociology and Coordinator of the Policing and Social Justice Project at Brooklyn College and author of \"The End of Policing\"\nThe organizers with MPD150 are staunch abolitionists. Cullors and McHarris believe in the abolition of police, too, but they also acknowledge that defunding is the first, crucial step. And Vitale supports strictly limiting the role of police so they're needed only to respond to dangerous threats.\nA traffic stop\nHere's what a traffic stop without police would look like 01:16\nMost Americans' contact with police comes during a traffic stop, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. But as recent data proves, routine traffic stops can turn antagonistic for black drivers.\nPolice pull over black drivers 20% more often than white drivers, according to the Stanford Open Policing Project, which analyzed nearly 100 million traffic stops between the years of 2001 and 2017. The data also shows that black and Hispanic drivers were searched about twice as often as white drivers on average. Searches of black and Hispanic drivers were often based on less evidence.\nAnd a 2018 Bureau of Justice Statistics report, which cited data from 2015, found that when police initiated contact, they were more likely to threaten or use physical force against blacks and Hispanics than whites.\nClick here to see an extended interview about this scenario.\nA domestic violence call\nDe-escalation would be the key to domestic violence calls 01:39\nAbout 1.3 million domestic violence incidents happened between 2006 and 2015, a Bureau of Justice Statistics report found. Although 56% of those incidents were reported to police, the offender was only arrested or charged 39% of the time.\nThe offender was arrested or charges were filed during the initial police response in just 23% of those reported incidents, the report found.\nMany domestic violence victims feel uncomfortable contacting the police for help. A 2015 National Domestic Violence Hotline survey of more than 600 women who had experienced partner abuse found that more than half of respondents said that calling the police would \"make things worse.\"\nAbout 80% of participants who hadn't previously called police were \"somewhat or extremely afraid\" to call in the future, 70% were afraid that calling would make things worse and 59% were afraid that police wouldn't believe them.\nThe survey responses don't reflect the efficacy of law enforcement's response to domestic violence, but they do suggest that victims lack trust in police to effectively handle their cases.\nClick here to see an extended interview about this scenario.\nA school shooting\nCould school shootings really be handled without police? 01:29\nSchool shootings are a terrible feature of American life, and the US hasn't been able to stop them. Over the last two decades, lawmakers have paid to bolster police presence in schools, a largely unstudied solution, to prevent gun violence. But the problem of school shootings remains, even with more school resource officers on US campuses.\nInitiatives that have involved police, like hiring school resource officers and installing metal detectors haven't been shown to decrease the likelihood of school shootings, and many of those measures were installed without evidence to support their efficacy, according to a 2017 review of studies on safety measures enacted over the last two decades.\nAfter the Columbine High School shooting in 1999, Congress allocated more than $800 million between 1999 and 2005 to support the hiring of over 7,000 school resource officers.\nAnd after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012, the Justice Department's Office of Community Oriented Policing Services dispersed $125 million among more than 260 cities and counties to create new law enforcement positions to protect schools.\nClick here to see an extended interview about this scenario."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/19/us/chicago-shootings-weekend/index.html", "headline": "Chicago shootings leave at least 49 people shot and seven dead this weekend", "published_date": "2020-07-19", "text": "(CNN)At least 49 people have been shot, including seven fatally, in incidents across Chicago this weekend, police said, continuing a trend of increased shootings and murders in the city.\nSeven teenagers, all boys, were among those wounded in multiple shootings reported since Friday evening, police said.\nOne victim, a 24-year-old woman, was standing on the sidewalk in a residential area \"when she heard shots (and) felt pain,\" police said in a statement. She went to Holy Cross Hospital with a gunshot wound to the left thigh and a gunshot wound to the buttocks. She is in fair condition, police said.\nHours earlier, a 35-year-old man was shot in the neck and died of his injuries at Northwestern Hospital. The man and a 25-year-old woman waved down police from a car after both had been shot around 2:35 a.m. Sunday, police said in a statement. The woman is in good condition but uncooperative with police, police said.\nThe violence fits a trend seen across major US cities this year: a sharp rise in shootings and murders in the past few months, even as overall crime complaints have declined. These trends coincide with the end of pandemic-related shutdowns and the mass protests against police violence and racism.\nHomicides are surging in US cities. Some say defunding the police will actually make it fall\nAs of July 12, Chicago police reported 385 murders this year, a 48% increase from at the same point in 2019, and 1,541 shootings, a 46% increase from the same point last year.\nThe increase has been particularly stark in the past month. There were 116 reported murders in the 28 days before July 12, about three times the murders in the same period in 2019.\nTotal crime complaints are down 9% compared to last year, led by steep declines in theft and criminal sexual assault incidents, according to Chicago police.\nCompared to 2016, crime complaints have declined 23%, with 10% more murders so far this year but 11% fewer shooting incidents. Historically, this year's murders and shootings are well below the heights of the 1990s, when crime peaked in US cities.\nCrime experts believe this year's increase in murders and shootings relates to the heightened distrust between police and the communities they serve, exemplified by Black Lives Matter protests across the country.\nRichard Rosenfeld, a criminologist at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, said it's highly likely that widespread social unrest in response to George Floyd's death and other police violence is contributing to an increase in violent crime. When people don't trust the police, he said, they're more likely to take matters in their own hands."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/23/us/atlanta-spotlight-brooks-funeral/index.html", "headline": "Atlanta is once again at the center of the nation's struggle with race and civil rights", "published_date": "2020-06-23", "text": "Atlanta (CNN)The home of Martin Luther King Jr., capital of the New South and \"the city too busy to hate\" is again in the spotlight of protest and change related to the country's race relations, from Black Lives Matter to the presidential election.\nRecent violence will lead to grieving in a historic location Tuesday in Atlanta.

America is going to change.\"\nBakeer said this 28 years ago. I was standing amid the smoldering ashes of Los Angeles' South Central neighborhood in 1992, when I was a rookie newspaper reporter assigned to cover the Rodney King riots.\nThe viral video that set a city on fire 03:00\nBut the news cycle moved on, and the accounts and videos of black men brutalized by police kept coming. After all the deaths and the protests -- in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014 and in Baltimore in 2015, to name a few -- came the same calls for change and the same rhetoric: This time will be different.\nI've seen how this movie ends. I also covered the Freddie Gray riots, which erupted in the same West Baltimore neighborhood where I grew up. I've seen the same pattern: Exuberant protesters, vows for police reform, and then ... nothing.\nBut after the George Floyd demonstrations I find myself filled with a guarded optimism, even as I wrestle with the fear that nothing will stop these ghoulish videos.\nI see three big reasons why things really do feel different this time.\nWhite people get it now\nMy optimism starts with a painful memory. It was the most heartbreaking confession I've ever heard from a young black man.\nI was interviewing a black family in a gang-dominated neighborhood in Los Angeles not long before the King riots. They lived like moles. Everything in their house -- their furniture, their mattresses -- was as close to the floor as possible. A rival gang had shot into the house so much that they low-walked through the rooms. Bullet holes dotted the walls.\nA member of the family, 17 at the time, said many of his friends had already been killed. He couldn't envision reaching middle age.\n\"All I know is I want to make a baby before I die,\" he told me.\nBusinesses beginning to burn on Pico Boulevard during the Rodney King riots on April 30, 1992 in Los Angeles.\nBefore Black Lives Matter was a hashtag, it was a question mark. I met so many black and brown people in South Central who wondered if white people cared about how much they suffered. They lived in a perpetual crossfire -- terrified of gangs and the Los Angeles Police Department.\nCovering gangs like the Crips and the Bloods was my first journalism job out of college. It may sound exciting, but I was miserable, and sometimes terrified. What I remember most was the isolation of those communities. People felt like they were marooned in impoverished, dangerous neighborhoods by whites who couldn't give a damn about how many of them were murdered.\nRead more from John Blake:\nVoter suppression now has a white face in Wisconsin\nCoronavirus is bringing a plague of dangerous doomsday predictions\nBlack America is being hammered by a double pandemic\nNative Americans were already decimated by a virus. They're scared it could happen again\nHer father was called 'the most dangerous racist in America.' She wants a different legacy for her son\nTrump is doing what Obama couldn't\nBut the Floyd protests have introduced a plot twist that I didn't see coming.\nI've never had so many black friends and relatives call me, all saying the same thing: Did you see all of them white people out there?\nThose who focus on the surprising number of white people at these protests, though, miss an important point: It's not just the number of white people who are putting their bodies on the line, it's the type of white people who are showing solidarity.\nDemonstrators stage a sit-in on Tuesday, June 9, on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles during a protest over the death of George Floyd.\nWe're not just seeing Berkeley radicals at these rallies. Protests have spread to small, predominately white towns -- even places like Vidor, Texas, a former Ku Klux Klan stronghold that Texas Monthly once called the \"most hate-filled town\" in the state. More than 70% of Americans see Floyd's death as part of a larger racial problem, according to an ABC News/Ipsos poll.\nI've never seen so many white people as angry about racism as its victims.\nThis was unthinkable during the King riots.\nMany of the people I talked to in South Central perceived that much of white America saw them as animals. They thought whites were titillated by tales of gang violence and tough LAPD cops. One of my friends called it \"gangster chic.\" But most whites didn't seem interested in learning about the type of racism that made some black people's lives so miserable.\nThey are now. When President George W. Bush releases a statement asking, \"How do we end systemic racism in our society?\" something has changed.\nMore white people are saying what Andy Stanley, a prominent white evangelical pastor, said during a recent sermon on the Floyd protests: It's no longer enough to be a non-racist; one must be an anti-racist.\nDemonstrators gather in St. Paul, Minnesota on June 5, 2020, to protest he death of George Floyd.\nThe Floyd video was an Emmett Till moment for white America, one professor told me.\n\"Perhaps the tipping point of violence against black citizens has finally broken though the apathy of the dominant majority, such as Emmett Till's open casket and the images of his brutalized face (that) finally snapped many Americans out of a delusional belief that America was great for all,\" says Susan Peppers-Bates, a philosophy professor and director of the Africana Studies minor at Stetson University in Florida.\nOne of my friends put it best when he called me one recent night after watching white demonstrators square off against police in riot gear. He declared:\n\"White people get it now.\"\nThe Floyd protesters have the perfect villain\nMy optimism is also based on another encounter with a young black man. This one took place five years ago in Baltimore.\nThe experience literally hit home for me.\nI'd been sent to the city to cover the unrest over Gray, a black man who died while in police custody. The epicenter of the riots was in the same neighborhood where I grew up. National Guardsmen with assault rifles patrolled outside the house where I played with friends.\nI spotted a teenager in braids leaning against a sign at a nearby bus stop. He scowled as I approached. Everyone seemed angry that day.\nPeople walk past burning cars near the intersection of Pennsylvania Avenue and North Avenue in Baltimore on April 27, 2015. Riots erupted in the city following the funeral service for Freddie Gray, who died while in Baltimore Police custody.\nHis name was Malik, and he told me he was angry at Baltimore's mayor for calling young protesters \"thugs.\" He didn't think any of the city's political or law enforcement leaders cared about young black men like himself.\n\"They talk about 'We the future,' but they killing us,\" Malik, then 15, told me.\nThis wasn't a South Central rerun. Malik was angry at black people, not white people. The city leaders he castigated were all black.\nEvery protest movement needs a focal point for its wrath. The civil rights movement had a racist antagonist, Alabama lawman \"Bull\" Connor. The #MeToo movement has movie mogul Harvey Weinstein. But the Freddie Gray protests didn't really have that, and I think it hurt them.\nI detected a palpable letdown in my old Baltimore neighborhood when people finally saw the pictures of the six police officers arrested in connection with Gray's death. Half of them were black. The city's police chief and mayor were black. How could protesters claim that Gray was a victim of racist cops and politicians when Baltimore was controlled by black leaders?\nPolice officers from previous protests faded from public view like phantoms. Many have forgotten their names.\nThe Floyd protesters, though, may have the perfect villain in President Trump.\nIntentionally or not, he has mobilized protesters.\nPresident Donald Trump walks past police in Lafayette Park after he visited St. John's Church across from the White House on Monday, June 1, 2020.\nMany were outraged by his tweet saying, \"when the looting starts, the shooting starts.\" The use of smoke canisters and pepper balls to remove protesters so Trump could hold up a Bible in front of a church backfired by turning out more protesters, Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said.\n\"You have a leader who is thoroughly incompetent and inept in this moment,\" Bryan Adamson, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio, told me. \"He has managed to fan the flames of racism.\"\nPolice culture won't be the same\nAnother memory from 1992 Los Angeles suggests to me that this time may be different.\nIt's when I met one of the most notorious police chiefs in America. His name was Daryl Gates, and he was chief of the Los Angeles Police Department during the Rodney King riots. A veteran of the US Navy, Gates helped spread the militarization of police departments around the nation.\nGates once told a US Senate committee that casual drug users \"ought to be taken out and shot.\" He said that more blacks died from police chokeholds because their arteries were not the same as \"normal people,\" a remark for which he later apologized. Under Gates' command, the LAPD used an armored personnel carrier to bash in suspected drug houses.\nDemonstrators protest outside Los Angeles Police Department Headquarters after the verdict in the Rodney King case.\nGates was forced to resign from the LAPD in 1992. But until now I have never seen so many police officers break publicly with the military culture that's embedded in so many departments.\nPolice officers have knelt with and marched with protesters. Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo asked his department to provide escort services for Floyd's body upon his return to the city for his burial.\nThe days of big-city police chiefs acting like Gen. George Patton may be over. The potential legal and political costs are too high.\nBesides, there's something about the Floyd video that hits at law enforcement in a way that other videos didn't, says Adamson, the Case Western professor.\n\"I think many officers, especially black and brown, had to be wrecked by what they saw,\" Adamson says.\nPolice officers kneel during a rally in Coral Gables, Florida, on May 30, 2020 in response to the death of George Floyd.\nThe Floyd video could lead to concrete changes in police culture. Already, all four Minneapolis officers who were filmed arresting Floyd have been arrested and charged in his death. Other police departments have also taken swift recent action against officers accused of misconduct.\nPoliticians are getting involved. The Minneapolis City Council has pledged to defund and dismantle the city's police department in the wake of Floyd's death. Such steps could include everything from dismantling the structure of the city's police force to dramatically reducing its budget.\nCongressional Democrats released a package of proposed police reforms, and some local governments are banning chokeholds. Republicans, and the White House, are discussing reforms as well.\nSimilar reforms have been tried before, including after the Rodney King, Ferguson and Freddie Gray protests. But the movement has more momentum now.\nAnd what if it's still not enough?\nIf protesters ultimately help make policy, and not just noise, my optimism may be validated.\nThe US Congressman and civil rights icon John Lewis recently said something that's crucial: \"The vote is the most powerful nonviolent tool we have in a democratic society.\"\nA Trump victory in November, though, could derail any momentum generated by the protests, says Christopher Huff, a history professor at Beacon College in Florida who studies protest movements.\n\"It would be devastating,\" Huff says. \"If what's happening now translates into an electoral defeat in November, that would be an indicator that what's been going on may have lacked a grounding to effect long-term change.\"\nDemonstrators denouncing systemic racism and the police killings of black Americans rally in Washington Square Park on June 6, 2020, in New York City.\nI'm familiar with this kind of disappointment. I've seen the hope for police reform rise and fall. I try not to return to the level of pessimism that I once felt while listening to the young man who only wanted to make a baby before he was murdered.\nBut now I have a new fear. What if this time really is different, but that's still not enough to affect meaningful change?\nWhat if I keep seeing a succession of unarmed black and brown people struck down on videos? What if one day it's someone I know -- or me?\nAnd yet in other moments, I also believe that true change is possible. The price of police brutality is becoming too high to pay. There is a new generation of black, brown and white anti-racists who will change America.\nIn truth, I bounce between hope and skepticism: This time won't be different. This time will be different.\nIt may not make sense to believe both. But it's better than what I once felt: no hope at all."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/12/us/videos-jail-custody-death-sterling-higgins-invs/index.html", "headline": "Videos raise question about in-custody death deemed an 'accident' by Tennessee officials", "published_date": "2020-06-13", "text": "(CNN)Within hours of his call to 911 outside a convenience store, Sterling Higgins lay dead, after video shows him being forcibly restrained on the floor at the Obion County Jail in Union City, Tennessee.\nA surveillance camera video from that morning, 15 months ago, shows a correctional officer gripping Higgins' neck and head for nearly six minutes, and part of that time his arresting officer with one foot on him.

All the officers claimed qualified immunity, a doctrine that holds officers immune from personal liability for acts done in their official capacity unless they violated a clearly established law or constitutional right. The city and county also denied wrongdoing.\nAccording to Union City police records, Higgins, 37, called 911 from the parking lot of Pocket's Market, a convenience store. He told police that someone was following him, trying to kill him and steal his money. According to the complaint, one of the officers \"suggested to Mr. Higgins that he probably needed to go to a hospital,\" based on how he was behaving. Attorneys for the defendants denied this allegation. He agreed to leave.\nOfficers place Sterling Higgins into a restraint chair in the Obion County Jail in Union City, Tennessee.\nBut officers soon returned, after another 911 call, to find him hiding inside a cooler at the back of the convenience store. They arrested Higgins for trespass.\nBased on his erratic behavior, the complaint alleges, police should have realized Higgins was suffering from a medical or mental-health crisis and taken him to a hospital or mental health facility. According to records, Higgins' estranged wife told investigators that \"he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia but refused to take the medication prescribed to him.\" Budge said he couldn't comment on Higgins' mental health because he hasn't yet seen the underlying medical records.\nUnion City Police Chief Perry Barfield said his department's policy is that \"if someone has a medical condition that warrants going to hospital, then they would transport them there first, but there's nothing in place regarding mental-health issues.\"\nInstead, officers took him to the Obion County Jail. Surveillance video at the jail shows Higgins, handcuffed, running around the police car. Taken inside, he briefly grabbed the hair of a female corrections officer, before being taken to the floor by Orsborne, then held on the floor by officer Waylon Spaulding.\nIn a handwritten statement, Spaulding said Higgins tried to spit at him, so \"I ... put my hand under inmate Higgins' chin in an attempt to keep him from spitting on any other officers.\"\nAs Spaulding gripped Higgins' throat and face, two other jailers put shackles on his feet and legs. While the video is unclear, the arresting police officer, Orsborne, told investigators he put a foot on Higgins' leg, then stood on the leg shackles' chains to help restrain him.\nSterling Higgins with his daughter\nThe video shows Spaulding holding the grip on Higgins' neck, and Orsborne standing over him, for several minutes. Higgins' body goes limp, but Spaulding maintains the pressure for another two minutes, according to the lawsuit. By the time he removes his hands, it has been nearly six minutes in total.\nAt about 1:55 a.m., the jailers drag Higgins' limp form to a restraint chair, the video shows. They wheel him into holding cell 15. A few minutes later, they check him. Spaulding, in his handwritten statement, said Higgins wasn't breathing, so they called emergency medical services. EMS records show they received a call at 2:06 a.m.\nAt 2:15 a.m., an EMS team arrived. Higgins had no pulse and wasn't breathing, according to the EMS report, which described his \"primary symptom\" as \"obvious death.\" The team performed CPR. He was declared dead at a local hospital at 2:52 a.m.\nIn his autopsy report, pathologist Marco Ross noted a small hemorrhage on a muscle on the left side of Higgins' neck. \"He stated the finding did not mean that Higgins was choked or strangled. The injury is common and not fatal,\" said an investigator's report. Ross concluded Higgins' \"death was caused by excited delirium due to methamphetamine toxicity,\" and termed it \"an accident.\"\nBudge said an independent medical examiner is reviewing the findings, as part of the suit, \"and the full facts will come out.\"\nHiggins' post-mortem showed 620 nanograms per milliliter of methamphetamine in his blood. A footnote in the autopsy report stated that \"blood levels of 200-600 ng/mL have been reported in methamphetamine abusers who exhibited violent and irrational behavior.\"\nTommy Thomas, the district attorney general, told CNN that as soon as he found out about the death, he called the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation to do an independent investigation. But based on the autopsy findings \"and other investigative work done by the TBI, it was my determination that there was no criminal liability here,\" he said.\nThomas also said he told Higgins' family \"that there is a much lower standard in a civil responsibility case. Then I recommended that they seek counsel and perhaps proceed with a civil lawsuit. And that's what the family has done.\"\nSterling Higgins with his daughter and her mother, Jennifer Jenkins, the administrator of Higgins' estate.\nThomas added that he refers all deaths in custody to a grand jury, as he did this one, as a matter of policy. But, \"in this case, I did not believe beyond a reasonable doubt that any of those officers were guilty of a crime.\" Typically, grand juries issue indictments when there is probable cause to believe a crime was committed; the reasonable doubt standard is used by trial juries deciding whether to convict.\nTo Budge, the key issue is that Higgins didn't need to die.\n\"I think that there are multiple points in time where Mr. Higgins' life could have been saved,\" he said.\nHe questioned why Higgins needed to be arrested in the first place, rather than being referred for medical or mental-health care. He questioned why, once Higgins arrived at the jail, Spaulding apparently maintained pressure on Higgins' neck for so long.\nThe jail's use-of-force policy states that \"the amount of force applied shall only be as much as is reasonable and necessary to control a given situation.\"\n\"Officers have a way to deal with people who are alleged to be spitting. There was a spit mask available to the officers. Apparently, they never applied it,\" Budge said. \"And it certainly doesn't explain why an officer would keep his hands around somebody's neck or throat area for fully two additional minutes from the point that the person stops moving.\"\nThen, too, he said, \"the fact that medical was not called immediately after he became limp and nonresponsive raises great questions.\"\nThere are also questions about the conclusion that Higgins died from \"excited delirium.\"\nAccording to the National Institutes of Health, excited delirium \"is not a currently recognized medical or psychiatric diagnosis,\" in either the diagnostic manual of the American Psychiatric Association or the international classification of diseases of the World Health Organization.\nOne medical examiner, who spoke on condition of not being named because he wasn't involved in the Higgins case, said that coroners sometimes the term \"excited delirium\" when there were multiple factors and they're not really sure just what caused the death. He said, \"a lot of people don't use that term anymore,\" and that often, it's more useful simply to list all the contributing factors individually.\nBudge also questioned the finding of \"excited delirium.\"\n\"Ultimately, the end goal is to get to the truth and get justice for Sterling Higgins,\" he said, and \"that change is made so that people's lives are protected because nobody, nobody should be in the position of dying in jail when that death is preventable.\"\nIn a statement, Jennifer Jenkins, administrator of Higgins' estate, said, \"Sterling Higgins was a good man who deserved fair and humane treatment. He left behind two young children, who will now grow up without a father. He was treated as if his life doesn't matter. We want the truth to be known. We want accountability. We want justice or Sterling Higgins.\"\nCNN's Curt Devine, Yahya Abou-Ghazala and Collette Richards contributed to this report"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/17/us/allentown-police-knee-neck-no-charges/index.html", "headline": "Allentown police officer seen kneeling on man's neck won't face charges, prosecutors say", "published_date": "2020-07-18", "text": "(CNN)The two Allentown, Pennsylvania, police officers who appear on a video showing one of them kneeling on a man's neck outside a hospital won't face any charges, prosecutors say.\n\"I have concluded that there is absolutely no evidence to support filing criminal charges against either of the Allentown police officers involved in this incident,\" Lehigh County District Attorney James Martin said in statement Friday.\nPolice had launched an investigation earlier this week after a video of the July 11 incident posted on social media appeared to show an officer kneeling on a man's neck while a second officer and another person hold the man's hands behind his back.\nThe district attorney also looked at a nine-minute, 39-second video shot from a camera across the street from where the incident happened, the statement said.\nAllentown Police investigating after video appears to show officer putting his knee on man's neck\nOfficers were at the emergency room of a hospital when they saw a man vomiting and staggering in the street before stopping in the driveway of the emergency room, police had said.\nThe man began pointing aggressively toward a hospital security officer who was walking toward him with a vomit bag, the district attorney said on Friday.\nThe officers concluded that the man's \"actions were aggressive, and they determined that they needed to detain him for his own safety as well as for the safety of themselves and others, including medical personnel,\" the district attorney said.\nWhen they attempted to detain him and take him inside the hospital, the prosecutor said, the man resisted and began pulling away.\n\"In attempting to handcuff [the man], one of the officers placed his knee on [his head] (not on his neck).

Here's what it means", "published_date": "2020-06-07", "text": "(CNN)There's a growing group of dissenters who believe Americans can survive without law enforcement as we know it. And Americans, those dissenters believe, may even be better off without it.\nThe solution to police brutality and racial inequalities in policing is simple, supporters say: Just defund police.\nIt's as straightforward as it sounds: Instead of funding a police department, a sizable chunk of a city's budget is invested in communities, especially marginalized ones where much of the policing occurs.\nThe concept's been a murmur for years, particularly following the protests against police brutality in Ferguson, Missouri, though it seemed improbable in 2014.\nBut it's becoming a shout. With the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor at the hands of police and nationwide protests demanding reform, Minneapolis officials announced their intent to defund and disband the city's police force altogether.\nDoes defunding the police mean disbanding the police?\nThat depends on whom you ask, said Philip McHarris, a doctoral candidate in sociology at Yale University and lead research and policy associate at the Community Resource Hub for Safety and Accountability.\nSome supporters of divestment want to reallocate some, but not all, funds away from police departments to social services and reduce their contact with the public to reduce the likelihood of police violence.\nThose seeking to disband police consider defunding an initial step toward creating an entirely different model of community-led public safety.\nThe concept exists on a spectrum, and the two aren't dichotomous but interconnected. But both interpretations center on reimagining what public safety looks like -- shifting resources away from law enforcement toward community resources, he said.\nIt also means dismantling the idea that police are \"public stewards\" meant to protect communities. Many Black Americans and other people of color don't feel protected by police, McHarris said.\nProtestors are tear gassed as police disperse them near the White House.\nWhy defund police?\nMcHarris says divesting funds can begin the process of ending the culture of punishment in the criminal justice system. And it's one of the only options local governments haven't tried in their attempts to end deaths in police custody.\nTrainings and body cameras haven't brought about the change supporters want.\nMcHarris grew up in a neighborhood where there were \"real, discernible threats of gun violence,\" and he said he never thought to call the police -- that was for his own safety. Instead, he relied on neighbors who helped him navigate threats of danger.\nWhat if, he said, those people could provide the same support they showed him on a full-time basis?\nTo explain why he supports the idea, Isaac Bryan, the director of UCLA's Black Policy Center, points to history: Law enforcement in the South began as slave patrol, a team of vigilantes hired to recapture escaped slaves. Then, when slavery was abolished, police enforced Jim Crow laws -- even the most minor infractions.\nAnd today, police disproportionately use force against black people, and black people are more likely to be arrested and sentenced.\n\"That history is engrained in our law enforcement,\" Bryan said.\nPolice arrest a protester on Fifth Avenue during a march in Manhattan.\nWhere would those funds go?\nPatrisse Cullors, co-founder of the Black Lives Matter movement, said defunding the police means reallocating those funds to support people and services in marginalized communities.\nDefunding law enforcement \"means that we are reducing the ability for law enforcement to have resources that harm our communities,\" Cullors said in an interview with WBUR, Boston's public radio station. \"It's about reinvesting those dollars into black communities, communities that have been deeply divested from.\"\nThose dollars can be put back into social services for mental health, domestic violence and homelessness, among others. Police are often the first responders to all three, she said.\nThose dollars can be used to fund schools, hospitals, housing and food in those communities, too -- \"all of the things we know increase safety,\" McHarris said.\nNew York Police Department officers stand in formation after arresting multiple protesters marching after curfew on Fifth Avenue in New York.\nWhy disband police?\nDisbanding police altogether falls on the more radical end of the police divestment spectrum, but it's gaining traction.\nMPD150, a community advocacy organization in Minneapolis, focuses on abolishing local police. Its work has been spotlighted since the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis Police custody.\n\"The people who respond to crises in our community should be the people who are best-equipped to deal with those crises,\" the organization says.\nRather than \"strangers armed with guns,\" the organization says, first responders should be mental health providers, social workers, victim advocates and other community members in less visible roles.\nIt argues law and order isn't abetted by law enforcement, but through education, jobs and mental health services that low-income communities are often denied. MPD150 and other police abolition organizations want wider access to all three.\nProtesters take a knee in front of New York City police officers.\nWould defunding police lead to an uptick in violent crimes?\nDefunding police on a large scale hasn't been done before, so it's tough to say.\nBut there's evidence that less policing can lead to less crime. A 2017 report, which focused on several weeks in 2014 through 2015 when the New York Police Department purposely pulled back on \"proactive policing,\" found that there were 2,100 fewer crime complaints during that time.\nThe study defines proactive policing as the \"systematic and aggressive enforcement of low-level violations\" and heightened police presence in areas where \"crime is anticipated.\"\nThat's exactly the kind of activity that police divestment supporters want to end.\nMinneapolis Police and Minnesota State Patrol form a police line.\nWill defunding the police come to pass?\nIt's radical for an American city to operate without law enforcement, but the plan is already in motion in Minneapolis.\nOn Sunday, nine members of the Minneapolis city council announced they intend to disband the city's police force entirely.\n\"We committed to dismantling policing as we know it in the city of Minneapolis and to rebuild with our community a new model of public safety that actually keeps our community safe,\" Council President Lisa Bender told CNN.\nBender said the council still needs to discuss what to replace police with, but that the city would funnel money from police into \"community-based strategies.\" She noted, too, that most 911 calls are for mental health services, health and EMT and fire services.\nDefunding is simpler than disbanding, though, and at least one mayor's already taken that step. After Californians decried a proposal to increase the Los Angeles Police Department budget to $1.86 billion, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti agreed to slash between $100 million to $150 million from the proposed funding.\nIt's not a significant dent in the budget, but it's proof that officials are listening, Bryan said.\n\"A week ago, defunding the police in any capacity would sound like 'pie in the sky,'\" he said. \"Now we're talking about it. Defunding police in its entirety still might sound like 'pie in the sky,' but next week might be different.\""}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/14/us/police-violence-defund-debate-trnd/index.html", "headline": "Crime is surging in US cities.

Violent crime is surging.\nShootings and homicides, which dipped during the initial lockdown phase of the pandemic, are now rising at alarmingly high rates.\nIn New York, the homicide rate for the first half of the year is up 23% over 2019, led by a huge spike in recent violence. In Chicago, homicides jumped 39% during the last week of June and the first week of July compared to the same period last year. And Los Angeles has seen double-digit rises in homicides the past two months.\nIn Atlanta, New Orleans, Washington and other cities, the shooting victims have included children. On Sunday in Brooklyn, a 1-year-old boy was killed by gunfire in his stroller while picnicking with his family.\nAt least 6 kids killed by gun violence over holiday weekend 03:07\nOpponents of the recent movement to defund police, including President Trump, blame Black Lives Matter protesters and civil unrest for this rise in crime. And they say that what's happening now is a prime example of why cities should not cut police departments' funding. As they see it, this crime surge calls for more police and bigger law enforcement budgets.\nBut supporters of defunding police -- reducing police budgets and redirecting the money to communities in other ways, such as social services -- argue this moment is proof that the US doesn't need more police. They say if cities focused on the root causes of crime, like poverty, substance abuse and disparities in criminal justice, there wouldn't be as much need for police.\nIt's too soon to know for sure why rates of violent crime are spiking, criminologists say. But to make cities safer and earn back the public's trust, they agree that officials will need to retool police in some capacity -- and not by adding more officers.\nWhy crime is rising\nCrime is a symptom of summertime. The combination of heat, no school, outdoor hangouts and interpersonal conflict mean cities often see their highest rates of crime in the warmest months.\nBut this summer is a different beast.\nRichard Rosenfeld, a criminologist who teaches at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, said it's \"reasonably clear\" that crime is climbing at least partially due to cities reopening and activities resuming.\nRosenfeld recently published research that found the homicide rate in large US cities plunged in March, April and May compared to the previous year. He said he's almost certain that coronavirus lockdowns caused homicides to fall.\nPolice work a crime scene in Brooklyn where a 1-year-old boy was killed July 13 when gunfire erupted at a family picnic.\nHis analysis of data for June isn't complete, but he said the uptick in crime is clear. He said it's highly likely that widespread social unrest in response to George Floyd's death and other police violence is contributing to an increase in violent crime.\nRosenfeld believes the protests have stoked existing tensions between police and the communities they serve. When people don't trust police or fear their response if they call for help, they won't contact them when crimes occur or cooperate with investigators.\nThe pandemic, which has disproportionately sickened and killed Black Americans, and the Black Lives Matter protests have hit a raw nerve among people of color, said Richard Aborn, president of the Citizens' Crime Commission of New York City. This has fueled distrust of institutions, including police, and led to a \"crisis of police legitimacy,\" he said.\nAnd when people don't trust the police, Rosenfeld said, they're more likely to take matters in their own hands and settle disputes on their own.\nDefunding police would boost crime rates, some say\nSome elected officials say that employing fewer police on the streets would only give criminals a leg up.\nUS Sen. Ted Cruz has repeatedly come out against cutting police budgets, a move he says would \"decimate\" vulnerable communities. Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana said defunding police \"would be great for robbers and rapists,\" a sentiment President Trump also tweeted.\nPeople protesting the death of George Floyd and police brutality on June 2 in New York City.\nPowerful police unions like the the New York Police Benevolent Association have deflected blame for rising crime and pointed fingers instead at city officials.\nIn a letter to Mayor Bill de Blasio and other New York leaders, PBA President Patrick Lynch said city officials \"created an atmosphere of hatred and disrespect toward police officers and criminals are taking full advantage.\"\nWhen the New York Attorney General issued guidelines for an overhaul of the NYPD, Lynch called them \"reheated proposals that have been part of the anti-police agenda for decades.\" He also criticized cuts to the NYPD's budget, and in a statement implied that fewer officers on streets would cause crime to spike.\nNYPD Chief of Department Terance Monahan recently said that \"anti-police rhetoric\" has \"basically destroyed morale\" among his officers.\n\"Our cops are unsure what to do,\" Monahan told the Police Executive Research Forum last month. \"They think there's no reason to do any quality-of-life enforcement.\"\nPolice take cover as a barrage of gunfire erupts during a demonstration to mark the one-year anniversary of the shooting of Michael Brown on August 9, 2015, in Ferguson, Missouri.\nThis issue has come up before. In 2014 and 2015, the country saw protests against police brutality and racism after the killings of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Freddie Gray in Baltimore. Some police chiefs argued that their officers didn't feel comfortable responding to calls out of fear of being vilified and that crime rose as a result -- a phenomenon they called the \"Ferguson effect.\"\nBut US crime rates during those years didn't fully support that theory. There were some indicators that police drawback in Chicago and Baltimore contributed to crime hikes. But one study examined crime rates in 81 US cities in the year after Brown's death and found no overall increase.\nOthers say a lighter approach to policing will actually make crime go down\nA revamped model of policing has already paid off in some cities now considered national models for reform.\nCamden, New Jersey, which was once considered one of the most dangerous cities in the US, overhauled its police department in 2012 to emphasize partnership and problem-solving over violence and punishment. Officers now host pop-up barbecues and pull up in ice cream trucks to get to know residents. The city's crime rate has dropped by close to half.\nStaunch defenders of traditional police tactics are missing an enormous opportunity to reimagine the way law enforcement works, some criminologists say. Reform is essential to regain the public's trust, they say, which is key to curbing crime.\nLorenzo Boyd, director of the University of New Haven's Center for Advanced Policing, was a police officer for over 15 years and has trained police for the last two decades. He said policing as it exists now is not sustainable, and those who defend it support a broken system.\nAn officer in Camden County, New Jersey, grills hot dogs for one of the department's pop-up neighborhood parties. The city has reformed its police department to focus on de-escalating violence in the community.\nBoyd said these people also subscribe to a belief that isn't logical: That more police leads to less crime.\nA 2019 joint investigation from USA Today and the Marshall Project found that the number of police officers doesn't correlate with a city's crime rate. Other studies have drawn similarly inconclusive results.\nThat's because the current system of policing in most cities is reactive, not proactive, Boyd said. Officers most often respond to crime after it happens.\n\"Police as currently instituted do not affect crime rates,\" he said. \"What they do affect are investigations and arrests after the crime.\"\nInstead of \"cracking down\" on crime, police would do better to address some of crime's root causes, Boyd said. Money could be reinvested from police budgets into social programs that would bolster the communities they police.\nFor decades Eugene, Oregon, has been dispatching mental health workers and medics to some 911 calls instead of police in a partnership with a local health services nonprofit. The move has saved the town millions and reduced the likelihood that some 911 calls turn violent.\nBoyd acknowledged this approach is more of a long-term solution than an immediate fix for the country's recent rise in crime -- but he believes it's a change this moment requires.\nWhat would the US look like without police? 02:17\n\"Crime is symptomatic of larger problems in society,\" he said. \"The reason we have crime is things like homelessness, transiency, levels of addiction, underemployment, undereducation, lack of food, lack of housing -- all of those things together make crime something that people will consider. Can we really expect police to address those issues?\"\nNeither Boyd nor Aborn, who leads the Citizens' Crime Commission, believe cities should defund the police entirely. Instead, they said departments should emphasize deescalation and empathy -- skills they can build by learning from the communities they serve.\nRosenfeld, the criminologist, disagrees with those who argue the country can't reform police and respond effectively to the surge in violence at the same time.\n\"We have to do both,\" he said.\nThe health and security of the nation -- this summer and beyond -- may depend on it."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/24/us/nba-breonna-taylor-spt-trnd/index.html", "headline": "NBA players are dedicating their post-game interviews to Breonna Taylor", "published_date": "2020-07-24", "text": "(CNN)With the NBA season officially resuming on July 30, players such as LeBron James are using their platforms to dedicate their post-game interviews to Breonna Taylor.\nJames talked to the media about Taylor on Thursday following the Los Angeles Lakers' scrimmage against the Dallas Mavericks and called for justice.\n\"I want to continue to shed light on justice for Breonna Taylor and to her family and everything that's going on with that situation,\" James said.\nA key miscalculation by officers contributed to the tragic death of Breonna Taylor\nWhen asked what the next step should be to get her justice, he replied, \"We want the cops arrested who committed that crime.\"\nTaylor, a 26-year-old EMT, was shot eight times and killed by Louisville Metro Police Department officers in a nighttime narcotics raid on March 13. A CNN review of the evidence showed a tragic flaw in the police operation which led to Taylor's death.

The league has specially designed uniforms that honor and demand justice for women who \"have been the forgotten victims of police brutality and racial violence,\" according to a news release by the league.\nWarm-up shirts worn by WNBA players will also have the words \"Black Lives Matter\" on the front and \"Say Her Name\" alongside Taylor's name on the back.\nThe WNBA season is set to kick off on July 25.\nCNN's David Close, Brian Ries, Scott Glover, Collette Richards, Curt Devine and Drew Griffin contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/25/us/five-things-june-25-trnd/index.html", "headline": "5 things to know for June 25: Coronavirus, Joe Biden, Ahmaud Arbery, Roundup, tariffs", "published_date": "2020-06-25", "text": "Get '5 Things' in your inbox\nIf your day doesn't start until you're up to speed on the latest headlines, then let us introduce you to your new favorite morning fix.

That expert prediction comes as the US records more than 2.3 million Covid-19 cases -- and as the three most populous US states set records for new cases daily. California reported more than 7,000 cases on Tuesday, obliterating a record hit a day earlier. Florida and Texas announced they had recorded more than 5,000 new Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, and one health expert fears major Texas cities could see \"apocalyptic\" numbers.

Joe Biden\nThe presidential election is still more than four months out, but polls out of Wisconsin and Ohio bring some good news for the Democratic nominee. A Marquette University poll from Wisconsin has former Vice President Joe Biden leading President Trump, 49% to 41%. In Ohio, where Trump beat Hillary Clinton by 8 points in 2016, a Quinnipiac University poll shows a tied race.

Bryan were indicted yesterday on malice and felony murder charges, a district attorney said. The charges also include aggravated assault, false imprisonment and criminal attempt to commit false imprisonment. Arbery was jogging in February outside Brunswick, Georgia, when the McMichaels chased him, authorities said. Investigators also said they believe Bryan, who made a video recording of the shooting, used his vehicle to try to \"confine and detain\" Arbery in the minutes leading to his death. Gregory McMichael's legal team said he was a victim of a rush to judgment, and Travis McMichael's lawyer said he is not guilty.

Bayer, the German-based company that acquired agrochemical giant Monsanto in 2018, said settlements in the US would bring about 75% of current claims to a close. The move comes after years of lawsuits from cancer patients who claimed Roundup caused non-Hodgkin lymphoma and that Monsanto failed to adequately warn consumers of the risk.

Those items are among 30 products that could be hit with steep tariffs as part of a longstanding US-European dispute over government subsidies to aircraft makers.

The World Trade Organization has previously sided with the US in the dispute, concluding in 2018 that the European Union helped Airbus with unfair subsidies that hurt sales of US-based Boeing's wide-body jets.

Cole.\nThe artists, from two completely different eras, have something in common: their songs of protest. For Holiday, it was the 1939 song \"Strange Fruit\" that stunned listeners with its horrifying depiction of black lynchings. For J. Cole, it was his 2020 single \"Snow on Tha Bluff,\" which he released in response to police brutality and ongoing protests over racism in the wake of George Floyd's death.\nThis may not seem like a typical class curriculum -- and that's the point. The workshop is called \"Protest Writing,\" and it's hosted by non-profit Mighty Writers, which provides reading and writing classes to low income and marginalized students in the Philadelphia area for free. The goal is have students meet and discuss pieces of protest inspired by the civil unrest they are seeing in their own communities in recent months.\n\"With the explosion of the Black Lives Matter movement and the unfortunate murder of George Floyd, that just added to the conversation,\" workshop instructor, Bartley Jeannoute told CNN. \"I just felt like this would be the best avenue to leverage my skills as a teacher and get in touch with what kids are saying and how they're feeling.\"\nJeannoute, a private school teacher at Abington Friends School in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, said a colleague encouraged him to reach out to Mighty Writers with his protest writing workshop proposal.\nHe said he felt it was important to teach a class where he could lay down some groundwork and arm his students with context from history so that they can better understand the movements happening right now.\nThe day's biggest stories in 10 minutes or less.\nSign up and get access to videos and weekly student quizzes.\nSign Me Up\nNo, Thanks\nBy subscribing you agree to our\nprivacy policy.\n\"There's so much that gets left out of the curriculum for these kids,\" he said. \"The conversations that these kids are having now, while they're at the forefront, they've been going on for a long time.\"\nCreating a space to creatively channel ideas\nA group of six students began meeting on July 6, with the workshop's end date set for Friday, July 17.\nGeorge Floyd's death has inspired a new generation of protest songs\nDuring the afternoon hour-long class, students read the historical work of W.E.B. Du Bois and Ida B. Wells and contemporary writers like Ta-Nehisi Coates and Nikole Hannah-Jones. They also analyze lyrics from artists, like Holiday and J. Cole, as well as Kendrick Lamar and Lauryn Hill.\nThe workshop culminates with a final writing assignment in the form of a poem, essay or spoken word, Jeannoute said.\n\"After surveying the history for Black oppression and protest writing, we are now examining current examples of protest writing in journalism,\" he said. \"We facilitated a very engaging conversation about how oppression manifests in almost every aspect of life as POC in America and in underfunded schools.\"\nOver the weekend, students will take time to work on their own narratives, drawing inspiration from the week's conversations.\nJeannoute said he's assigned two writing prompts: In what ways has Covid-19 directly impacted your life and learning? And/or speak about a specific event or instance of oppression. How can you use your voice to bring about change?\n\"We want to highlight the student experience and response but we are asking them to use Dr. Stephen Wilbers' 'Five Elements of Effective Writing,' he said. \"We'll give them the space to tell their story but it needs to be clear and structured.\"\nFrom the front lines, Black nurses battle twin pandemics of racism and coronavirus\nWith the events of this summer being the kind that make history, Jeannoute said he wanted to make sure students had a space to cope with what's going on in the world and discuss and creatively channel ideas.\nProtesting through a social media platform\nZion Perry, 16, a rising junior and workshop participant, told CNN she loves being able to log on from home and learn how to strengthen her writing and voice.\n\"I just want this workshop to help me become the powerhouse that I want to be,\" she told CNN.\nPerry's mom signed her up for the class. Having taken another class with Mighty Writers, she Perry she was excited at the thought of tying her ongoing social justice initiative with lessons from the workshop.\nPerry used to travel over 30 minutes from her Philadelphia home by public transport to get to her private school, Academy of the New Church in Bryn Athyn, Pennsylvania.\nBut since the pandemic forced her to stay at home and transition to an online-only format, she said it also gave her time to reflect on the education she was receiving and the racial inequality she was facing.\n\"It brought me to tears when I thought about how I was treated at my school,\" Perry said. \"There were many teachers at that school that just didn't believe in Black students being smart kids.\"\nPerry said she felt like teachers at Academy of the New Church would openly praise White students but wouldn't speak highly of any of her Black peers.\nThe workshop became a more formal extension of a project Perry was already doing on her own: Using Instagram as a form of protest to show what it is like to be \"Black at\" her private high school.\n\"I wanted to create this platform for Black women and men who don't feel like they're strong enough to stand up for themselves,\" she said. \"I used to be that student that would never speak up for a racial injustice so people could treat me any type of way.\"\nAs protests over the deaths of Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and Rayshard Brooks have filled US cities, Black students and alumni of some of the country's most prestigious private high schools have taken to social media to share their experiences of being Black at majority White elite private schools.\nWhen asked about Perry's account, the school told CNN they are listening to stories from students past and present in an effort to learn.\n\"We support all our students, alumni, and families in courageously speaking out about the hurt they experienced while attending our schools and we thank them for sharing input on how to make our schools better,\" an ANC spokesperson said.\n\"We are using their input and their voices together with other voices and professionals to help in formulating and implementing a plan to move forward with greater love and respect.\"\nAn ongoing fight for justice\nJeannoute said he's humbled to have been able to teach a class of this nature. In his experience, he said private schools provide \"a bit more latitude\" for kids to speak up about their ideas, whereas in public schools, some of those \"kids' voices get lost in the shuffle.\"\n\"This is an opportunity for me to give back to one of my principles of teaching, which is to give a voice to those who have been overlooked,\" he said.\nPerry said she and her siblings will not be going back to Academy of the New Church because of the racial inequality she said she has faced. Her family has moved to the Willow Grove area where she said she plans on attending a new school in the fall.\nAnd though she's changing schools, Perry said she will continue her fight against racial injustice -- because she doesn't want others to fight as hard as she has had to.\nCNN's Madeline Holcombe contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/10/us/christopher-columbus-statues-down-trnd/index.html", "headline": "Statues of Christopher Columbus are being dismounted across the country", "published_date": "2020-06-10", "text": "(CNN)As racial reckoning occurs across the country following the death of George Floyd, many Confederate statues -- which some consider racist symbols of America's dark legacy of slavery -- have been removed.\nNow, statues of Christopher Columbus, another controversial figure in US history, are also being taken down.

Some have described the actions of these select creators as \"shameless.\"\n\"People feel that it's okay to use protest and other tragic situations as political theater as props because they don't have a sense of consequences or propriety. It's shameless,\" Roberto Blake, an influencer, entrepreneur and educator, told CNN over Twitter.\n\"Whether it's an Instagram model in the streets or our leaders abusing sacred symbols, it's distasteful and entitled. If they put that time into planning a shoot instead into becoming educated about the issues, they wouldn't even contemplate it.\"\n'A lot of people do this kind of stuff'\nMike Metzler, a digital marketing manager, characterized the type of behavior exhibited by Schatzel and others as \"influencer opportunism.\"\n\"When you're an influencer and 'making content' is your job, you can begin to view every experience and part of your life as a 'possible' piece of content,\" Metzler told CNN over Twitter. \"This becomes a habit and a way of life for many influencers. But the truth is, not everything needs to be content, and there are certain situations where you really need to pause and read the room.\"\nTaylor Lorenz, a New York Times reporter who covers internet culture, said this type of opportunism isn't new.\nLast year, she wrote an article for The Atlantic about the backlash some influencers received after visiting Pripyat, Ukraine, the city left in ruin after the nuclear disaster at the Chernobyl power plant in 1986. The location spiked in popularity last summer due to the hit HBO miniseries \"Chernobyl.\"\nIn a way, what influencers did at Chernobyl is similar to what they've been seen doing around the US over the past few weeks, Lorenz told CNN.\n\"Influencer culture is so pervasive now,\" Lorenz said in a phone interview. \"Everyone is trying to capture their experiences and communicate their feelings about this very fraught subject and racism in general.\"\n\"This woman obviously missed the mark but a lot of people do this kind of stuff,\" Lorenz said, referring to Schatzel.\nA notable example of another influencer turning the demonstrations into an excuse to promote themselves involved one of YouTube's biggest stars.\nEarlier this month, Jake Paul was charged with criminal trespass and unlawful assembly after video showed him at a Scottsdale, Arizona, mall as it was being looted, police said.\nThe 23-year-old, who has 20.1 million followers on YouTube, was present during the looting and property destruction that happened at the city's Fashion Square mall on May 30, the Scottsdale Police Department said in a Facebook post.\nVideo taken by his photographer and posted by another user to Twitter appeared to show Paul outside the mall as people were attempting to break in.\n'People go to protests to be heard': Reflections on the '60s and today\nLater, the footage appears to show him inside the mall along with others after it had closed. It is unclear whether Paul took anything, and he has not been charged with any theft or vandalism that occurred.\nPaul, whose older brother Logan Paul is also a famous YouTube creator, said that he nor anyone else he was with was engaged in looting or vandalism, and that his group was tear gassed by police.\nThis isn't the first time Paul has faced controversy. He was booted from Disney Channel in 2017, and has since utilized his online popularity -- most notably from the former short-form video platform Vine -- to keep eyeballs on his content.

For more than a century, it's been called Ole Miss. It sounds like folksy shorthand for Old Mississippi.\nThe term's actual origin is more unsettling.\nIn 1896, a fraternity-backed council asked students to name the new school yearbook. Student Elma Meek proffered Ole Miss.\nShe borrowed it from the vernacular of the antebellum \"darkey,\" who used it as a term of reverence for the slave master's wife, Meek told the university newspaper in 1937.\nThe story, which explains how the term became \"the valued possession\" of the university at large, ran under the headline: \"Ole Miss takes its name from darky dialect, not abbreviation of state.\"\nThe day's biggest stories in 10 minutes or less.\nSign up and get access to videos and weekly student quizzes.\nSign Me Up\nNo, Thanks\nBy subscribing you agree to our\nprivacy policy.\nPlenty of students and alum say the name has evolved to embody all that's good about the northwest Mississippi school and its traditions. Others -- including many Black students, who make up 12.5% of the student body in a state where African Americans compose triple that percentage of the population -- point to Meek's words and ask: How could Ole Miss mean something else?\n\"I had often heard old 'darkies' on Southern plantations address the lady in the 'big house' as 'Ole Miss,'\" Meek told the school paper 40 years after the term's advent. \"I have never thought much about the matter, for I never dreamed, of course, that the term would grow into such popularity and favor.\"\nShe felt the term was a tribute to Southern women, the paper reported.\n'We will continue to use the terms'\nTo be clear, this isn't breaking news. The Ole Miss origin story is an open secret. Two sources, with something less than conviction, offered an alternate theory -- about a train that ran from Memphis to New Orleans -- but the tale doesn't withstand academic or journalistic rigor.\nOn its own website, the university explains Elma Meek Hall, which houses the art department, is named for \"the student who submitted the name Ole Miss for the name of the annual yearbook; Ole Miss subsequently became synonymous with the University of Mississippi.\" A cached version of a 2013 university yearbook webpage also credits Meek.\nA Confederate statue on campus is lowered as part of relocation process earlier this month.\nThe university declined CNN's requests to discuss the matter with the chancellor or provost, saying, \"Our leadership is absorbed with Covid-19 planning as we prepare to resume on-campus operations safely.\"\nIn 2016, then-Chancellor Jeffrey Vitter tamped down concern about the university retiring Ole Miss or its mascot, the Rebels, saying the university would continue to use them because they're popular and have taken on new meanings. A Rebel was no longer a Confederate; she or he was now \"someone who bucks the status quo,\" he wrote.\n\"I can assure you that we will continue to use the terms Ole Miss and Rebels as endearing nicknames for the university,\" Vitter wrote.\nUM has been here before\nThe Battle of Ole Miss hasn't materialized with the same intensity as fights over Robert E. Lee statues, but on a campus with so many remnants of the Confederacy in an era of increasing intolerance for the tributes, it could be next. Traditionalists have been steeling themselves for it, gathering on social media to preemptively defend Ole Miss' honor.\nThey see what's happened across the nation since Floyd's death. His killing ignited a simmering movement to redefine the legacies of Confederates and other historic figures -- and statues have dropped like bowling pins since.\nTributes to Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson and Jefferson Davis have already fallen. Military bases with Confederate namesakes, such as Fort Benning and Fort Bragg, are in the crosshairs. Vice President John Calhoun's name was stripped from buildings Clemson. His statue fell in Charleston. Princeton nixed President Woodrow Wilson. In some instances, protesters have pulled the tributes down themselves.\nTo understand the coming conflagration, know the University of Mississippi has been in a state of war over ideas for more than two decades. Its 1997 \"stick ban\" was viewed as a slick way of getting Confederate flags out of football games without irking alumni. UM booted its mascot, Colonel Reb, six years later. It stopped flying the Confederate-themed state flag in 2015. It quit playing \"Dixie\" at games. The school, too, has rechristened buildings and added \"contextualization plaques\" to others, some built by slaves.\nGuard Blake Hinson transferred to Iowa State, citing UM's ties to the Confederacy.\nUniversity leaders were more resistant to demands they take down a 30-foot Confederate monument that has stood prominently on campus since 1906, but the statue was relocated this month. A new controversy sprouted when plans surfaced for a privately funded facelift for the statue's new location that will cost up to $1.2 million. Opponents accuse the university of building a shrine to the Lost Cause of the Confederacy.\n\"It feels like you're in the Upside Down. Everywhere else in the country these statues are coming down,\" UM associate history professor Anne Twitty said. \"You feel like you're fighting the battle of 15, 20 years ago.\"\nThinking back on the struggles she's seen since joining the faculty in 2010, she said, \"The battle over Ole Miss will be particularly hot.\"\nLast month, Blake Hinson, a guard on UM's basketball team, put the school's ties to the Confederacy in the headlines by transferring to Iowa State.\n\"I'm proud not to represent that flag anymore and to not be associated with anything representing the Confederacy,\" the Florida native told The Daytona Beach News-Journal in June. Iowa State would not make Hinson available for an interview.\nAlso last month, the university esports team dropped all references to \"Rebels.\"\nThe dangerous messaging at play\nJack Carey received his master's and doctorate at the university. He devoted a section of his dissertation to \"the invention of Ole Miss\" and is writing a book, \"Jim Crow U.,\" about flagship Southern universities during segregation.\nThe story of Ole Miss' origin, he said, is but one example of the school's deliberate efforts to hitch its image to the Old South and Confederacy. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries -- as old Confederates convulsed at the notion of civil rights and crafted Jim Crow laws to strip Black people of rights -- the university covered the campus with Old South iconography, Carey and others say.\n\"There's really no ambiguity about what (Elma Meek's) tapping into: a romanticized vision of the Old South and slavery,\" said Carey, a University of Alabama instructor of American studies. \"A lot of people don't think that much about it, which makes it all the more important to acknowledge the origin. It's quite a bit to try to explain away or rationalize.\"\nAside from sending an unwelcoming message to more than a third of the state's residents, who are Black -- along with those who feel those residents' lives and feelings matter -- retaining the nickname poses deeper dangers in its messaging, he said:\n\"It requires imagining enslaved people felt affection or endearment toward slaveholders.\"\nIt props up the myth of the White savior, a paternalistic figure who was necessary to civilize the Black race.\nAnd it ignores the brutality, violence and force necessary to maintain slavery.\nBy romanticizing slavery, Carey said, an institution doesn't have to confront it.\n\"To speak honestly about the origin requires a pretty serious reckoning not just with the name but also the institution's identity,\" Carey said.\nBy fighting to keep its name and other holdovers of the Confederacy, he said, the university sends a strong message to prospective Black students: \"Go somewhere else.\"\n\"That is not the way that a flagship state university should be imagining itself,\" Carey said. \"That's really exclusionary in terms of who that university would welcome, and its commitment to academic freedom and diversity of thought.\"\n'I think rebellion is a good thing'\nNot everyone concurs with Carey. On Facebook and in interviews, many students and alumni -- and some would argue most -- feel the same way the university does about keeping Ole Miss. Despite their alignment with university leaders, they worry because the school has defended traditions like Colonel Reb and \"Dixie\" in the past, only to relent under pressure, said Howie Morgan, a 2000 graduate and political consultant.\nMorgan co-founded the Colonel Reb Foundation in 2003 to honor the wishes of the 94% of students who voted that year to keep the colonel, he said.\n\"I think the problem that anyone's going to have in the current climate is the University of Mississippi, through its leadership over the last several decades, has not been honest with the students, alumni and fan base in their argument to change the symbols,\" he said.\nGrowing up with Southern parents in Vicksburg, \"I didn't know what racism was,\" he said. The Confederate flag is just a symbol -- \"the Cowboy hat of the South\" -- made popular by Lynyrd Skynyrd and \"The Dukes of Hazzard,\" he said.\nA Mississippi fan takes a picture with some dressed up a former mascot, Colonel Reb, in 2015.\nThat the Ku Klux Klan and other hatemongers co-opted the flag after the Civil War is just an example of groups stealing symbols, he said: \"The Klan also used an American flag. The Nazis also stole a Christian symbol.\"\nHe frowns on efforts to change Ole Miss or Rebels, echoing his alma mater's assertion that they've taken on new meanings. Those who fought for suffrage and to end child labor were rebels, he said.\n\"I think rebellion is a good thing,\" he said.\nHe worries outside pressure is pushing administrators to \"change from a niche market into a more bland university so we would blend in with all the other universities across the United States.\"\n'We're destined to repeat the bad'\nFor senior Lauren Moses, a columnist for the school paper, the controversial symbols, along with Ole Miss and Rebels, are not honors. They're reminders, she said.\n\"Things that happened around the Civil War, we remember those things. We don't celebrate them, but we remember. I don't think the majority of students who utter the words support neo-Nazis or racism,\" she said. \"For me, Ole Miss means both the good parts and the bad parts of our history.\"\nWhen graduate student Zach Borenstein wrote a February column urging students to stop saying Ole Miss (he'd be charged months later with vandalizing the Confederate statue), Moses fired back with a litany of traditions, including James Meredith integrating the school in 1962, that she associated with Ole Miss.\nJames Meredith sits on a park bench in Jackson with Keri Herrington and Eriyuanna Woods last month.\n\"From changing the school mascot to governing bodies voting to move the Confederate statue to contextualizing many buildings on campus, Ole Miss has lost its identity,\" the 21-year-old wrote. \"Those who do not take the time to understand the importance of tradition may never know the beauty of our campus.\"\nShe sees it as a microcosm of what's happening across the nation, where historic figures such as Christopher Columbus and Thomas Jefferson are removed from the context of their history and unfairly measured by today's norms and moral codes, she said.\n\"I see a sort of nihilism. We're trying to whitewash our history and get rid of everything that's bad,\" she told CNN. \"I think that's dangerous for society and dangerous for Ole Miss specifically. We're destined to repeat the bad.\"\n'If they're not willing to unlearn, we're at a standstill'\nCarl Tart, 22, the university's first homecoming king, faced backlash when he told his family he was attending UM. Relatives disapproved of its racist and Confederate history, he said, but he had attended an all-Black high school in Yazoo City.\n\"I knew the world wasn't going to be all Black,\" he said. \"I wanted to learn how to navigate the world with people who are different from me.\"\nOnce on campus, he'd experience a range of racism. He shared anecdotes about hateful messages Facebook and screen grabs of death threats on Snapchat targeting Black students. Other bigotry he experienced was more Archie Bunker than Bull Connor, he said.\nWhite students at pep rallies couldn't tell star wide receiver D.K. Metcalf from other Black players, he said. They'd blurt out the n-word while singing along with rap music in local bars. At tailgates in The Grove, Tart and other Black students had to check each other's backs to make sure no one put \"Our State Flag\" stickers on them. Unwilling to study in halls named for racists (the contextualization plaques \"didn't go far enough\"), Tart did most of his schoolwork at home, he said.\nDespite his stature, 6-foot-5 and almost 300 pounds, he found himself anxious when a vehicle pulled alongside him bearing the Confederate flag.\n\"I tense up because I have no idea if these people are about to target me. I have no clue what's going to happen from this point forward,\" he said.\nOn June 19, he issued an ultimatum: If his alma mater breaks ground on a shrine glorifying the relocated Confederate statue, count him out of any marketing initiatives expected of him as homecoming king.\n\"It's time for change and change is happening whether people like it or not. We have to start leaving behind these old traditions and these old prejudiced ways and bring positivity to the change,\" he said.\nNow a graduate student at Louisiana State, Tart bristles at the idea Ole Miss can be \"rebranded\" with new meaning. He doesn't understand how university leaders can continue to justify its use, he said.\n\"We're expected to basically assimilate into a culture that's not ours. You can teach a person so many things, but if they're not willing to unlearn, we're at a standstill,\" he said. \"It's not OK you're allowing Black students to live in fear.\"\nA conflicted Black student experience\nArielle Hudson, a Rhodes scholar and outgoing president of the Black Student Union, which has been demanding the removal of UM's Confederate tributes for decades, says changing Ole Miss is trickier than altering the state flag or moving a statue.\n\"The biggest problem is Ole Miss is a brand. It's making money,\" she said.\nThe 22-year-old graduated in May and is destined for the other Oxford, in England, come fall, but she has made the drive from her hometown, Tunica, for campus protests. The statue has spawned a few.\nOle Miss has come to represent the school's strong sports programs and academics, supporters say.\nWhen Borenstein was charged with vandalizing the statue, she raised his bail money because \"his stance was strong. I wanted to help him out.\" (Borenstein's case remains open, according to the Lafayette County Justice Court.)\nAs a young orientation ambassador, Hudson recalls debunking \"wild\" rumors from prospective Black students -- no, the KKK doesn't live on campus; no, they're not still lynching people in Oxford -- while affirming other disturbing elements of the university's history.\n\"Some of this stuff happened, but that doesn't mean you don't belong here,\" she'd tell them.\nShe occasionally wears Ole Miss apparel but takes a harder line on Rebels gear. Her aunt won't wear any of it, she said. Depending on Hudson's audience, Ole Miss might slip out in conversation, but never in interviews or academic settings. Still, Hudson thinks the sobriquet sends a negative message, she said.\n\"I think it definitely means we haven't come to terms with all the history of the University of Mississippi and our role with slavery, with Jim Crow, within the Reconstruction era,\" she said.\nHonesty and transparency are often missing from the debate, she said, echoing a complaint heard from both sides. Administrators too often announce a victory, only to hatch secret plans \"to glorify Lost Cause mythology rather than contextualize Civil War history,\" which is what Hudson believes happened with the statue, she said.\nReal dialogue means listening to all sides and using opposing arguments to hone her own, she said.\nJefferson Davis descendent: State flag should represent population 01:08\n\"You have to get more people engaged with that history and understanding that history,\" she said. \"Education pulls people to your side.\"\nAdministrators also do the right things for the wrong reasons, she and other students and faculty complained.\nThe stadium stick ban was purportedly about safety, rather than denouncing the Confederate flag. Ditching \"Dixie\" and Colonel Reb were couched as efforts to make pregame more inclusive. The new names for buildings and the statue relocation came after a consulting firm said such honors hurt the school's reputation.\n\"That's not the only problem or the main problem,\" she said, explaining that just once she'd like hear university leaders say, \"No matter how much it costs or how much we lose, it's wrong and we're going to take it down.\""}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/04/us/five-things-june-4-trnd/index.html", "headline": "5 things to know for June 4: George Floyd, protests, coronavirus, stimulus, oil spill", "published_date": "2020-06-04", "text": "Get '5 Things' in your inbox\nIf your day doesn't start until you're up to speed on the latest headlines, then let us introduce you to your new favorite morning fix.

Retired Gen. John Allen criticized Trump's photo op in front of a church during the protests, saying it was trying to use religion to gloss over an abuse of First amendment rights.

Fill me in.\nB: After the company's CEO praised President Donald Trump, many Latinos -- the company focuses on the culinary tastes of Latino cultures -- said that they're going to boycott. Predictably, some people, including Texas Sen.

Kelly, whom many have tried to cancel for his sexual abuse charges. But his music still gets played, regardless of whether people choose to engage with it. So is it even possible to cancel someone? What does that term even mean?\nB: I think of cancel culture as a sort of shell game: Its detractors say that they're about free speech, about protecting the First Amendment, but what they're really about, it appears, is freedom from criticism and accountability. To me, it's a term that's just so imprecise and incendiary that it's meaningless.\nL: OK, that's true. I agree that the term itself has basically lost all meaning. But it's an interesting concept, if only because it forces people to look at things as black or white: This person is bad, so we have to cancel them, and never again engage with them. Which isn't how life works. I mean, R. Kelly is referenced enough that he still has some cultural capital, you know?\nB: That gets at another problem I have with how cancel culture is tossed around. Most of the people who've been canceled haven't actually been canceled. The supposedly canceled tend to remain influential. R. Kelly's music is still available on Spotify. Dave Chappelle is still releasing comedy specials. JK Rowling is still a global icon and multimillionaire.\nLike \"political correctness,\" cancel culture is a flimsy, facile framework for social and political realities that can't be boiled down so easily. At their core, these are complicated conversations about power, about people -- women and people of color -- making their voices heard after being ignored for so long.\nThink about it: Who are the people usually characterized as cancelers? If we go back to the Goya example, it's Latinos, who are pushing back against a CEO's flattery of a President who's spent his time in office disparaging Latino communities in a racist manner. With Rowling, it's transgender communities and their allies, who are rebuking someone who's trafficking in harmful, essentialist notions of gender.\nL: Exactly! This idea of canceling someone is so vague. Like, remember when Shane Gillis, who was almost on \"Saturday Night Live,\" was fired for his racist jokes? So many people were all \"cancel culture strikes again,\" rather than actually grappling with the fact that Gillis was merely being held accountable for his actions. These situations always get labeled as \"angry internet mobs go after a celebrity,\" as if the celebrity did nothing wrong.\nB: A friend put it to me like this: \"Tell me your views on cancel culture, and I'll tell you who you are.\"\nIn short: power\nThe mass reckoning playing out across the country -- on university campuses, in newsrooms, on streets -- is about one thing: power. That makes sense, given that America was founded on extending control to a few while withholding it from the rest.\nOr in short: \"everything unsettling that is happening right now, in this moment -- perhaps, in yet another letter you've read -- is about power. who has it, who wants it, how its wielded, and what it means to challenge and upend that,\" as New York Times Magazine writer Jenna Wortham recently tweeted.\nThe historical context\nEartha Kitt and the Johnson administration\nCancel culture: What a hazy term!\nIts critics often conflate First Amendment-enshrined free speech with immunity from disagreement, including on social media. There's a dizzying amount of irony here: The people with healthy platforms -- columns at magazines, lucrative book deals, the White House -- are the ones who often believe that free speech is under siege. Meanwhile, the supposed cancelers are people who, until recently, had very little opportunity to meaningfully shape national conversations.\nHistory offers us an example of what being suppressed actually looks like -- and it's far worse than the sting of Twitter rage. In January 1968, the singer, actor, and activist Eartha Kitt attended a White House luncheon on juvenile crime. (She went reluctantly, according to her autobiography, because she \"felt a con coming on.\") When it was her turn to speak, she excoriated Lyndon B. Johnson's administration and America's involvement in the Vietnam War.\n\"You send the best of this country off to be shot and maimed. They rebel in the street. They will take pot ... and they will get high. They don't want to go to school because they're going to be snatched off from their mothers to be shot in Vietnam,\" Kitt said. \"Because there is a war on and I pray that there will be a just and honest peace -- that still doesn't give us a free ticket not to try to work for better things such as against crime in the streets, for better education and better health for our people.\"\nAfter that event, Kitt's career cratered. According to a 1978 New York Times article, \"the Central Intelligence Agency, asked by the Secret Service in 1968 about Eartha Kitt, produced an extensive report containing secondhand gossip about the entertainer but no evidence of any foreign intelligence connections.\"\nUnable to find employment in America, she worked for several years in Europe.\nIn all that is a lesson about proportion. Cancel culture's detractors may not like suddenly having to engage with historically marginalized groups -- but true, government-sanctioned suppression of free speech and diverging opinions is happening all around them, and has been for a long time.\nRecommended for your eyes and ears\nIs there anything that wouldn't benefit from Viola Davis' presence?\nVanity Fair's latest edition is yet more proof that the answer is no.

In a genre steeped in both Whiteness and the male gaze (hello, \"Catwoman\"), this Netflix blockbuster, directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood, a Black woman, feels like an action film for everyone else.\nShe takes the backgrounds of Black and gay characters and elevates them in a way that's sweet and focused but not contrived.\nIt just goes to show you how much power White people have had for so long, and it illuminates what other stories we can tell when other people are behind the camera.\nAs many in America begin to have difficult conversations on race, similar questions are being raised in other countries in light of the protests here.\nJust look at France, a country that prides itself on its assimilation narrative.\nThe New York Times explored the cultural shift happening there among first- and second-generation immigrants -- and how this shift could shake up the very essence of French society.\nAround the office\nWhy Black Christians are bracing for a 'whitelash'\nDaniel Burke, CNN's religion reporter, wrote about how Black Christians are bracing for \"whitelash\" -- the moment when White Christians tire of continuing the conversation on race after the death of George Floyd, and once again begin to bristle at such topics.\nHe writes: \"White Christian leaders have prayed at vigils and marched in protests, damned the officers accused of killing Floyd and recited the slogan Black Lives Matter, often while distancing themselves from the organization of the same name. One evangelical magazine, Christianity Today, called for a church-led reparations project. But even as they appreciate the scales falling from some White Christians' eyes, some Black Christians remain wary.\""}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/30/us/minneapolis-business-support-protest-riot-gandhi-mahal-trnd/index.html", "headline": "Minneapolis businesses, including some that were damaged, are standing in solidarity with protesters", "published_date": "2020-05-31", "text": "(CNN)The death of George Floyd, an unarmed and handcuffed black man, while in Minneapolis police custody has triggered nights of protests and violence in cities across the country.\nIn Minneapolis, where former police officer Derek Chauvin has been charged in Floyd's death, demonstrators have voiced their anger in chants and on placards. But the protests have also led to outbreaks of violence.\nHundreds of businesses in the state's Twin Cities -- Minneapolis and St. Paul -- were damaged or looted during four days of unrest.\nYet some of those business owners are still voicing their support for protesters.\nTheir restaurant burned, but they're standing tall\nIn the midst of the protests and violence in Minneapolis stood a popular local restaurant: the Gandhi Mahal.\nRuhel Islam, the business owner who immigrated from Bangladesh 24 years ago to escape state violence, started his business nearly 13 years ago. It burned to the ground during the unrest Thursday night.\nWhen he found out, Islam said he only had one response: \"Let my building burn. Justice needs to be served and those officers need to be put in jail.\"\nHis daughter, Hafsa Islam, said her family went from their normal routine of making curry to transforming their restaurant into a safe haven for injured protesters who needed first aid.\n\"We were worried about business, of course, but we were more worried about the protesters,\" she said. \"All of Tuesday and Wednesday we took in hundreds of injured people. By Thursday night, it felt too dangerous to be there.\"\nRuhel Islam standing on the rooftop of what is left of his restaurant, the Gandhi Mahal.\nAs the evening raged on, Hafsa said locals did their best to protect Gandhi Mahal by standing in front of it, but within hours, its windows were broken and by morning their restaurant had turned into ashes.\nDespite the loss of their business and their stance against violence, Hafsa said they were standing in support of protesters and their cause.\n\"This isn't about the business, this is about us, this is about George Floyd and all of the people whose lives have been taken wrongfully because of police brutality,\" she said. \"We are fighting for justice in such an unjust system.\"\nSince Gandhi Mahal burned down, more than $79,400 has been raised for the business. While some of the money will be used to rebuild the Bangladeshi eatery, the rest will go towards helping other local uninsured businesses that have been damaged, Hafsa said.\nIslam added that the city cannot expect peace until it solves the root of the problem, which he said is police brutality.\n\"I grew up in a Third World country surrounded by the violence I'm seeing now,\" he said. \"I don't want to see it here. I don't want a police state traumatizing its people. It's time to make a change. We can't make any more excuses for police. This is America. We are here for justice.\"\nThey transformed their bookstore into a safe space\nMoon Palace Books, a bookstore and restaurant in Minneapolis, was one of the many businesses caught in the middle of the protests. But instead of turning people away, owner Jamie Schwesnedl and his wife, Angela, decided to transform their business into a safe space.\nSchwesnedl hung an \"Abolish the Police\" sign in a window and refused to allow officers to use their parking lot and outdoor space as a staging ground.\n\"We were not going to allow them to prepare or do something like that on our property,\" Schwesnedl told CNN.\nMoon Palace Books before it was vandalized and boarded up.\nThe couple transformed their space into a \"harm free zone,\" where people set up medic stations for injured protesters to wash out tear gas and clean their wounds.\nThe bookstore, which had windows broken and was vandalized with graffiti, is one of the many businesses standing in support of protesters, \"no matter what.\"\n\"People are furious, and rightly so,\" Schwesnedl said of the community's ongoing issues with police. \"There's no government organization or person in the city actually listening to people, hearing their pain and their anger, and addressing their concerns.\"\n\"I don't know what the hell is going on, but it should not be the job of small business owners to keep our customers and our neighbors and our community safe from the police, and yet here we are.\"\nThey're using their tattoo parlor to inspire protesters\nA tattoo parlor in Minneapolis did not waste any time to show its support for protesters.\nEmi Nijiya, the owner of Jackalope Tattoo, told CNN they decided to board up the shop on Friday and spray supportive messages across the storefront.\nUsing spray paint, Nijiya, their wife, and coworkers covered the shop with slogans and quotes to inspire protesters. Among them was Martin Luther King Jr.'s famous words: \"A riot is the language of the unheard.\"\n\"I think a lot of people think that these riots are not part of our history and that they don't do anything,\" Nijiya said. \"This was our way of saying yes, this is justified and it is something we should be fighting for. We need to be fighting for change.\"\nEmi Nijiya, left, and Amo Azure spray paint their tattoo parlor with slogans in support of protesters.\nWhile Nijiya said they knew protesters could still damage their parlor, it did not change their stance on the protests.\n\"We fully support people who are rioting and protesting for the cause and fighting for those lives, but we do not support what is being done by white supremacists and people outside the state coming in just to cause chaos and make this movement like something different than it is,\" Nijiya added.\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz and other officials said on Saturday that violence in Minneapolis was being fueled by outsiders and that vandals are largely nonresidents of the cities with no interest in Floyd's death. The governor estimated only 20% of protesters there are Minnesotans.\n\"We will always stand with the protesters,\" Nijiya said, before adding that businesses could afford to lose money but \"we can't afford to lose these people's lives.\""}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/21/us/demonstrators-reimagine-public-safety-without-police/index.html", "headline": "Demonstrators say public safety re-imagined is a future without police", "published_date": "2020-06-21", "text": "(CNN)Tony Williams remembers pulling into a gas station in rural Minnesota late one night after getting lost on his way back home to Minneapolis in 2018. He saw a couple of police cars parked on the lot and thought he'd ask for directions. Williams, a black man, pulled his car in near them and two white officers immediately jumped out and ran to him, both with one hand on a holstered gun and the other holding a flashlight that shined in his face.\nWilliams did what society conditioned him to do in such situations: he put both hands up in the air.\n\"I was acutely aware as a black man that my life was in danger in that moment if I didn't have the right answers,\" said Williams, an organizer with MPD150, a Minneapolis effort created by local organizers that supports the dismantling of the city's police department and the reallocation of police funding to community-based organizations without a history of violence.\n\"What I needed then was not militarized folks who were worried that they're under attack at any given moment,\" Williams added. \"It really drove home for me that even in the most benign of circumstances, police are a threat to me.\"\nActivists, like Williams, who are calling for the defunding and abolition of police, say the future of public safety doesn't need to include police forces that systematically oppress black people, marginalized communities and communities of color.\nInstead, public safety could mean supporting and funding a network of organizations, health care providers, social service agencies, religious and community leaders and others who provide safety, support and prevention. Directing funding in that way would lead to a decline in crimes linked to poverty and systemic disinvestment, activists say.\nOnce thought to be a pipedream that bounced around activist circles, the idea of public safety without the police forces of today has turned into a viable policy platform in the wake of the death of George Floyd and the protests that have followed. Floyd, a black man, pleaded that he couldn't breathe while he was held down with a knee to his neck by a former Minneapolis police officer.\n\"We are seeing the political shift that is happening in real time here,\" David Kennedy, director of National Network for Safe Communities and a criminal justice professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice said.\n'I have...zero examples of police helping me'\nBut there's no one vision for what a future without today's police would look like.\nOn one end of the spectrum, it means pulling money out of policing budgets and redistributing it to community-based intervention programs and services. Instead of sending an officer to a mental health or a domestic abuse call, for instance, a team of crisis workers who are better equipped to de-escalate and provide rehabilitation services would respond. In that example, some sort of policing force would remain, called on for violent situations.\nOn the other end of the spectrum, the goal is to completely abolish police in the US. Policing, some activists say, profits punishment over rehabilitation because of its origin as slave patrols that paid vigilantes to recapture escaped slaves.\n\"My horizon goal is a future where people are not policed,\" said Kristiana Col\u00f3n, an afro-Latina playwright, poet and co-founder of Chicago's #LetUsBreathe collective, which began in 2014 as a way to support protesters on the ground at the Florissant Avenue encampment in Ferguson.\nCol\u00f3n, who works to bring the abolition of police to Chicago, said she is still recovering from being beaten by officers during the initial days of the demonstrations following Floyd's death.\n\"I have absolutely zero examples of the police helping me,\" she told CNN in an interview, recalling an instance when she couldn't get police to file a report about a break in at her home.\n\"I kept reaching out to them as though that's going to happen. And that's simply not how they function,\" she said.\nPeople walk down 16th street after \"Defund The Police\" was painted on the street near the White House.\nCities are reallocating money from police budgets\nIn the wake of Floyd's death, pushed by activists and the protests that have followed, some cities have announced plans to shift money from police departments.\nIn Los Angeles, Mayor Eric Garcetti and Police Commissioner Eileen Decker announced that the city's police budget would not be increased as planned and $100 million to $150 million would be reallocated to \"further enhance community neighborhood policing.\" New York City Mayor Bill DeBlasio said he would reallocate some of the NYPD's $6 billion budget to youth and social services, reversing an April budget proposal that suggested cutting $400 million from the same programs.\nBut no place in the country has gone as far as Minneapolis recently, where nine members of the city council -- a veto-proof majority -- pledged at a community meeting on June 7 to dismantle the police department in its current form.\nDemonstrators marching to defund the Minneapolis Police Department pause outside the Minneapolis Police and Fire Union Office on June 6.\n'Case study for a new era of how to enhance public safety'\nLast week, 12 city council members unanimously approved a resolution to declare the intent to create a \"transformative new model\" of policing in the city, setting off a year-long process to envision and create a new way to keep people safe.\nFive members also announced their intent to introduce a charter amendment for the November ballot of this year, which would propose the elimination of the Minneapolis Police Department to create \"a new Charter Department to provide for community safety and violence.\" A tedious process, according to local reporters, if it makes it to the ballot and is approved by voters, it would remove MPD from the city's charter and the city could begin to dismantle it. Activists say this would circumvent Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, who has said he's not in favor of dismantling.\nThe council's moves come after years of organizing from community activist groups including Black Visions Collective, Reclaim the Block, Black Lives Matter Minneapolis and MPD150.\nAfter a series of high-profile killings by the police in Minneapolis and demonstrations to demand action, Black Visions Collective along with Reclaim the Block began a campaign in 2018 that organized hundreds of community members to go to city budget hearings and explain to their council members what makes them feel safe. More often than not, the answer was not police presence.\nThose efforts bore fruit after video of Floyd's death went viral and protests began.\nMinneapolis Councilmember Steve Fletcher said police weren't responding to 911 calls during the initial days of the protests, so community leaders and activists started emergency troubleshooting. Some of his colleagues, Fletcher said, broke curfew to organize neighborhood watches while he and others took calls and emails from citizens to resolve issues in the middle of the night.\n\"We were deeply engaged in the kind of community problem solving and crisis work that both brought people together and showed people how much community capacity for problem solving we have. And also, prompted a lot of in a very tough conversation among us informally,\" Fletcher said.\nExactly what dismantling the police department in its current will look like in Minneapolis is unknown. Some say they don't want it to look like Camden, New Jersey, which broke its police unions, hired more officers for less money and implemented reforms, but residents still experience aggressive surveillance and policing, according to criminology professor Brendan McQuade.\nStill, Fletcher says he's heard from his constituents that they'd like to have some sort of tactical force with the capacity to respond to dangerous situations. The rest will be decided with massive input from the community and organizers, along with the city council.\nTwo police officers stand outside the Third Police Precinct during the \"I Can't Breathe\" protest on May 27 in Minneapolis.\nResponding with prevention in mind\nIn a police-free future, activists described a world where communities decide what behavior is allowed and highlight the importance of neighbors -- not as watchdogs but as those who can respond with prevention in mind.\n\"There will be a focus on in-the-moment de-escalating a situation, and also making sure that everyone involved has the resources that they need,\" said Molly Glasgow, a member of MPD150.\nThe restorative process will focus on understanding why the issue happened in the first place, Glasgow said.\nIn the case of a robbery or violent crime, Williams highlighted the use of community patrols that arose during the demonstrations in effort to guard against crime for the short term, until more money is invested into social services.\n\"Our neighborhood defense networks were an important part of recognizing that it was a threat and defending folks against it,\" Williams said.\nAnother idea is to use an operator for emergency services that would direct 911 calls to a tactical force, fire department or a mental health crisis line depending on the situation instead of all calls going directly to the police. A version of it is already being used in Austin, Texas.\nAnother option is to deploy crisis teams, similar to the \"CAHOOTS\" program in Eugene, Oregon, that dispatch a medic, and crisis worker trained in the mental health field to each case.\nIn a police-free future, domestic violence cases could be handled not by relying on a carceral system, but by focusing on understanding where violence stems from, be it a mental health problem, a substance abuse problem, an unemployment problem or unaddressed trauma problem, Vitale said. Safety for the victim would be prioritized, as police typically respond to domestic violence calls after they've already been committed.\n\"What we want is a place in the community that people can go to and say, 'I got a problem. I need some help, but I don't want anyone sent to jail. I want to keep this family together if I can.' And if that doesn't work, then 'I need help getting out of this arrangement,'\" Vitale said, adding that communities can create violence centers or women centers with trained professionals to identify resources already present in their lives.\nOrganizers acknowledge the framework has to come together at a quick pace, even as potential challenges loom, including pushback from the police union.\nNon-profits may be guides for cities\nThere are guides for how Minneapolis might create its new reality -- though they exist on a smaller scale as non-profits or community-based programs funded by local governments.\nThe Health Alliance for Violence Intervention is one non-profit example. Used in hospitals in 70 cities across the nation, violence intervention specialists from the same community arrive after a victim has been admitted to the hospital. They sit bedside to run a retaliation screening asking what happened and if the victim is still in danger, while providing supportive resources. And if the victim identifies the perpetrator or a network of community members does, the specialist then goes to the assailant to identify if risks still remain -- hoping to bring both the victim and perpetrator into the organization, halting the cycle of violence and promoting restoration through mediation.\n\"We're able to lower violence and their likelihood of coming back into the hospital with another gunshot wound, we're really focusing on their health and healing,\" said Fatimah Loren Muhammad, HAVI executive director.\nThe process works in large part because they're not asking police-like investigation questions, but asking what the victim needs in effort to create a solution, as victims are less likely to talk to the police after injury, according to DLIVE executive director Ray Winans, a partner of the HAVI in Detroit.\n\"Our approach is never to go after the perpetrator in a sense of an investigation but it's to get the perpetrator and the victim and or the network of folks to sit down and have communication.\"\nAsked what challenges Minneapolis can expect during their transformational process, Muhammad said it's understanding the scale of investment that it will take. And without that, the initiative could fail.\n\"This is not a Band-Aid issue, right? We're talking about structural racism, we're talking about systems that have perpetrated harm or in whole communities for a long time. So, you've got to be very strategic and you've got to invest deeply,\" she said.\nCommunity knows 'best way to keep each other safe'\nEven organizers in favor of abolishing police departments still worry about what the future will look and what mechanisms will be put in place to handle crimes like sexual assault and violence, when the current system goes away.\n\"What are we going to put in place in order to make sure both things don't happen? And that's a larger reimagining of what liberation and freedom looks like for everybody moving forward,\" Fadumo Ali, an organizer and teacher based in Minneapolis said.\nBut organizers and council members, who during the June 7 community meeting asked attendees to write down what makes them feel safe along with their questions and concerns as the first of many conversations, anticipate setbacks.\n\"We actually want to be honest about the fact that it sounds scary because we're like, how are we going to keep ourselves safe? Our assertion is that our community knows the very best way to keep each other safe.\" Noor added.\nReplicating across the nation\nAs Minneapolis pioneers a plan to dismantle its police force, legislators at the federal level are not on the same page. Republicans have been looking to tie Democrats to the issue, while Democrats have voiced support for investing more in communities but not dismantling police forces.\n\"I think that a big part of this conversation really is about reimagining how we do public safety in America, which I support,\" Sen. Kamala Harris said on ABC's \"The View\" earlier this month.\n\"We have confused the idea that to achieve safety, you put more cops on the street instead of understanding to achieve safe and healthy communities you put more resources into the public education system of those communities, into affordable housing,\" among other initiatives.\nMinnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar said she was not in favor of \"abolishing public safety departments and police departments,\" but said conditions can be put on their funding.\nFederal legislators point to reforms like a major bill introduced in the House and Senate Democrats called the Justice in Police Act that would create a national ban on chokeholds as an acceptable use of force, create a National Police Misconduct Registry, provide incentives for local governments to conduct racial bias training for officers, and set caps on the transfer of military-grade equipment to law enforcement, among other initiatives.\nBut advocates of dismantling police forces say cities with some of the worst policing records have passed many of the reforms and not much has changed, as it falls on individual police chiefs to implement them and just lessens the amount of damage done by police officers instead of eradicating it.\n\"When we talk about reform, often what that looks like is more funding for the police justified by, 'oh, we're going to do more training, or we're going to do different kinds of training,'\" said Col\u00f3n. \"Reforms are to police what thoughts and prayers are to mass shootings.\"\nWilliams is one of the people pushing for not just reform, but what he says is transformative change through the abolition of police forces.\nOfficers eventually accepted that he wanted to ask them for directions, he said.\nBut they warned him that should he need directions again, he should park far away and approach officers with his hands up, so as not to look like a threat, Williams said.\n\"Police abolition is ultimately about getting our communities the things that they need to be successful.\"\nCNN's Sarah Moon, Manu Raju, Clare Foran and Aaron Cooper contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/27/us/minneapolis-george-floyd-police-death/index.html", "headline": "George Floyd's family says four officers involved in his death should be charged with murder", "published_date": "2020-05-27", "text": "(CNN)The family of George Floyd -- who died after pleading that he couldn't breathe while a police officer held him down with a knee on his neck -- say they want the four Minneapolis officers involved charged with murder.\n4 Minneapolis cops fired after video shows one kneeling on neck of black man who later died\n\"They were supposed to be there to serve and to protect and I didn't see a single one of them lift a finger to do anything to help while he was begging for his life.

No charges have been filed.\nThe Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis said in a statement the officers were cooperating in the investigation and urged \"now is not the time to rush to (judgment)\" while the officers' actions are examined.\nMinneapolis police said officers were responding to an alleged forgery Monday evening and were told a person later described as the suspect was sitting on a car. They found Floyd, who at that point was inside a car and police said he \"physically resisted\" after he got out. Officers handcuffed Floyd, who police said \"appeared to be suffering medical distress.\" He was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead, police said.\nVideo captured by bystanders at the scene of the arrest shows an officer with his knee pressed against the neck of the 46-year-old, who was handcuffed on the pavement, complaining that his body hurt and he couldn't breathe. Two officers handled the man on the ground while another stood nearby with his eyes on the bystanders as traffic passed.\nSurveillance video obtained from a nearby restaurant showed the first point of contact police had with the man. An officer escorts a handcuffed Floyd out of a car and Floyd sits on the sidewalk. Moments later, the officer and another escort Floyd away, still with his hands behind his back.\nGeorge's brother Rodney Floyd told CBS that he didn't believe George was resisting arrest.\n\"You have eyes.

They murdered my brother.\"\nA day after Floyd's death, hundreds gathered at the same intersection where he was pinned to the ground and they later marched to a police precinct to protest.\nThe protesters chanted \"No justice, no peace,\" and \"I can't breathe.\"\nSome demonstrators wheeled a shopping cart full of rocks just outside the precinct and dumped it on the ground for people to throw, a CNN team there reported. Police used tear gas to disperse the crowd after some people turned unruly, a spokesman for the police department said.\nAn undated photo of George Floyd, provided Wednesday to news media by Benjamin Crump, attorney for Floyd's family.\n'I can't breathe'\nThe video of Floyd's encounter with police that has circulated on social media shows one police officer with his knee on Floyd to keep him on the ground. \"Please, I can't breathe,\" the man says, protesting for several minutes before he becomes silent. Bystanders urge the officer to release the man from his hold.\nThere's one epidemic we may never find a vaccine for: fear of black men in public spaces\nThe technique is against department regulations, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said Tuesday, and the officer had no reasons to employ it.\n\"The technique that was used is not permitted; is not a technique that our officers get trained in on,\" he said. \"And our chief has been very clear on that piece. There is no reason to apply that kind of pressure with a knee to someone's neck.\"\nIn the video, the police officer's leg remains on Floyd for several minutes, even as the man is pleading for help. \"My stomach hurts,\" Floyd can be heard telling the officer. \"My neck hurts. Everything hurts.\"\nAt one point the Floyd says, \"Give me some water or something. Please. Please.\"\nBy the end of the video, he is seen motionless, with his eyes shut, lying on the pavement.\nThe incident recalls the 2014 death of Eric Garner, who also uttered the words \"I can't breathe\" while in a New York officer's chokehold. Since Garner's death, the phrase has become a rallying cry throughout the Black Lives Matter movement.\nThat officer never faced charges.

Primary elections\nVoters in Kentucky and New York head to the polls -- or face absentee ballot deadlines -- today, as Democratic incumbents and establishment favorites square off against progressive challengers. In Kentucky, former fighter pilot Amy McGrath is up against progressive state Rep. Charles Booker. Until a few weeks ago, McGrath was considered a shoo-in to take on Sen. Mitch McConnell in November. But Booker's campaign has seen a surge in momentum as the nation reckons with racism and police brutality and a pandemic that disproportionately hurts minorities and the poor. Interest in the race has increased turnout expectations and intensified fears of long lines at limited polling sites. In New York, newcomers Jamaal Bowman and Mondaire Jones are campaigning to replace the state's two longest-serving House members, Rep. Eliot Engel and Rep. Nita Lowey. And Rep.

Seattle's mayor told protesters who had taken over a police-free \"autonomous zone\" that it's time for them to go home.

In California, employees of a sheriff's and district attorney's office were among those arrested after multiple people were caught on a security camera vandalizing a Black Lives Matter sign, authorities said. And in Minneapolis, where ex-officer Derek Chauvin was charged with murder in the death of George Floyd, eight corrections officers at the jail where Chauvin is being held say they were briefly barred from his floor the day he was booked because of the color of their skin.\nCNN goes inside Seattle's autonomous zone 02:42\n5. Immigration\nThe Trump administration is once again barring immigrants from coming to the US -- this time through a number of new restrictions on visas for temporary foreign workers. A wide range of workers, from au pairs to software engineers, will be blocked from coming to the US until at least January, though there are exceptions. Trump's argument: The devastating economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic has forced officials to do more to protect American jobs. But immigrant rights advocates and tech companies that rely on the visa programs to bring in skilled workers aren't buying it. They accuse the Trump administration of using the crisis to further its immigration agenda and say the restrictions will ultimately hurt the economy.\nTrump: Immigration order to apply only to green cards 02:59\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\nJoel Schumacher, director of Batman movies and 'St. Elmo's Fire,' has died\nHe was best known for directing the divisive \"Batman Forever\" and \"Batman & Robin\" films in the '90s.\nSchumacher: 'Batman' is for the audience, not for me (1997) 00:59\nA package of smelly fruit sent 6 people to the hospital and caused an evacuation\nThat's one heck of a stench.\nApple wants your iPhone to replace your car keys\nGreat news for those of us who are always losing stuff.\nWidgets, face mask Memoji, car keys: Here's what's new on iOS 14 03:04\nWomen are less likely to swipe right on men posing with cats in their dating profiles\nBut do you really want to date someone who would swipe left on your sweet kitty?\nIf you're wondering whether signing that petition will change anything ...\nWell, it's complicated.\nTODAY'S QUOTE\n\"I wanted to show whoever it was that you're not going to take away my smile.

Protesters held signs that read \"End Racism\" and \"Black Lives Matter,\" according to CNN affiliate KTLA.\nPolice deemed the gathering an unlawful assembly, and asked the hundreds of protesters to disperse, police officials said in a statement.\nOne month ago, a different protest in the same Orange County community, which has a large Republican community, was left mostly alone.\nThousands turned up in early May, packed shoulder-to-shoulder, to demonstrate against California Gov. Gavin Newsom's order to close all beaches to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Messages on their signs read \"Don't Take Our Freedom\" and \"Open OC!\" They labeled Newsom a \"traitor.\"\nIt was not considered unlawful.\nSo what was different?\nCNN reached out to Huntington Police Department regarding the differences between the protests. They did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment. But in a statement, police officials said Sunday's protest became an \"unlawful assembly after protesters became violent with numerous assaults.\"\nDemonstrators protest against the state's stay-at-home order amid the coronavirus pandemic, on May 1, 2020 in California.\n'Stir crazy' at home\nIn late April, about a month in to Newsom's stay-at-home order, a heat wave hit Southern California.\nIn Los Angeles County, beaches remained closed. But Ventura and Orange Counties allowed citizens to go to the beach, as long as they adhered to a patchwork of guidelines and restrictions, including keeping parking lots closed to discourage outside visitors and limit crowds.\nSeeking relief from the heat, thousands crowded the beaches -- and photos quickly emerged of people packed under the sun in the sand, some not adhering to social distancing guidelines, others not sporting masks.\n\"It's a beautiful day,\" Frank Feerini, who was at Huntington Beach in Orange County, told CNN affiliate KABC on April 25. \"How can you keep anybody in? I think that people want to get out. I think they've been cooped up, I think they're going stir crazy.\"\nPeople enjoy the beach amid the novel coronavirus pandemic in Huntington Beach, California, on April 25, 2020.\nThe images prompted frustration and concern from Newsom.\n\"Those images are an example of what not to see, people, what not to do if we're going to make the meaningful progress that we've made in the last few weeks extend into the next number of weeks,\" Newsom, a Democrat, said of the images showcasing crowds of beachgoers in the state.\nThe following week, he ordered the closure of Orange County beaches, calling it a \"temporary pause.\"\nOrange County officials blamed \"misleading photographs\" for Newsom's decision, saying a telephoto lens made it look like there were more people on the beach than there were in reality.\nMichelle Steele, a county supervisor, said closing the beaches is \"a clear example of unnecessary government overreach.\"\nThe Huntington Beach City Council voted 5-2 in favor of directing the City Attorney to pursue any and all legal actions to challenge the beach closure, a news release from the city stated.\nTurns out, many residents felt the same way as the county's officials. On May 1, between 2,500 and 3,000 people attended protests over Newsom's order, according to Huntington Beach Police Chief Robert Handy.\nLarge protests following California governor's order closing beaches\nWhile the beach was technically closed, officers did not appear to be enforcing the governor's new closure order, CNN reported.\nOut of sight from protesters, riot patrol officers on horseback staged under the Huntington Beach Pier, with one officer telling CNN they were there \"just in case.\"\nOne protester walked past a line of officers blocking access to the beach and asked police officers if he was breaking the law. The officer responded, \"Yes, you are technically entering an unauthorized area,\" but did not stop the protester as he proceeded past the line of officers and to the ocean.\nOrange County reported a 22% increase in coronavirus cases amid protests to reopen beaches.\nThe protest came on the heels of many similar nationwide protests -- in both red and blue states -- over stay-at-home orders. People grew concerned about the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, and demanded the states reopen, even as cases continued to rise and the virus was far from contained.\nAfter the standoff with Newsom, California allowed three cities -- including Huntington Beach -- to begin reopening its coastlines.\n\"I cannot impress upon people more that we're not going back to normal,\" Newsom said. \"It's back to a new normal, with adaptations and modifications until we get to immunity, until we get to a vaccine. We'll get there.\"\nDemanding justice in the streets\nAlmost one month later, as more states slowly began to reopen amid the pandemic, the nation was shaken by yet another incident that provoked outrage.\nHowever, this incident, unlike a global pandemic, felt familiar -- as the nation had seen such police brutality against black people many times before.\nFloyd, a 46-year-old unarmed black man, was killed at the hand of a Minneapolis police officer, who in a video is seen with his knee on Floyd's neck for over eight minutes.\nA check-cashing business burns during protests in Minneapolis on May 29, 2020.\nThe former officer, Derek Chauvin, was fired, along with three other officers, after outrage increased. Chauvin was charged Friday with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.\nSunday was the sixth day of protests nationwide. Demonstrators funneled their anguish in cities like Atlanta, New York and Washington into chants and signs of Floyd's last few words -- \"I can't breathe.\" While some protests were peaceful, others were marked by chaotic scenes of violence, smashed windows and vehicles set ablaze.\nFive hundred people participated in protests near the Pacific Coast Highway and Main Street in Huntington Beach on Sunday, the Huntington Beach Police Department said.\nThe protest was declared an unlawful assembly after protesters became violent with numerous assaults, and officers observed protesters with weapons such as pepper spray and various impact weapons, the department said.\n\"Multiple weapons including cinder blocks, weights and rocks were located hidden in several of our alleys in the downtown area, indicating a precursor to planned violence,\" police said in a statement.\nHuntington Beach Police said protesters were also blocking traffic on Pacific Coast Highway and refused to leave the area after being asked to do so by officers.\nAs of Sunday night, 17 suspects had been arrested in the city for various charges, police said.\nHuntington Beach joined at least 40 cities in imposing a curfew.

The issue has led Portland city officials and members of the Trump administration to engage in a public war of words over who is to blame for the actions of rioters.\nWheeler was asked whether he is in contact with the acting DHS secretary Wednesday.\n\"I have no reason to reach him,\" Wheeler said at the time. \"My demands are clear. I want them to leave.\"\nBut Acting Secretary for Homeland Security Chad Wolf told Fox News that he blames city leadership for fostering an environment that allows criminals to be untouched.\n\"They're coming armed with rocks, bottles, baseball bats, power tools, commercial grade fireworks, eliciting that violence and targeting their violence on federal courthouses and federal law enforcement officers,\" Wolf said of Portland.\n\"I offered DHS support to help locally address the situation that's going on in Portland, and their only response was: please pack up and go home,\" Wolf said in an interview with Fox News. \"That's just not going to happen on my watch.\"\nFederal officers make 22 arrests since Thursday\nThe US Attorney's Office says officers protecting the federal courthouse in Portland \"have been subjected to nightly threats and assaults from demonstrators while performing their duties.\"\n18 people face federal charges after arrests at courthouse protests in Portland\nCrowds of several hundred people gathered outside the federal courthouse Sunday and \"spent hours yelling, chanting, banging on the fence and throwing objects over it,\" according to a statement released by the Portland Police Bureau early Monday morning.\nFederal officers have arrested 22 people in Portland since Thursday night, according to a press release for the Department of Justice.\nMost of the people arrested have been charged with assaulting a federal officer, but one suspect is accused of illegal operation of a drone.

Not in other cities, but right here in our own Los Angeles.\"\nBonin called on Moore to investigate \"not just individual instances, but of underlying policies and of strategic decisions by the Los Angeles Police Department and other law enforcement agencies.\"\nWhen asked by CNN for comment regarding Bonin's letter on Sunday, a spokesman for the LAPD said, \"We don't have a statement we're putting out on that.\"\nBonin's letter came one day after the Los Angeles chapter of Black Lives Matter and the Los Angeles Community Action Network filed a lawsuit against the city over how LA police have handled protests.\n\"Over the course of approximately a week, the Los Angeles Police Department arrested more than 2,600 individuals engaged in peaceful protest,\" according to the suit obtained by CNN. \"This was not the first time that the LAPD has engaged in these tactics. Over the course of the last several decades, the Defendant City has been sued repeatedly for many of the same tactics on display the past week, including kettling protestors before declaring an unlawful assembly, excessive force with batons and rubber bullets, and prolonged handcuffing and improper conditions of confinement for arrestees.\"\nLAPD Public Information Director Josh Rubenstein told CNN in an email statement Monday that \"the Los Angeles Police Department is not able to comment on pending litigation.\"\n\"However, regarding any mistreatment, violations of Department policy, or excessive use of force; we are reviewing numerous videos, and personal accounts of what happened,\" he said. \"We will investigate thoroughly every allegation, as the treatment of protestors speaks to the heart of the very subject of these demonstrations.\"\nThe Los Angeles City Attorney's office has no comment regarding the suit, spokesman Rob Wilcox told CNN.\nVideos of some encounters between demonstrators and LAPD officials have surfaced online and circulated widely on various social media platforms. Saturday, the LAPD issued a statement to CNN about these viral videos.\n\"Protests, marches and demonstrations over the last several days have been often dynamic and at times dangerous situations for both officers and demonstrators,\" LAPD said in its email. \"A number of these gatherings have unfortunately devolved into chaos with rocks, bottles, and other projectiles being launched at police officers, who have sustained injuries that range from cuts and bruises to a fractured skull.\"\nThe statement goes on to note that the LAPD is \"aware of individuals who have posted videos online and on social media depicting encounters with the police, that they believe constitutes excessive force or misconduct during these demonstrations.\" They said they will \"investigate each instance thoroughly, and hold any officer who violates department policy accountable.\"\nThe LA City Attorney's Office said it will develop new programs focused on the relationship between the community and law enforcement and plans to implement them later this summer.\nIn the city attorney office's news release, Moore issued a statement backing \"this approach to criminal justice reform,\" adding that he will \"work closely with the City Attorney's Office to ensure it is successful.\"\n\"Resolving these violations through alternative methods is a productive and appropriate way to address these offenses, and will have lasting positive effects on our community,\" Moore said in the statement.\nArrests amid peaceful protests\nLAPD officers arrive to arrest protesters for curfew violation after a day of peaceful protest against police brutality. The protests were sparked by the death of George Floyd.\nLos Angeles was among the 40 cities nationwide that imposed a curfew after looting occurred during demonstrations the weekend of May 30.\nIn Santa Monica on May 31, a protest became violent, with police firing rubber bullets and other objects at protesters in an effort to get them to disperse.\nProtesters also threw objects, including slabs of concrete, at police. Stores were also looted.\nElsewhere in LA, rubber bullets were also used, some demonstrators said. \"Insecure\" actor Kendrick Sampson took to social media to share that he was shot seven times with rubber bullets by police during a protest May 30.\n\"He pointed the gun DIRECTLY AT ME,\" Sampson wrote on Twitter, linking to a news report about his experience. \"I actually got hit 7 times with rubber bullets and many with batons. My boy has stitches.\"\nThe Los Angeles Police Department did not respond to CNN's previous request for comment regarding Sampson's social media posts.\nLast week, graphic photos that circulated online showed a man in a wheelchair with a bloodied face, an incident Bonin cited in both his letter and tweets. The man in the image is also referenced in the lawsuit over the city's handling of the protests, where he is identified as Cincinatti.\n\"Cincinatti is disabled and in a wheelchair,\" the suit states. \"He pleaded with police not to use force on him before being shot in the face. But he was not the only disabled person in a wheelchair to be struck in the face by a rubber bullet as the LAPD enforced curfew laws and other misdemeanors in the last week.\"\nIn the lawsuit filed Friday, one demonstrator alleged that he was detained and handcuffed tightly behind his back for about four hours, experiencing numbness, bruising and soreness.\nThe lawsuit also alleges that some unhoused people \"had no place they could go to avoid violating the curfew,\" yet they were \"subjected to excessive force,\" arrested, \"tightly handcuffed\" and taken on buses to Jackie Robinson Stadium on the Veterans Affairs property in West Los Angeles.\nWhen asked about the photo of the man in the wheelchair and allegations of excessive force for those detained, a spokesperson for the LAPD told CNN over the phone: \"We're not making statements on any of those to the fact that they're investigations now and we cannot comment on them.\"\n'We want peace'\nDuring a news conference last Monday, Moore said those protesting by committing criminal acts were not mourning Floyd.\n\"We didn't have people mourning the death of this man, George Floyd -- we had people capitalizing,\" the police chief said June 1. \"His death is on their hands as much as it is those officers.\"\nMoore apologized on Twitter, but many had already expressed their outrage over his comments in replies to the video which was posted on Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti's Twitter page.\n\"I misspoke when making a statement about those engaging in violent acts following the murder of George Floyd,\" he wrote.\nSome demonstrators last week said they wanted \"peace\" with police.\n\"We want peace,\" Joseph Haynes told CNN on June 2. \"We're trying to tell the police, all over the country, if you just march with us you're showing that you're not standing in solidarity for a system that has oppressed people for hundreds of years.\"\nAn LAPD officer chases a suspected looter in an alley behind Hollywood Boulevard on June 1.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) branch in Southern California filed a lawsuit last week on behalf of the Black Lives Matter organization over the curfews in Los Angeles city and county, as well as San Bernardino.\n\"The curfews' extraordinary suppression of all political protest in the evening hours plainly violates the First Amendment to the US Constitution, and their blanket restrictions on movement outside working hours violate the Constitution's protection of freedom of movement,\" the ACLU said in a news release issued June 3.\nGarcetti, Moore and Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva are among the defendants listed in that suit.\nLA County and the city of LA had separate curfews. Both LA County and the Los Angeles mayor lifted the curfew last Thursday. A sheriff's spokesperson told CNN affiliate CBSLA that the decision to lift curfew was not linked to the ACLU lawsuit.\nMayor and police chief garner backlash\nLos Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti has agreed to slash between $100 million and $150 million from the proposed funding for the LAPD.\nAs people continue to voice their concerns over the police department's treatment of protesters, Garcetti has also become the center of backlash.\nGarcetti is the son of former Los Angeles District Attorney Gil Garcetti, who was elected in the aftermath of riots sparked by the 1992 acquittal of four officers charged in the 1991 Rodney King beating. The Rev. Al Sharpton said in 2012 that King's beating \"made America focus on the presence of profiling and police misconduct.\"\nNow the younger Garcetti is a leader amid a similarly tense time for the city.\nIn an interview with CNN's Ana Cabrera on May 30, Garcetti said there are \"absolutely\" lessons to be learned from his father's experiences during that time.\n\"What we learned from that is that we have to actually start to listen to each other,\" he said. \"Law enforcement has to hear the pain of African American men and communities of color ... but secondly, we have to humanize who those people behind the badge are, too.\"\nLast Tuesday, on June 2, protesters gathered outside Garcetti's home.\nA small group of protesters remained there hours after curfew, sitting on the ground with their hands up together, chanting \"peaceful protest,\" CNN reported. Police moved in to arrest some of those still gathered.\nMany Angelenos frustrated by the police department, specifically Moore, dialed in to a Zoom conference hosted by the Los Angeles Police Commission on June 2, the same day protesters rallied outside of Garcetti's home.\n\"Listen to the people of Los Angeles, they're not going to take it anymore,\" one caller said to Moore. \"You are all guilty if you don't figure this out. ... Send the National Guard home. We don't need protection, we need protection from you.\"\n\"Chief Moore is morally obligated to resign,\" another caller said. \"All your cute Zoom background photos of the city won't trick us into thinking you care about anyone but yourselves and what's in your pockets.\"\n\"Black lives matter, act like it. Happy Tuesday,\" the same caller said in his remarks, a clip of which has garnered more than 170,000 retweets on Twitter.\nThe meeting lasted about seven hours.\nAngelenos continue to protest\nProtesters march past LAPD officers in downtown Los Angeles on Saturday during a demonstration over the death of George Floyd while in Minneapolis police custody.\nSunday marked nearly two weeks of protests across the US, including in multiple areas of Los Angeles. About 20,000 people showed up to one demonstration in Hollywood, according to CNN affiliate KTLA.\nSome protesters in LA said the mood felt more peaceful this weekend.\nNaomi Trantu, a Los Angeles resident, told CNN on Friday that she has seen less of a police presence since the protests began.\nIn earlier days, \"the police were agitated,\" she said. \"Every day, there's been fewer police. I think the more peaceful energy is because of that. There's been no shift in intention. Empowerment was always there.\"\nGarcetti on Sunday afternoon announced the California National Guard units will leave the city \"this evening.\"\nThere's a growing call to defund the police. Here's what it means\nHe wrote in a tweet: \"I'm proud L.A. residents are leading a peaceful and powerful movement to build a fair, just, and equitable city.\"\nGarcetti also agreed Wednesday to slash between $100 million and $150 million from the proposed funding for the LAPD after Californians decried a proposal to increase its budget to $1.86 billion.\nThe People's Budget LA Coalition called Garcetti's pledge \"a start,\" noting that cutting $150 million from LAPD would \"still leave LAPD with 51% of the city's unrestricted revenues.\"\n\"We're encouraged to see that our constant action has pushed Mayor Garcetti and City Council to back up their nice words with some actual action, however small, that directly confronts the racist police state that is the City of Los Angeles,\" said Melina Abdullah, one of the leaders of Black Lives Matter Los Angeles, in a statement.\n\"But they need to go much further.\"\nCNN's Kyung Lah, Alexandra Meeks, Sarah Moon, Cheri Mossburg, Joe Sutton, Scottie Andrew and Jason Kravarik contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/23/us/rayshard-brooks-funeral/index.html", "headline": "Rayshard Brooks remembered as a hard-working father kept down by a racist legal system", "published_date": "2020-06-23", "text": "(CNN)Rayshard Brooks was remembered at his funeral Tuesday as a smiling, oft-dancing, hard-working father brought down by a racist legal system of imprisonment, probation and police violence.\nA private funeral service was held in Atlanta at historic Ebenezer Baptist Church, where the Rev.

You know, lock us away.\"\nRayshard Brooks opened up about the struggles of life after incarceration in an interview before his death\nBrooks told the interviewer he was arrested for false imprisonment and financial credit card fraud. He said his public defender told him he could get 10 years, so he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to a year in prison.\n\"I'm like, 'oh my God, I have kids out here' ... so I'm trying to do the best option I can to be back to society,\" he said.\nNationwide, 4.5 million people are on probation or parole, and African-Americans make up 30 percent of those on community supervision.\nAs part of a plea deal, Brooks pleaded guilty in 2014 to charges of false imprisonment, simple battery/family, simple battery and felony cruelty/cruelty to children, and he was sentenced to one year in prison and six years on probation, according to court records.

Warnock said that the video of Brooks' comments was heartbreaking.\n\"He talks about how hard it is to come back, to recover when you return. He was trying. He had been digging his way back.

During the fight, Brooks took one of the officers' Tasers, according to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.\nVideo of the incident shows him running away, and he appears to turn and point the Taser in the direction of one of the officers. The officer, Rolfe, then fired his handgun three times, striking Brooks twice in the back and also hitting a nearby occupied vehicle.\nRolfe was fired and Brosnan was placed on administrative duty\nFulton County District Attorney Paul Howard charged Rolfe with felony murder and 10 other accounts and charged Brosnan with aggravated assault for allegedly standing on Brooks' shoulders as he lay dying.\nRolfe's attorneys said that he fired the fatal shots \"fearing for his safety and the safety of the civilians around him.\" Brosnan said that he suffered a concussion during the fight and that he stepped on Brooks for a short period of time in the immediate, disorienting aftermath of the shooting.\nCNN's Lindsay Benson, Chuck Johnston, Randi Kaye, Pamela Kirkland, Jamiel Lynch, Laura Robinson, Devon Sayers and Nick Valencia contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/02/us/nyc-democrats-donate-police-money-trnd/index.html", "headline": "A 19-year-old called out New York Democrats accepting police campaign donations.

Then (the death of) George Floyd happened -- so many people responded and it got, like, a hundred likes in a couple hours? So people wanted to see this.\"\nSince sharing his \"Who's Taking Cop Money?\" Google spreadsheet on Twitter on May 29, eight Democrats -- including a state senator, state assembly members and New York councilmembers -- have vowed to donate their police-funded contributions to bail funds or criminal justice reform organizations. Fernando said he requires these elected officials to send him proof of their reallocated money before updating his spreadsheet.\n\"Your contributors are a reflection of who you are,\" he said. \"I think it's fair to ask politicians to take money that aligns with the values they espouse. If you're going to fight to end solitary confinement in New York, you shouldn't be taking money from corrections officers.\"\nNew York Democratic officials respond\nAmong the most notable politicians to reallocate their campaign donations is New York State Sen. Michael Gianaris, who says he donated $16,650 in contributions to bail funds and mutual aid after Fernando's spreadsheet made the rounds.\n\"I thought this was an important thing to do,\" Gianaris said. \"Others can decide for themselves. We're held accountable by the people we represent. I'm the deputy majority leader and highest-ranking senator from New York City, so I have a special obligation to take a stand, given what happened and what we continue to see on the streets every day.\"\nGianaris said even though the decision wasn't a reflection on police officers on the whole, he's received threats from police saying they will not respond to 911 calls if he should ever need to make one.\n\"It's outrageous to suggest someone's public safety should be put in danger,\" he said. \"We're not in a political alliance with law enforcement. That mentality highlights that we have a systemic problem.\"\nCatalina Cruz, a New York state assemblywoman, said it was a mistake to take the money and that she is giving it to bail funds.\n\"Nobody questioned where I stood, but it was me proactively saying no one should question where I stood,\" she said. \"I'm not going to allow anyone to question where I stand -- not even going to give it a chance. I said, 'Let's give back the money.'\"\nOthers, such as Assemblywoman Karines Reyes, said she hadn't even realized she had taken police contributions.\n\"The contributions don't necessarily come from police officers,\" Reyes said. \"They come from an organization whose sole purpose is to protect police officers even when they're in the wrong -- oftentimes when they are in the wrong. And that is counterintuitive to accountability. There is no profession where you can kill somebody without being accountable.\"\nReyes said her constituents made clear that they didn't want their representatives taking police money anymore, which Fernando said he \"never thought\" would happen when he first made the spreadsheet.\n\"I couldn't do anything without those people on the street,\" he said. \"Without those protests, it wouldn't have had the momentum to take notice.\n\"Black Lives Matter was in the back of (politicians') minds and now it's pushed to the front,\" he said. \"That's the way I see it.\""}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/24/us/five-things-june-24-trnd/index.html", "headline": "5 things to know for June 24: Coronavirus, Justice Department, NASCAR, Mexico, Canada", "published_date": "2020-06-24", "text": "Get '5 Things' in your inbox\nIf your day doesn't start until you're up to speed on the latest headlines, then let us introduce you to your new favorite morning fix.

Coronavirus\nSome alarming Covid-19 trends are emerging across several US states, and officials are desperately pleading with people to stay home, wear masks and keep their distance. California, Florida and Arizona are reporting thousands of new cases each day. And in Texas, health authorities have said new cases and hospitalizations are rising at their fastest rate yet. These are among 26 states -- a number also on the rise -- seeing new cases increase compared with the prior week. Despite warnings that Black Lives Matter protests across the country could lead to a jump in cases, new research suggests that's not happening. Instead, the latest surges stem from the number of places in the country that reopened too soon and too quickly. It's a stark contrast with other parts of the world. The situation in the US is so bad that European Union nations are discussing a recommendation to block American travelers.\nEU considers blocking US travelers due to Covid-19 surge 02:24\n2. Justice Department\nTwo Justice Department prosecutors will testify before the House Judiciary Committee today, accusing Attorney General William Barr and senior department officials of politicizing investigations. Aaron Zelinsky, a prosecutor on former special counsel Robert Mueller's team, plans to testify that the sentencing recommendation for Trump's longtime friend and adviser Roger Stone was watered down due to political pressure from the \"highest levels\" of DOJ, according to his prepared remarks. John Elias, a career prosecutor in the Antitrust Division, accused Barr of ordering investigations into 10 mergers of cannabis companies because he did not like the industry, according to a copy of his testimony. Their criticism comes just days after Barr's decision to fire Geoffrey Berman, the US attorney for the Southern District of New York, which has investigated Trump and his associates.\nBerman to CNN: I'm just here to do my job 02:40\n3.

NASCAR, mentioning the FBI report, described the item as a \"garage door pull rope fashioned like a noose.\" Wallace, the only Black driver in NASCAR's top circuit, said he's upset some in the public are now questioning his integrity. \"Whether tied in 2019 or whatever, it was a noose,\" he said. \"So, it wasn't directed at me but somebody tied a noose.

Mexico\nA 7.4-magnitude earthquake hit Mexico's southern Oaxaca region yesterday, killing at least five people. The earthquake stuck around 10:30 a.m. local time, with an epicenter 6.8 miles southwest of Santa Mar\u00eda Zapotitl\u00e1n, near El Coyul. It collapsed buildings and prompted evacuations, even damaging hospitals that had been dealing with coronavirus patients. The quake could be felt as far as Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. Tremors were also felt in the capital Mexico City, more than 200 miles away. The US Geological Survey said the damage in Oaxaca state is considered light to moderate -- relatively good news considering that Mexico is one of the world's most seismically active regions and has a long history of devastating earthquakes.\n5. Canada\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is calling China's decision to charge two of his country's citizens with espionage clearly political. Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor were officially charged this week with spying and handling state secrets. The two men have been detained in China since 2018, in the weeks following the arrest in Vancouver of Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of the Chinese technology company Huawei, on charges filed in the US. Trudeau is now under pressure to do something about the case of the \"two Michaels,\" possibly including facilitating a prisoner swap.

There are 17,894 cases in Oklahoma and 452 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University's tally of cases in the United States.\nWhen asked if the cases in Tulsa are going up due to the rally on June 20, Dart said that there were several large events a little over two weeks ago.\n\"I guess we just connect the dots,\" Dart said.\nIn a statement to CNN, Leanne Stephens of the Tulsa Health Department said, \"Our epidemiologists and contact tracers are inundated with following up with Tulsa County residents who are confirmed positive as the numbers have been extremely high in recent days.

The incubation period is about three to 14 days, with symptoms typically appearing \"within four or five days after exposure,\" according to Harvard Medical School.\nTrump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh told CNN, \"There were literally no health precautions to speak of as thousands looted, rioted, and protested in the streets and the media reported that it did not lead to a rise in coronavirus cases. Meanwhile, the President's rally was 18 days ago, all attendees had their temperature checked, everyone was provided a mask, and there was plenty of hand sanitizer available for all. It's obvious that the media's concern about large gatherings begins and ends with Trump rallies.\"\nWhy temperature checks aren't very helpful in preventing Covid-19\nMurtaugh provided a link to CNN reporting on research suggesting that Black Lives Matter protests across the country did not lead to a jump in coronavirus cases.\nAll of Trump's campaign staffers who attended his rally went into quarantine, however, after interacting with several colleagues who later tested positive for the virus. Multiple Secret Service officers were also instructed to self-quarantine after two of their colleagues who were on site for the rally tested positive.\nAbout 6,200 people attended the rally, according to the Tulsa Fire Department.\nThe problem with Trump's pandemic-era events\nTulsa Mayor G.T. Bynum said the rally, along with the large \"serious seven\" events -- which the state has identified as weddings, religious events and other large-scale gatherings -- informed an executive order that goes into effect tomorrow requiring events with more than 500 people to receive guidance from the health department to evaluate safety plans.\nEvent organizers and health officials will work on a case-by-case bases to make safe decisions in relation to the event, according to the executive order.\nWhile hospital capacity is fine right now, Bynum said that this week he \"finally started to hear some concern, not about where things stand today, but where things could look if we continue on this trajectory unchecked.\"\nBynum said that ordering masks for employees at bars and restaurants has helped the Tulsa Health Department with their contact tracing by showing them what the leading contributors are to cases in the Tulsa area.\nThere is no city-wide mandate for face coverings, although Bynum and Dart encourage everyone to wear a mask in public.\n\"I think that the thing that citizens need to understand is that when we put that kind of mandate in place, we will be putting it there because we had no other choice but to do that to protect their ability to get medical care over the long term of this pandemic,\" Bynum said when asked why the city hasn't put in a mask mandate.\nCNN's Holly Yan, Ryan Nobles and Kaitlan Collins contributed to this story."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/30/us/pelicans-jazz-blm-tribute-nba-spt-trnd/index.html", "headline": "NBA players took a knee before kicking off the league's reopened season", "published_date": "2020-07-30", "text": "(CNN)Every NBA player who restarted the NBA's season on Thursday kneeled during the National Anthem, wearing \"Black Lives Matter\" shirts.\nMoments before tipoff on Thursday evening, players with the New Orleans Pelicans and the Utah Jazz, joined by coaches and game officials, all took a knee.\nThe Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Clippers followed suit ahead of their game in Orlando.\nOn some game jerseys, players' names were replaced with messages, such as \"Equality,\" \"I am a man,\" \"Ally,\" and \"Say her name,\" sending a clear message in support of the social justice movement.\nAfter the moment, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said he will not force players to stand during the anthem.\nLos Angeles Lakers players kneeled during the national anthem before the game against the LA Clippers.\n\"I respect our teams' unified act of peaceful protest for social justice and under these unique circumstances will not enforce our long-standing rule requiring standing during the playing of our national anthem.\"\nThe New Orleans Pelicans, in a statement, said the team stands by the \"ideals of freedom of speech and the right to peacefully protest.\"\n\"Collectively with the Utah Jazz, our organization joins the NBA in supporting our players and coaches.

Outside of basketball, many MLB players also took a knee as their season resumed earlier this month.\nAll of these demonstrations come amid unrest in the US over the deaths of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and George Floyd, and mirror that of Colin Kaepernick during the 2016-17 NFL season.\nThe deaths have caused ongoing protests throughout the country, and resulted in calls for racial equality, social justice and police reform in the US, among other demands.\nCoronavirus protections\nThe NBA returned after a 20-week hiatus to a so-called bubble, in Orlando, Florida.\nAmid the pandemic, the league took precautions Thursday to protect against coronavirus. The scorer's table was surrounded by acrylic glass dividers, for example.\nTeam benches also consisted of multiple rows of seats -- with appropriate distance between each seat -- and were divided into three sections: players; coaches and team staff.\nDuring any timeout or period break, players and coaches could still huddle like normal, but they had to sit in or congregate around movable chairs apart from the team benches. The chairs used during timeouts or period breaks were cleaned and disinfected after each use.\nThe Los Angeles Lakers and the Los Angeles Clippers took their game down to the wire on Thursday -- just like the Utah Jazz and New Orleans Pelicans did earlier in the night.\nLeBron James was clutch at the end. First, he scored what turned out to be the game-winning shot by getting the offensive rebound on his own missed shot and laying it in. On the other end of the floor, he defended the Clippers two stars, Kawhi Leonard and then Paul George, to deny the Clippers from scoring. The Lakers would win, 103-101.\nThe league shut down on March 11 when -- just moments before the Utah Jazz were to take on the Thunder in Oklahoma City -- it was learned that Jazz center Rudy Gobert had tested positive for Covid-19.\nOn Thursday night, when play resumed, it was fitting that Gobert scored the first basket in a layup and hit what would be the game-winning free throws, in Utah's 106-104 win against the Pelicans.\n\"Life works in mysterious ways,\" Gobert said. \"I'm just happy, blessed to be able to be back on the court, to do what I love to do, to be back out there with my teammates and try to win a game.\""}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/26/us/teens-rename-john-lewis-high-school/index.html", "headline": "Virginia teens got in 'good trouble,' as they pushed to rename their high school for John Lewis", "published_date": "2020-07-26", "text": "Washington, D.C. (CNN)Students at Robert E. Lee High School in Fairfax County, Virginia, got in really \"good trouble\" after pushing to rename their high school in honor of late US Rep. John R. Lewis.\nThey felt that the school's name did not appropriately reflect its mission, nor the diversity of its current student body. And after a student-led drive for change, the Fairfax County School Board voted on Thursday to rename the school after the civil rights icon.\nLuna Alazar, a senior at the time, spoke up at the first school board meeting on the subject this fall. She is now 18 years old.\n\"I would like if you imagine being a Lee High School student. We are a tremendously diverse community with strong ambitions and remarkable unity. We are charismatic and full of pride. We have different ideas and imaginations that make us truly unique. However, we are named after someone who doesn't represent us at all,\" she told the Fairfax County School Board in October 2019.\nThe school's student body is largely made up of minorities -- 45.46% Hispanic or Latino, 23.94% Asian, 14.93% White and 12.97% Black, according to the county's website.\n\"It's kind of like a slap in the face to say that we go to Robert E.

Lee -- others were adamant that changing the name would erase years of Virginian history and Lee's heritage.\nShe said she felt hopeless after that winter meeting. Many older community members who opposed the name change told her she was just a student, without experience or knowledge.\n\"Why should we listen to you?\" they asked.\nThe effort to rename the school, however, was reignited in recent months, inspired by the current national reckoning on racial justice.\nIn June, during a virtual meeting of the school board, many students, including Alazar and juniors Amanda Hurst and Nour Kassem, stressed that they are the current face of the school and that they have to deal with the ramifications of the school's name every day.\n\"It feels very ungenuine for all of us to say, 'Black Lives Matter,' if our school's name is Robert E. Lee and we haven't tried to change the name,\" Hurst, 16, said in an interview, speaking to the reason many students spoke up en mass this summer.\nFollowing community-wide pleas for change, the school board announced it would hold a one-month period of public comment on possible new names. Name suggestions included Mildred Loving and Cesar Chavez.\nAt the end of that period, the school board voted unanimously to rename the school after Lewis.\n'Good Trouble' in action\nLewis, a champion for civil rights, famously inspired young people to stand up for what they believe in.\nWhen asked about Lewis's legacy and how they will honor his commitment to civil rights, Fairfax County students shared that, in part, they have already embodied 'good trouble' by fighting to rename their school.\nWith plans to create a social justice committee, and discussions around revising the school's curriculum to be more representative of their diversity, these students will continue to speak up for change in their community.\nEdward Cari\u00f1o, 15\n\"We are using our voices to ruffle people's feathers in order to make some good change, because in order to make change, I mean, some people are going to be opposed to it obviously... (we're) using our voices to advocate for what's right.\"\nLuna Alazar, 18\n\"I still stood up and I still fought, even though many people were against me or didn't care about what I had to say. And I think that's 'good trouble' because you're fighting for a cause that means more to you than it does to many... it supports many that have been so lost. So many students at my school who feel like they aren't supported, felt supported after this name change. They felt that they were heard because before they didn't feel like they had a voice, but now they know they do.\"\nFarva Khan, 16\nFarva Khan\n\"We're planning on starting a new committee for our class at John Lewis called the social justice committee to highlight students' civic engagement and activities and opportunities because John Lewis was an advocate for young voices, and we believe it's the best way to honor him.

We have a lot. From everything going on right now, we did notice that our community needs more awareness. A big issue right now is racial injustice. The school's named after John Lewis. It's very important for them to know what he did in terms of fighting against racism.\"\nAmanda Hurst, 16\nAmanda Hurst\n\"We think (Fairfax County Public School's) curriculum is very White-washed and very Eurocentric...

I feel like that kind of represents 'good trouble' in a way, where you're causing trouble to show light on something...

These cities, including Atlanta, New York City, Chicago and Los Angeles, are also seeing a significant decline in other violent and property crimes.\nThere's a rise in shootings but a drop in other crime\nAtlanta Police publishes data on its site weekly of eight serious crimes: murders, rapes, robberies, burglaries, aggravated assaults, larcenies from automobiles, other larcenies and automobile thefts.\nAs of June 27, the latest date for which Atlanta crime data is available, there were 50 murders in Atlanta compared to 46 at this point in 2019, and 41 murders at this point in 2018.\nThis year's murder total so far is slightly below the 55 murders as of the end of June 2016, when cities across the country saw Black Lives Matter protests against police violence spurred by the killings of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile.\nCiting violent crime in Atlanta, Georgia governor declares state of emergency and calls up National Guard\nIn addition, the 282 shooting incidents so far in 2020 in Atlanta is a 19% increase from that point last year, the data shows.\nThe increase is even more stark over the past 28 days compared to the same 28-day period in 2019, as murders in Atlanta have jumped from six to 14 and shootings incidents have nearly doubled.\nBut at the same time, reported robberies, burglaries, larcenies from automobiles, other larcenies, and automobile thefts have declined by at least 14% compared to this same point in 2019 as well as this point in 2018. Aggravated assaults are unchanged from last year's total as of June 27, while reported rapes are down 59%.\nIn all, the total number of serious criminal incidents so far this year is far lower than in previous years.\nAs of June 27 in Atlanta, there have been about 9,500 incidents of those eight most serious offenses -- an 18% decrease from the same point in 2019 and a 22% decrease from the same point in 2018.\nSimilarly, as of the end of June, there were about 12,400 of these eight serious offenses in 2018, 12,200 in 2017, and 13,600 in 2016, according to Atlanta Police data. And all of these totals are well below crime numbers as of the end of June 2009, when there were 18,900 of these incidents.\nIn all, the data is broadly consistent with the nationwide decline in violent crime over the past several decades since its peak in the early 1990s.\nWhy are large cities seeing similar trends?\nThis trend is not specific to Atlanta, as New York City has similarly seen a rise in shootings and murders this year but a decline in most other crimes. New York Police Department officials have blamed the increases on the coronavirus pandemic and protests against police brutality, as well as issues specific to New York like state bail reform and a decline in incarceration at Rikers Island jail.\nGun violence surges in major American cities in the midst of a pandemic and a policing crisis\nCriminologists are still trying to understand why so many American cities have seen similar trends. A report commissioned by the Arnold Ventures philanthropy said homicide rates declined in April and May in most large US cities likely because of coronavirus business closures and stay-at-home orders.\n\"Homicides depend on relatively vibrant activity patterns -- lots of people on the street,\" Richard Rosenfeld, a University of Missouri-St. Louis professor and co-author of the report, told the philanthropy's newsletter. \"When the streets are empty, the opportunities for all kinds of street crime go down.\"\nThomas Abt, a senior fellow at the Council on Criminal Justice and the report's other author, told CNN last week that there appeared to be connection between violence and the \"legitimacy\" of the state and law enforcement.\n\"As legitimacy drops, the people in these communities simply don't use the criminal justice system to mediate conflicts and instead turn to violence,\" he told the newsletter.\n\"We saw a significant increase in homicides after the unrest in Ferguson, Baltimore, Chicago and other places. We may be in for the same thing in the wake of the George Floyd protests.\"\nCNN's Chris Boyette, Ray Sanchez, Brynn Gingras, Kate Conerly and Laura Dolan contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/15/us/rayshard-brooks-widow-tomika-miller-interview/index.html", "headline": "Rayshard Brooks' widow: 'Do they feel sorry for what they took away?'", "published_date": "2020-06-15", "text": "Atlanta (CNN)Of all the things still unclear about the night Rayshard Brooks was shot to death by Atlanta police, there's one thing his widow wants to know from the officers involved.\n\"Do they feel sorry for what they took away?\" Tomika Miller wondered through tears in an interview with CNN. \"If they had the chance to do it again, would they do it the same way or would they do it totally different?\"\nBrooks, 27, was shot dead by an officer Friday night at a fast-food restaurant after he scuffled with police who were trying to handcuff him, took one of their Tasers and ran. Brooks was suspected of driving under the influence.\nRayshard Brooks' final moments were caught on video. Here's what the footage shows\nStill, Miller said she's not angry about how officers treated her husband, including how long it took to attend to him after he was shot, because \"God will deal with that.\"\n\"I know my husband would never want me to be upset with them or hold that on my heart,\" she said. \"He was a very forgiving person.\"\nMiller said she hasn't seen any video footage of her husband's death, and won't turn on the television or radio, saying she won't look at the video until \"I lay my husband to rest, or maybe a year from now.\"\nBrooks was shot twice in the back, according to an autopsy report.\nGarrett Rolfe, the officer who killed Brooks, was terminated Saturday, and Atlanta Police Chief Erika Shields resigned.\nFulton County District Attorney Paul Howard told CNN on Sunday a decision on charges against the officer will be made \"sometime around Wednesday.\"\n\"(Brooks) did not seem to present any threat to anyone. The fact that it would escalate to his death seems unreasonable,\" Howard said.\nThere are three charges under consideration, according to the DA: murder, felony murder and voluntary manslaughter.\nThe knock on the door\nMiller said she last saw her husband at 4 p.m. Friday. The family had gone bowling and had \"had a blast\" that day, she told CNN. Miller said she was tired and went home to wind down.\nWhen the knock on her door came later, she assumed it was Brooks, but it was a Georgia Bureau of Investigation agent.\nMiller thought the agent maybe had the wrong door, she said. She wasn't thinking, she said, that they were about to ask her to identify him.\n'How many more protests will it take?' Relatives grieve the death of Rayshard Brooks, another black man killed by police\nThe agent asked to show her a picture.\n\"I knew it was my husband, and I wasn't going to see him again,\" Miller said.\n\"I wish I could apologize for not being with him. I feel so guilty,\" Millier said, crying. \"I know he wanted me to stay with him. I was just so tired that day.\"\nA loving father and husband\nMiller had to tell the children that their father wouldn't be coming home. She told them \"he's in a better place,\" trying to keep it positive and keep her tears to herself.\nMiller painted a picture of a loving father who couldn't deny his children, especially the three girls, anything.\n\"They got him wrapped around their fingers,\" she said. \"There's nothing they can't have ... even when I'm saying, hey, stop, don't give them that, they don't need that.\"\nTheir son, a teenager, has shut down since his father's death.\nWhat Georgia law says about when police can use deadly force\n\"He's numb,\" she said. \"He's not ready to talk about it.\"\n\"I don't think he thinks it could have happened to someone so close,\" that it's not just on television, Miller said.\nThe couple's relationship, she said, was a \"friendship no one could break.\"\nBrooks was a happy person and \"always kept my spirits up,\" she said, adding he \"pushed me to be better\" and to \"grow into the woman I am today.\"\nProtests\nMiller said she's thankful for the protests but called on those taking part to remain peaceful. Destroying things is not going to help and that it only \"makes us look like savages,\" she said.\nThe Wendy's where the shooting took place was set on fire Saturday night, and protesters marched onto a nearby interstate and shut it down.\nThere needs to be more community dialogue between people and the police officers sworn to protect them, Miller said. She wants change through communication, not aggression.\n\"When you protest and do it out of love, strength and good courage, it works,\" she said. \"It works.\"\nBrooks, she said, was sacrificed so that people will see black lives matter.\n\"I hate that it was my husband whose life was sacrificed,\" Miller said, \"but we have to stand up for our people.\"\nCNN's Maria Cartaya contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/30/us/minnesota-police-actions-public-anger-trnd/index.html", "headline": "George Floyd killing latest in string of police actions to stoke public anger in Minnesota", "published_date": "2020-05-30", "text": "(CNN)The Minneapolis police officer is seen in the video pressing his knee on the back of the handcuffed 46-year-old man. \"Please, I can't breathe,\" George Floyd says.\nAfter about six minutes on Monday evening, Floyd lay motionless, his eyes shut, his head against the pavement.

Ruszczyk was months away from her wedding.\nNoor was fired and charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. He testified at trial that his partner's terrified expression and the sight of Ruszczyk with her hand raised jolted him into action.\nAlthough he did not see a gun in the woman's hand, Noor said he feared his partner might be shot.\nFormer Minneapolis Police Officer Mohamed Noor\nNoor, a 33-year-old Somali-American, was convicted on of third-degree murder and manslaughter in 2019. In June, a Minnesota judge sentenced him to 12\u00bd years in prison.

Another officer approached but remained farther away on the passenger side.\nCatile's girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, and her 4-year-old daughter were passengers.\nYanez asked for Castile's driver's license and insurance. Thirty seconds into the encounter, Castile told Yanez that he has a weapon.\nPhilando Castile\nThe officer told Castile not to reach for the gun. They exchanged a few words. Seconds later, Yanez pulled his weapon and fired seven rapid shots into the car, striking Castile five times.\nThe child exited the car and the other officer picked her up. Reynolds began sharing a live video on Facebook.\nHer Livestream captured Yanez yelling, \"I told him not to reach for it!\" and a bleeding Castile saying, \"I wasn't reaching.\" Castile's fully loaded gun was found in his shorts pocket after his death.\nCastile's death garnered widespread attention -- and sparked nationwide protests over the use of force by police -- after his girlfriend's video went public.\nYanez was acquitted in June 2017 of one count of second-degree manslaughter and two counts of intentional discharge of a firearm that endangers safety. He testified that he feared for his life and believed Castile was pulling his own gun from his pocket. But prosecutors said Yanez was too quick to pull the trigger.\nMembers of the Castile family screamed profanities and cried when the verdict was announced.\nThe St. Anthony Police Department announced Yanez would no longer be with the police force.\nCastile's family reached a $3 million settlement with the city of St. Anthony in 2017.\nJamar Clark\nJamar Clark, 24, was shot and killed by Minneapolis police during a scuffle on November 15, 2015.\nJamar Clark, a 24-year-old African American, was shot during a scuffle with white Minneapolis police officers in front of an apartment building during the early hours of November 15, 2015.\nThe shooting sparked weeks of protests, including an 18-day sit-in at a police station in the city's north end. The Black Lives Matter movement and other groups drew national attention to the shooting.\nThe protests were largely peaceful, but turned violent when counter-protesters shot and injured activists occupying the police station. Three white men were arrested. The shooter, Allen \"Lance\" Scarsella, was convicted in 2017 of 12 felony counts, ranging from assault to rioting, and sentenced to 15 years in prison, WCCO reported. Two other men pleaded guilty to lesser charges and received sentence of probation and some jail time.\nUnrest mounts across multiple US cities over the death of George Floyd\nIn 2016, a police internal investigation concluded the two officers involved in the Clark shooting did not violate department policies and would not face discipline.\nThe officers, Mark Ringgenberg and Dustin Schwarze, were cleared to leave desk duty and resume policing.\nThe US Justice Department declined to prosecute the officers, saying it found \"insufficient evidence\" for criminal civil rights charges. Minnesota's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) concluded the officers acted in self-defense and would not face criminal charges.\nSchwarze shot Clark only after Ringgenberg scuffled with the young man, according to the BCA findings. Clark allegedly took control of the officer's gun and Ringgenberg told Schwarze to open fire.\nClark died at a hospital one day after being shot.\nPolice reports and subsequent investigations said Clark had attacked his girlfriend the day of the shooting. Clark also interfered with paramedics attempting to transport her to the hospital and refused officers' demands to remove his hands from his pockets, according to Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman, who announced charges Friday in connection with Floyd's death.\nTerence Franklin\nOn May 10, 2013, Terence Franklin, 22, was shot to death by members of a Minneapolis police SWAT team in the basement of a Minneapolis house, according to MPD 150, a collective of researchers, artists and activists who want the city police department dissolved.\nFranklin was suspected of burglarizing a home, MPD 150 and WCCO reported.\nWhat protesters say is fueling their anger\nPolice said he was shot and killed after a struggling with SWAT officers and wounding two of them, the station reported.\nIn the basement, police said Franklyn broke away from an officer, grabbed a police submachine gun and shot two officers in the legs, MPD 150 reported. Two other officers fatally shot Franklyn.\nThe death led to months of protests, according to WCCO. A grand jury cleared the officers of any wrongdoing.\nIn 2014, Franklin's family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the city and the police, WCCO reported.\nThe family claimed the police's actions that day were racially motivated and excessive, according to the station. The lawsuit said Franklin was shot after putting up his hands and surrendering.\nIn February, the Minneapolis City Council settled the federal lawsuit with Franklin's family for $795,000, WCCO reported."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/04/us/mcmichaels-hearing-ahmaud-arbery/index.html", "headline": "Ahmaud Arbery was hit with a truck before he died, and his killer allegedly used a racial slur, investigator testifies", "published_date": "2020-06-04", "text": "(CNN)William Bryan told investigators he heard Travis McMichael use a racial epithet after fatally shooting Ahmaud Arbery in Glynn County, a Georgia Bureau of Investigation agent testified Thursday at a preliminary hearing.\nBryan told police Travis McMichael said \"f***ing n***er\" after three blasts from his shotgun left Arbery dead in the street in the Satilla Shores neighborhood in February, GBI Assistant Special Agent in Charge Richard Dial testified.

Dial did not say to whom McMichael was referring and was not asked for more context.\nBryan, too, had several messages on his phone that included \"racial\" terms and indicated he may have prejudged Arbery when he saw him that day, Dial said.\n\"There's evidence of Mr. Bryan's racist attitude in his communications, and from that I extrapolate the reason why he made assumptions he did that day,\" he said. \"He saw a man running down the road with a truck following him, and I believe he made certain assumptions that were, at least in part, based upon his racial bias.\"\nArbery's mother, Wanda Cooper, was devastated when she heard Dial's testimony, she said.\n\"I often imagine the last minutes of my son's life.

That is when he struck Arbery, Dial said, and Arbery kept running with the McMichaels in pursuit.\nBryan turned around, and that is when the widely disseminated video of Arbery's killing begins, he said.\nWhen police arrived after the shooting, Dial said, Gregory McMichael said in remarks caught on police body camera footage that he didn't know for certain if Arbery had stolen anything.\n\"He had a gut feeling that Mr. Arbery may have been responsible for thefts that were in the neighborhood previously.

Coronavirus\nThere are now more than 2 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the US, and health experts have issued a new and bleak prediction: Following widespread reopenings, another 100,000 people in the US will die of the disease by September, pushing the death toll to well above 200,000. While infection numbers and hospitalizations are going up in some states, health officials in Missouri are looking into an unusual case. Two hairstylists there who worked while they had coronavirus symptoms did not infect the 140 clients they served in mid-May. County health officials called the result encouraging and said they're looking into the case for insight on how to stop the virus' spread.\nGov. Cuomo: We've been through hell.

Black Lives Matter\nNASCAR has banned Confederate flags from all its races and events after African American driver Bubba Wallace called on the racing body to crack down on fans using the symbol. It's the latest move by a major brand amid protests for racial justice. US Soccer also repealed a policy requiring players to stand during the National Anthem, and some US military leaders are considering renaming bases that honor Confederate commanders. Around the country, statues of Christopher Columbus and other problematic historical figures are coming down. On the legislative side, the Trump administration is reportedly mulling an executive order on police reform, though it's unclear what it may contain. And in a case many activists say has gone under the radar during recent protests, the detective who applied for the warrant that ended in the March shooting death of Breonna Taylor has been placed on administrative reassignment.\nNASCAR driver to race with Black Lives Matter themed car 01:18\n3. Immigration\nA new Trump administration proposal would make it harder for migrants to claim asylum in the US. An asylum claim could face greater scrutiny if the person traveled through at least one country on the way to the US but didn't seek refuge there. It would also punish people who lived unlawfully in the US for a long time before applying for asylum. Though the latest rules don't mention the coronavirus, the past few months have seen more than a dozen changes to the immigration system tied to the pandemic: Immigration hearings have been postponed, refugee admissions have been put on pause and migrants have largely been barred from entering the US. In fact, the American Civil Liberties Union just filed a lawsuit against some of these stringent border restrictions.\nLawyer defending Trump policy makes stunning admission (March) 04:49\n4. Election 2020\nAfter Georgia's disastrous primary, election officials across the US are getting more concerned about the fall presidential contest. Besides long lines and technical problems, polling places in some counties changed at the last minute as some sites pulled out due to coronavirus concerns. Georgia voters also had trouble with mail-in ballots that had confusing instructions. All in all, the state was overwhelmed with nearly 1.6 million absentee ballot applications and struggled to process them all. This may be a worrying sign that other states new to mail-in voting could face similar challenges as they ramp up for November.\nPelosi claims Georgia voting issues could be 'by design' 04:29\n5.

In Washington, DC, police released tear gas and fired rubber bullets at protesters near the White House to make way for President Trump to pose outside of a nearby church while holding a bible. His photo opportunity sent ripples of disbelief through the faith community. In New York City, widespread looting in upscale neighborhoods amounted to what one CNN correspondent called \"anarchy.\" Los Angeles and New York City have both imposed the harshest curfews the cities have seen in decades. Meanwhile, the demonstrations have gone global. People gathered in London, Amsterdam, Berlin, Rio de Janeiro and other cities in a show of solidarity with Black Lives Matter activists.\nCuomo reacts to Trump holding Bible for photo-op: Open it! 04:11\n2. Military \nDeclaring himself the \"president of law and order,\" President Trump has vowed to return order to American streets using the military if widespread protests continue. During a speech yesterday, the President said he would invoke the Insurrection Act, an 1807 law that allows a president to deploy the US military to suppress civil disorder. Some military leaders have expressed concern over his vow, saying it sets a dangerous precedent. More than 17,000 members of the National Guard are already standing ready to support local law enforcement across 23 states and Washington, DC. The Trump Administration also tapped 200 to 250 military personnel to ostensibly provide security in the nation's capital.\nDon Lemon: This was all a show 03:19\n3. George Floyd autopsy \nBoth an independent autopsy and a medical examiner's report have deemed George Floyd's death a homicide, but they differ over what caused it. Experts hired by Floyd's family concluded he died of \"asphyxiation from sustained pressure\" when his neck and back were compressed by Minneapolis police officers. They also said Floyd was dead within four minutes after he was held to the ground. The medical examiner's office, however, concluded Floyd didn't suffocate, but rather died of heart failure brought on by the incident. Floyd will be laid to rest on June 9th, and boxer Floyd Mayweather will reportedly pay for the funeral.\nIndependent George Floyd autopsy differs from state's version 02:54\n4. Coronavirus \nThere's new evidence that the experimental drug remdesivir can help some coronavirus patients. Drugmaker Gilead Sciences announced a five-day course of the antiviral drug sped recovery in moderately ill patients with pneumonia from Covid-19. These were patients who were hospitalized, but not sick enough to need oxygen from a ventilator. It's a positive development, but outside experts aren't calling it a game changer quite yet. Meanwhile,  pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly and Company has started the first human trial of an antibody therapy designed to treat Covid-19. The first phase of the trial will test whether the therapy is safe and well-tolerated, and the results should be in later this month.\nVaccinologist: Here's what worries me about Covid-19 trials 02:30\n5. Facebook  \nSome Facebook employees staged a virtual protest over CEO Mark Zuckerberg's inaction on a series of controversial posts from President Trump. The public pushback comes after Twitter affixed fact checks and warning labels to a few of the President's tweets last week, while identical posts on Facebook went untouched. Zuckerberg said that though he personally had a \"visceral negative reaction\" to Trump's rhetoric, he also felt Facebook had a commitment to free expression.

When it didn't happen, Austin police reformers clamored for stronger oversight of the police, and rejoiced when the city unveiled a beefed-up independent watchdog office in 2018.\nWe offer several ways to reach our journalists securely.\nCalled the Office of Police Oversight, the new city department operates independently of the police department and aims to not only hold individual officers accountable, but also make policy recommendations that focus on systemic issues, such as racial profiling. Even so, it hasn't been enough to eliminate the types of incidents that result in allegations of police brutality and racial bias.\nSince the city began revamping its oversight arm in January of 2018, Austin police have tased a Black man on his knees with his hands in the air; fatally shot an unarmed Black man in his car in a parking lot; and fired \"less-lethal\" bean-bag projectiles into the crowd at rallies honoring George Floyd -- sending a 16-year-old Latino boy and a 20-year-old Black college student to the hospital with head injuries, the latter a skull fracture.\n\"There is so much work left to do,\" said Austin City Council member Greg Casar, who is a vocal advocate of stronger police reforms. \"Policy change alone isn't going to solely do the trick. We need a culture change within policing.\"\nA protester in Austin, Texas, is detained during a rally against the death in Minneapolis police custody of George Floyd.\nIn addition to touching off a worldwide movement, the police killing of Floyd in Minneapolis has provoked a flurry of interest in police accountability, which often takes the form of police oversight agencies.\nThe day's biggest stories in 10 minutes or less.\nSign up and get access to videos and weekly student quizzes.\nSign Me Up\nNo, Thanks\nBy subscribing you agree to our\nprivacy policy.\nIn recent weeks, at least a dozen cities have reached out to the National Association for Civilian Oversight of Law Enforcement (NACOLE) to either launch some form of new oversight agency or expand on existing ones, said its director of operations, Liana Perez.\nBut at a time when \"defund the police\" has become a rallying cry for some activists, the notion of an oversight agency holds little appeal for those who want fundamental change.\nDisciplinary record of ex-officer who held Eric Garner in chokehold is finally released\nEven the strongest proponents of the civilian oversight model say it, alone, isn't enough to reform policing in America.\n\"This whole discussion is about policy and culture,\" said Robin Kniech, a City Council member in Denver, whose system of oversight has been praised as a model by experts. \"You can have a great use-of-force policy, but if you have a culture of impunity, it doesn't work.\"\nCraig Futterman, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School, said civilian police watchdogs can -- in theory -- be effective. However, he said, most of them are hamstrung by a lack or shortage of four things: independence from police departments or city hall, transparency, funding and authority.\n\"The answer to me isn't that there is something fundamentally wrong with the premise of civilian oversight,\" he said. \"The problem is, in America we still have not really tried.\"\nWatchdogs are few and their authority runs the gamut\nAbout 165 of the nation's 18,000 police departments are subject to some form of police oversight -- meaning the vast majority of law enforcement agencies across America are left to police themselves, said Perez of NACOLE.\nThey come in a dizzying constellation of formats with varying levels of authority, but in general consist of either appointed volunteers or paid non-law enforcement professionals who are tapped to police the police.\nUsually, the bodies lack the power to impose discipline directly, acting instead as advisory panels for police chiefs, internal police department investigators or city managers. Some of the bigger agencies possess the authority to conduct their own investigations.\nTheir effectiveness -- and power -- runs the gamut.\nIn Los Angeles County, it was the FBI -- not its civilian watchdog -- that was investigating allegations of abuse of jail inmates at the hands of deputies that led to a coverup and criminal convictions of the former sheriff and some of his top officials.\nWant to reform the police? Hire more women\nIn Inglewood -- a city in Los Angeles County with a high rate of violent crime -- the citizen oversight panel's meetings have been canceled each month since June 2018, according to the city website. Emails from CNN asking the committee members about this dynamic were not returned, but a 2016 story in the Los Angeles Times quotes a city official saying the commission has \"no authority\" to \"discuss or oversee or even hear any cases of [or] related to officer involved shootings.\"\nBy contrast, one of the nation's strongest civilian oversight boards is located in the northern half of California -- the Oakland Police Commission.\nThis February, in an extremely rare move, the panel of civilian appointees voted unanimously to fire without cause Oakland's police chief, who had clashed with the commission over police shootings and diversity on the force, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. Their action required mayoral approval, which was granted.\nNYPD officer suspended without pay following 'disturbing apparent chokehold incident'\nBut the commission -- which says it was founded to oversee policies in the wake of \"a sex scandal involving multiple officers with a minor\" in May 2016 -- was dinged in an audit earlier this month for failing to review the department's budget, comply with the state's open meetings law and hire an inspector general, among other things.\nIn response, police commission Chair Regina Jackson said the \"auditor's criticisms fail to account for the full span of the commission's work or the full scope of the commission's authority.\"\nTom Nolan, an associate professor at Emmanuel College in Boston, said Oakland is an outlier.\n\"It's the only city that I'm aware of where it has a police review agency that actually has the authority to terminate the chief for cause, or to recommend to the mayor that the chief be terminated without cause,\" he told CNN.\nProtesters hold banners in support of Eric Garner at Union Square on December 3, 2014, in New York City. Garner died after being put in a chokehold during an alteration with NYPD officers.\nOn the opposite coast, it was New York City's Civilian Complaint Review Board -- not the criminal courts -- that brought discipline to the officer who placed a chokehold on Eric Garner, who died after uttering the words \"I can't breathe,\" wrote the chair of the panel in a 2019 op-ed.\nAlthough no criminal charges were filed against police officer Daniel Pantaleo, the review board -- which has the power to investigate claims of wrongdoing, rather than merely review the investigations of internal affairs -- acted as the prosecutor. Its findings were presented to an administrative judge, who made the recommendation that prompted the NYPD to terminate Pantaleo without pension.\nThe watchdog agency last week released all the prior complaints made against Pantaleo after the New York legislature -- prompted by public outrage over George Floyd's death -- repealed a law that had shielded the disciplinary files of police officers from public disclosure.\nOversight not 'the panacea many expected it to be'\nResearch reveals many police watchdogs remain largely toothless.\nNACOLE recently completed a survey of civilian oversight agencies, including 54 that oversee municipal police departments, and provided the unpublished results to CNN.\nTwenty-four said they didn't have the power to issue subpoenas; for five others, their subpoena power excluded sworn officers.\nOnly two agencies, in Detroit and Chicago, said they had \"the authority to implement or impose\" new or revised police policies.\nTwenty-one agencies said the departments they oversee weren't even required to formally respond to the recommendations they made -- let alone actually make any changes.\nThere's no playbook for the battle between mayors and police right now\nAll but four of the agencies said that their access to information like use of force records, stop or search reports, body camera footage or personnel files \"depends on the cooperation\" of the police department they oversee.\n\"Civilian oversight has not proven to be 'the panacea many expected it to be,'\" wrote Stephen Rushin, a police accountability expert at Loyola University, in a 2017 report for Duke Law School.\nCivilian oversight agencies have also been weakened by police unions.\nIn New Jersey last year, the Newark Fraternal Order of Police won a lawsuit that pulled the fangs out of a civilian review board, stripping it of its subpoena power to investigate complaints against police. The board won an appeal and the matter now is before the state Supreme Court, according to a recent report in the Center for Public Integrity.\nAlso in 2018, in Tennessee, the Nashville Fraternal Order of Police spent $500,000 on TV ads and other campaign activities calling on voters to oppose a charter amendment to form an oversight panel -- a proposal prompted in part by the police killing of two Black men by White officers, according to the Tennessean. Despite the union's efforts, the initiative prevailed.\nWhat could make oversight more effective?\nIn recent years, the civilian board model has been losing ground to an emerging model of oversight that now makes up about a quarter of the nation's oversight agencies, Perez said.\nThese are often referred to as \"auditing\" or \"monitoring\" agencies, and they are composed of paid staff -- not appointed volunteers, Perez said. Many of the staffers are \"monitors\" who are lawyers by trade and report to the city manager.\nThe idea is to set expectations for officers on the front end, to better avoid disasters on the back end.\n\"Back ends don't work without good front ends,\" said Barry Friedman, a law professor and director of the Policing Project at New York University School of Law. \"Policing desperately needs a front end.\"\nTo that point, Denver has emerged as a model for effective police oversight.\nDenver Police advance after firing tear gas canisters during a protest outside the State Capitol over the death of George Floyd, on May 30.\nDenver's Office of the Independent Monitor is a city department with 15 employees -- led by mayoral appointee Nicholas Mitchell -- who weigh in on \"back end\" discipline cases and \"front end\" matters of policy. In late 2013, Mitchell, who like many of his employees is an attorney, uncovered a large backlog of civilian complaints in the sheriff's department that included accusations by jail inmates that they'd been physically, sexually or verbally abused by deputies.\nKniech, the Denver City Council member, said this led to a series of reviews that culminated with a major structural change: removing the sheriff's internal review arm and reestablishing it as an independent entity.\n\"Internal affairs are no longer internal,\" said Kniech.\nColorado governor signs bill mandating police body cameras and banning chokeholds\nThe union representing sheriff's deputies told the Denver Post they believed the new division would just add unnecessary layers of bureaucracy.\n\"We're just very disappointed in how this is going,\" Mike Jackson, president of the union, told the newspaper.\nDenver's robust watchdog apparatus hasn't been enough to change some of the more deeply rooted problems.\n\"We have not overcome the institutionalized racism that lives in individual officers and in the system,\" Kniech said.\nPolice unions stand in the way of lasting reform\nKniech cited the 2015 case of Jessica \"Jessie\" Hernandez, age 17, who was sleeping in a car that was suspected stolen with four other teens. When police arrived and got out of their cars to talk to the teens, Hernandez, who was behind the wheel, started driving away. Officers fired four shots into the driver's side window of the car, killing Hernandez.\n\"Rather than jumping out of the way of the car, the officer shot into the car\" and killed Hernandez, she said.\nThe officers involved with the incident were cleared of criminal wrongdoing by the DA; the officer who shot into the car said he feared for his safety.\nHernandez's parents later sued the city, which paid the family $1 million in a settlement.\nDespite improvements, there's still more work to do in Austin\nAustin city officials boast that their new office of oversight is the strongest in Texas. But while it, like Denver, uses the monitoring and auditing approach, unlike Denver, Austin's office lacks subpoena power.\nIt has, however, been credited for its transparency.\nWhy some police officers rally around their colleagues -- even when they're accused of committing crimes\nNew rules enable citizens to file complaints anonymously and easily -- by a phone call, for instance. Each complaint is prominently posted online, with the accused officer's name redacted.\nComplaints have skyrocketed. The George Floyd protest alone, in which Austin police fired \"less-lethal\" beanbag rounds into the crowd, generated more than 200, according to Farah Muscadin, head of Austin's police oversight agency.\nAustin Police Chief Brian Manley said in a Twitter post that officers on one occasion fired into the crowd after a demonstrator hurled a water bottle and bag at the police. He acknowledged that police accidentally hit another man, Justin Howell, a 20-year-old college student who suffered a skull fracture when a beanbag projectile hit the back of his head.\nChas Moore, a local activist who spearheaded the drive for revamping the oversight office, said the resulting reform, to date, has been \"very, very, very incremental.\"\n\"The APD has a very long way of going before they begin to regain trust in the communities that they harm the most, which is Black and other communities of color,\" he said.\nIn December, Austin City Council voted unanimously to conduct an audit of the department for racism and bigotry.\nCalls are growing to defund police in the US. Here are some lessons from overseas\nChief Manley, who did not respond to a CNN request for comment, has defended the department against such accusations.\nEarlier this month, the City Council grilled him about whether the police response to the Floyd protest is a sign the department is in need of \"institutional reform,\" with one member pointing out that the police didn't fire \"less lethal\" munitions on people protesting the coronavirus shutdown.\n\"I don't believe that the occurrences of this weekend should lead people to believe automatically that there's a culture problem,\" he said, according to the local NPR affiliate.\nTo date, few of the complaints involving excessive use-of-force allegations have resulted in disciplinary action since the oversight office's official launch in late 2018, said Muscadin, adding that she and the policing community typically don't see eye-to-eye on use-of-force matters.\nSenate Democrats block GOP police reform bill, throwing overhaul effort into flux\n\"We will watch the same video and see two different things,\" said Muscadin, an attorney who, prior to relocating to Austin from Chicago for the position, worked as an assistant public defender for the Cook County Public Defender's Office.\nThe office also released a racial profiling report showing that Austin police disproportionately pull over black motorists, who make up 8% of the population but constitute 15% of the stops. Muscadin has recommended a racial-profiling policy for the department, as well as a mandatory class on the history of race and policing.\nAustin's most high-profile open case involves the fatal police shooting in April of Michael Ramos, an unarmed Black man.\nThe oversight office and the police department are squabbling over how to release the body-cam footage, which shows Ramos getting back into his car in a parking lot of his apartment complex after being shot with a beanbag round. When he pulls the car forward, an officer fires live rounds into it, killing Ramos. The officer believed the vehicle at that point was a weapon, police said.\nIn late May -- a few days after Floyd's death -- the district attorney announced that she would present the Ramos case to a grand jury.\nLast summer, the same officer who killed Ramos -- Christopher Taylor -- was one of the officers involved in the fatal shooting of 46-year-old Mauris DeSilva, who had reportedly been holding a knife to his own throat in his apartment building. Police said DeSilva was experiencing a mental health crisis, and that he walked toward officers while still clutching the knife.\nThe case touched off an internal investigation, but nearly one year after the incident, all the evidence -- including the body-cam footage -- remains sealed from the public amid a civil lawsuit pitting DeSilva's family against the city. (A police spokesperson told CNN the state attorney general has ordered the city to withhold the evidence pending the outcome of the district attorney's review of the case.)\nKen Casaday, president of the Austin Police Association, said Taylor and the other officer \"followed their training\" with respect to the DeSilva case.\n\"That's all we expect,\" he told CNN, saying he is withholding judgment in Ramos case because the investigation is ongoing.\nMeanwhile, Ramos's mother, Brenda Ramos, who has demanded that the officer who killed her son be held accountable, continues to wait.\n\"I just miss him so much,\" she said in a phone interview. \"I'm hurting more and more, because that officer is working on the street after what he's done.\""}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/12/us/oklahoma-city-derrick-scott/index.html", "headline": "Oklahoma City police release video of 2019 deadly arrest after protesters demand it", "published_date": "2020-06-12", "text": "(CNN)Oklahoma City police this week released body-camera video of a 2019 arrest of an armed black man who died not long after saying repeatedly during the encounter that he couldn't breathe -- footage that protesters had recently demanded.\nThe police footage of Derrick Scott's arrest was released to news media after demonstrators demanded the video in a recent Black Lives Matter protest in front of a city police station.\nThe demand came amid national uproar over last month's death in Minneapolis of George Floyd, who was not armed and had pleaded that he couldn't breathe as officers restrained him during an arrest. In that case, an officer is seen kneeling on the side of Floyd's neck, and this has moved some police departments around the world to start banning neck restraints.\nIn the Oklahoma City case, police have said Scott had a gun and ran from officers who approached him, and that all techniques used to restrain him were proper. The officers were cleared of criminal wrongdoing, Oklahoma City police say.\n'I can't breathe'\nThe incident happened on May 20, 2019, in Oklahoma City.

At least two officers run after him.\nLess than 30 seconds later, an officer catches up and tackles Scott to the ground near a curb, and tells him to put his hands behind his back.\nThe officer straddles Scott's back briefly as he works to gain control.\nAbout 10 seconds after the tackle, Scott says \"I can't breathe\" for the first time.\n\"I don't care,\" the tackling officer, a man, responds, still trying to control Scott's arms.\nA second officer -- a woman -- yells, \"Keep your hands behind your back.\" The male officer tells Scott to keep his hand out of his pockets.\nThe female officer says, \"I'm going to Tase you,\" as she helps to subdue Scott.\n\"I can't breathe, please,\" Scott says, less than 15 seconds after he made the first plea. \"I can't breathe.\"\nThe male officer, then kneeling beside Scott, straddles him across the back, appearing to try pull Scott's arm behind his back to be handcuffed.\nWhen a third officer arrives, she tells Scott, \"Stop, stop resisting now.\"\nAs all three officers work to put him in handcuffs, Scott continues to repeat: \"I can't breathe.\"\nOnce Scott is in handcuffs, the male officer switches from the straddling position and puts one knee on the back of Scott's leg.\n'He's acting like he's unconscious'\nNearly a minute later, as the officers attempt to roll Scott over, one of the female officers can be heard saying, \"He's acting like he's unconscious.\" One of the officers removes a gun from Scott's pocket as he lies handcuffed, face down in the grass. Scott can no longer be heard on the recording.\nAbout three more minutes pass without Scott saying anything. As the officers discuss details of the takedown before rolling Scott over on his side, he appears to be unconscious.\nA female officer says, \"I'll hold this leg down, but we need to get his knee, like, a little bit bent so that if he is not faking.\"\n\"Stay with us, man,\" the male officer says, as he appears to tap on Scott while his knee remains on Scott's leg.\nIn an image captured on the camera, Scott appears passed out.\nThe male officers says, \"He's not really,\" and begins to knead his fist into Scott's chest. Scott's head bobs with no apparent response as the female officer says, \"He's fine.\" A third officer checks his pulse and says, \"He's got a pulse, he's breathing.\"\nDuring this time Scott's face remains mostly off-camera. He is silent and his legs do not appear to move while the officers wait for an ambulance, which officers had called because Scott appeared to be in medical distress, police said.\nAfter about nine minutes, paramedics arrive.\nScott appears alert as paramedics examine him\nThe officer who had been kneeling on Scott stands up and places his foot on Scott's leg as the paramedics inspect him. Together they sit him up, from the back. Scott is holding his own head up and seems to once again be alert. With a jolt he begins to moan and resist the police officers, and they forcefully hold him down on the ground.\nScott's moans descend into a deep cry as officers and paramedics try to stand him up. As the officers lift Scott, he raises his knees as if to try to kick the officers but does not make contact. They continue to lift him onto a stretcher and cuff him to the gurney.\nAfter he was loaded into the ambulance, paramedics told the officers that he had become unresponsive, according to police. One of the officers helped paramedics administer CPR, police said.\nScott was taken to a medical center, where he was pronounced dead at 2:56 p.m., a report from the state's chief medical examiner's office says. That was about an hour after Scott was arrested.\nHe died of a collapsed lung, medical examiner says\nThe cause of death was a collapsed right lung, according to a report from the medical examiner's office.\nPhysical restraint, recent methamphetamine use, asthma, bullous emphysema (an air pocket in the lung) and atherosclerotic heart disease were listed as contributing factors to his death.\nThere was \"no fatal trauma,\" according to the medical examiner's report.\nFollowing an investigation by the Oklahoma City Police Department, the Oklahoma County District Attorney's Office reviewed the case and determined there was nothing inappropriate on the part of the officers, nor any evidence of any misconduct by the officers, police said.\nScott's mother: 'No mother or father should have to go through this'\nScott did have asthma, his mother, Vickey Scott, told CNN.\nVickey Scott said she didn't learn of her son's death until four days after he died. She wasn't allowed to see his body until the day before his funeral, eight days after the incident, she said.\nShe said she hasn't watched all of the body camera video because it was too painful.\n\"No mother or father should have to go through this,\" she told CNN.\nPolice say the officers' moves were proper\nWithrow, the police department spokesman, said the techniques used to restrain Scott are taught at police academy.\nHe said:\n\u2022 About straddling Scott's back: \"(The officer) starts out up on his abdomen area, when he's straddling his back, trying to gain control of him. As they gain more control over the suspect and he's handcuffed, that officer is sliding farther down on the suspect's body to his waist and ultimately to his leg, not restricting any of his ability to breathe at that time.\n\u2022 The female officer who placed her knee across Scott's shoulder blade did this to gain a reasonable amount of control while not restricting airflow, and it offered the \"least likelihood of injuring a suspect.\""}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/24/us/florida-coronavirus-cases-surge/index.html", "headline": "What's behind the surge of Covid-19 cases in Florida", "published_date": "2020-06-24", "text": "(CNN)As Florida emerges from its coronavirus shutdown, the state is experiencing a surge of Covid-19 cases, with younger Floridians accounting for a significant number of positive tests.\nThe Florida Department of Health reported an additional 3,286 cases of coronavirus on Tuesday, bringing the state total to 103,503.\nMedical experts and elected officials have attributed the rising numbers to a combination of more testing and more social contact as businesses reopen and, in recent weeks, to people's participation in large protests, although that has not been clearly established.\nNo state has successfully moved out of lockdown with the right tools in place, former CDC chief says\nIn Miami-Dade County, the state's most populous with 2.71 million people, data compiled by researchers at Florida International University shows that the number of positive Covid-19 tests has increased by an average of 35 every day during the past two weeks.\nResearchers also found that hospitalizations, intensive care visits and ventilation use have all begun to increase over the past two weeks. Combined with a rise in cases, researchers say, this evidence points to increased community spread.\n\"Municipalities received guidelines on reopening but they do not have guidelines on when to pull back, which is why it is so critical to monitor the cases closely before the hospitals and ICUs start to have capacity issues -- which is something we have avoided so far in Miami-Dade County,\" said Dr. Mary Jo Trepka, the head of the epidemiology department at FIU.\nPeople are 'out and about'\nHealth experts can't really say for sure why cases have risen, but from the data, it's clear that community transmission is ongoing, Trepka told CNN. \"More people are out and about,\" she said. \"That has most likely contributed to it.\"\nTrepka cited other factors as well, including children being out of school, the Memorial Day weekend and the recent protests in which some demonstrators did not wear masks. New research, however, suggests Black Lives Matter protests across the country have not led to a jump in coronavirus cases.\nTo limit transmission, she said, people should continue to perform the basic practices recommended by health officials over the past three months: Wear a mask, practice social distancing, wash your hands and, most importantly, stay home if you are sick or have symptoms.\nPeople enjoy a sunny day in Miami Beach, Florida, on June 16, 2020.\n\"Stay home until you get the test result back and it's negative,\" she said.\nFlorida is one of the states that does not have a statewide requirement that masks be worn, though the state's health department recommends them.\nLocal governments such as Miami-Dade County require the use of masks. Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, a Republican, told CNN on Monday that large venues where rallies or sports events are held would not be opening and that Miami was not heading into the third phase of reopening because of the rise in cases.\n\"It has really nothing to do with an increased amount of testing. It has to do with more people that are getting tested coming out positive,\" Suarez said.\nThe county is seeing record numbers of Covid-19 patients, the Miami Herald reports. One medical center in Homestead reached its ICU limit on Tuesday after county officials identified it as a hot spot of new cases.\n\"Countywide, hospitals report far more beds available than beds filled with COVID patients. Still, hospital administrators and emergency room physicians say they're concerned by the surge, and that they've resumed near daily meetings with state regulators,\" the newspaper wrote.\nPatients now are younger and not as sick as they were in April, The Herald wrote. That, combined with the knowledge gained then, means shorter hospitalizations and healthier results.\nOver the weekend, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis attributed the surge in cases to \"testing more.\" He said the vast majority of the cases in Florida now are in people with no symptoms.\nCounties such as Broward and Duval have a \"large 20-to-30-year-old population, mostly asymptomatic. But we're also seeing that not only are they testing positive because they're testing more, they're also testing positive at a higher rate,\" said DeSantis, a Republican.\nDeSantis said testing has also increased because of people \"returning to the workforce.\"\nAnother ICU demand surge?\nStates seeing an increase in the number of new Covid-19 cases will face \"another ICU demand surge,\" said Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, director of infectious diseases at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.\n\"There are time lags between the peak numbers we're seeing reported and the consequences that get people into the ICU. So you're looking at this two- to three-week period,\" Marrazzo told CNN on Tuesday.\n\"What makes me very concerned is that we are already seeing a spike in ICU admissions in a place like Florida,\" she said. \"And yet, the cases are continuing to climb. So, we're going to be facing another ICU demand surge in not that long a time.\"\n'It's still deadly': Florida Republicans urge caution as state sees spike in coronavirus cases\nIt is \"really important for us to think about the implications there -- in terms of readiness and in terms of blunting the consequences of these increased cases,\" Marrazzo added.\nDr. Andrew Pastewski, the head intensive care unit physician at Jackson South Medical Center in Miami, is also seeing a surge in patients, he said.\n\"A week ago we had eight patients, none on a ventilator,\" Pastewski told CNN on Tuesday. \"We were feeling like we were handling this well. We had a nice Covid floor, 24 beds with the capability of four ICU ventilators in that unit, so we thought we could use that as our Covid floor going forward.\n\"And within 10 days, we're now at over 40-plus patients, four on ventilators. We've had to find a second Covid unit and are looking for a third Covid unit right now.\"\nPastewski has two sets of patients in the ICU now: older patients who may live in a nursing home, and younger patients in their 50s and 60s, he said.\nSome of his colleagues are not seeing an increase in Covid patients going into ICU units as of now, Pastewski said.\n\"Some of them don't know that there's any kind of Covid surge happening because they only handle the Covid ICU patients,\" he said. \"My group at Jackson South sees every Covid patient in hopes of catching them before they get sick, so I know that the numbers are higher.\"\nThis recent rise in cases among young adults could lower Covid-19 death rates unless those same young adults infect others, according to a tweet from Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\"With younger age of recent infections in at least some places such as Florida, expect a lower death rate in this wave ... until the 20-to-40-year-olds who are infected today go on to infect others,\" Frieden, president and CEO of the initiative Resolve to Save Lives, tweeted Sunday.\nThe shift of the coronavirus pandemic to younger Americans is not necessarily good news, said Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute.\nYounger people are less likely to get sick and less like to die from the virus, Jha told CNN. But even if they aren't sick, they can infect others, he noted.\n\"Those younger people have parents. They have grandparents, and they are going to go see those people,\" he said.\n\"The more the virus spreads, the more everybody is vulnerable.\"\nCNN's Jay Croft, Melissa Alonso, Gisela Crespo, Maggie Fox, Jamiel Lynch and Hollie Silverman contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/08/us/george-floyd-houston-visitation/index.html", "headline": "Thousands of mourners visit George Floyd's casket in Houston to pay respects", "published_date": "2020-06-08", "text": "(CNN)Thousands of mourners gathered at The Fountain of Praise church in Houston on Monday to pay their respects to George Floyd, whose death in Minneapolis police custody has sparked protests around the United States and across the world.\nFloyd, 46, grew up in the city's Third Ward and will be buried in Houston next to his mother, according to the Fort Bend Memorial Planning Center.\nGeorge Floyd's funeral will be live-streamed from Houston on Tuesday\nFloyd was a huge role model for a lot of people, his brother, Philonise Floyd, said during the visitation ceremony.\n\"He was the first person who everybody looked up to in our neighborhood because he was the first one to get a scholarship to go and play basketball or football when he wanted to do,\" Philonise Floyd said.\nFloyd was someone who also had a beautiful soul, his younger brother, Rodney Floyd, said.\n\"If he was told he would have to sacrifice his life to bring the world together, and knowing him, I know he would've did it,\" Rodney Floyd said.\nHe added that he's still processing the death. \"It seems unreal because, you know, every day is like waiting on that phone call.

Close to 10,000 people were expected to attend the visitation, which was open from noon to 6 p.m. local time Monday, said La'Torria Lemon, spokeswoman for the funeral home.\nTo comply with social distancing rules, only 15 masked guests were allowed inside the church at a time. Guests were allowed to stay inside no more than 10 minutes after viewing the body. Guests must wear a mask and gloves, and casual attire was permitted.\nMany of the visitors wore shirts supporting Black Lives Matter and stating Floyd's last words, \"I can't breathe.\" With gospel songs playing in the background from artists including CeCe Winans and Kurt Carr, several mourners wiped away tears as they stopped in front of the casket.\nAbbott called Floyd's death \"the most horrific tragedy\" he has ever seen.\n\"George Floyd is going to change to arc of the future of the United States,\" Abbott said. \"George Floyd has not died in vain. He life will be a living legacy about the way America and Texas respond to this tragedy.\"\nAbbott said he is already working with legislators and is committed to working with the family to \"ensure we never have anything like this ever occur in the state of Texas.\" He hinted there may be a \"George Floyd Act\" in the works \"to make sure we will not have police brutality like what happened to George Floyd.\"\nSen.

Coronavirus\nSome people who have never had the coronavirus may still have some immunity to it, which could reduce the severity of an infection. How? A new study found individuals who showed some immunity had T cells that were reactive, possibly from exposure to other strains of coronavirus. (Remember, the current strain is just one of many.) Now, scientists want to know more about the role these T cells play in fighting the disease. Another study about the presence of genetic material from the virus in children has raised questions about whether young kids are more likely to transmit it. That's not exactly encouraging news, with many children in the US headed back to school soon. Of the 15 biggest school districts in the country, 10 will begin the school year with online learning only.\nSee how risky your choices are right now 02:53\n2. Election 2020\nPresident Trump floated the idea of postponing the November presidential election, prompting swift and unequivocal pushback from both sides of the aisle. Trump criticized mail-in voting in a tweet and said, \"Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???\" The bottom line is, he doesn't have the authority to do that. Congress sets the election date. And GOP leaders like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy and Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz made it clear the election has never been delayed and never should be delayed. Many critics see the suggestion, even if it doesn't amount to anything, as a clear threat to the American democratic process. Meanwhile, Trump's campaign canceled a series of ad buys over the next few days to review messaging.\nTrump questions whether US should 'delay the election' 03:00\n3. Economy\nAmerica's big economic comeback is sputtering as coronavirus cases pick back up. The US economy contracted at a 32.9% annual rate from April through June, its worst drop on record, and unemployment claims rose for the second week in a row. The grim economic data caused stocks to sink as newfound uncertainty about the predicted economic rebound grows. Not everyone is feeling the pain, though. Amazon and Apple both posted gains this quarter, and Facebook's stock has risen as socially distanced users flock to the platform. Pandemic-era home cooking regimens have boosted Kraft Heinz's bottom line, too.\nUS reports worst economic plunge on record 00:55\n4. Stimulus\nThree key relief programs have either lapsed or are about to expire as Congress continues to debate the next round of coronavirus aid. The $600 unemployment enhancement ends today. A federal moratorium on evictions ended last Friday, leaving more than 12 million renters at risk for homelessness. And the Paycheck Protection Program, which still has $130 billion intended to help small businesses, is set to expire August 8. It doesn't help that, after several days of negotiations following the Republican Senate stimulus proposal, GOP and Democratic leaders are reportedly no closer to an agreement on what to do next.\nThis small business stood for a century, but Covid-19 closed it in months 02:45\n5. Hong Kong\nHong Kong's government has barred a dozen candidates from the city's legislative elections in September and says more disqualifications may be coming. The decision has raised even more questions about the integrity of the contest and the democratic freedoms of Hong Kong citizens. The city continues to feel the effects of the new national security law imposed by China at the beginning of the month. Behavior like advocating for Hong Kong independence or self-determination is grounds for election disqualification.

She'd been released from rehabilitation two days prior. Jefferson was a caretaker.

Officer Aaron Dean did not identify himself as police. He demanded, through the window, that Jefferson show her hands before opening fire, killing her, bodycam footage shows.\n\"That is a blessing that I think that we have for ours is that we have a video because how would that narrative have went?\" asked Ashley Carr. \"What we have noticed, even with the Ahmaud Arbery case, is that that narrative is not how the video went. ... If the cameras weren't there, all of a sudden it could've been, 'It was a shootout and blah blah blah,' and we would've had to take their word.\"\nThe family has struggled watching videos of recent police killings.\n\"Revictimization: I didn't think how serious it was until I really started watching other people get killed,\" brother Adarius Carr, the father of a 7-month-old, said. \"I definitely feel the passion, the hurt, the anger rebubble up -- the need to do something, the need to fix our community, the need to figure out what can I do to make this world better for my son and for kids Zion's age. ... It happens every time that I watch it, so that's why I said sometimes I just don't watch it. You can't.\"\nAshley Carr never finished watching the Floyd video, in which a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for almost eight minutes. \"Longest video of my life,\" she said. She's familiar with other killings, and it makes her question the rules. At least during Jim Crow, she said, it was clearer what Black people could and couldn't do.

Upon seeing the 46-year-old plead for his mama, she thought of her sister.\n\"I wouldn't say I felt her or I saw her, but it made me wonder,\" she paused for several seconds, tears welling in her eyes. \"What were her last words? To hear them say their last words, did she cry out for her mom?

Jefferson had moved home to Fort Worth to help care for her. Yolanda learned of Jefferson's death in the hospital. She was too sick to attend the funeral and sent a eulogy for the pastor to read. Less than three months later, she passed.\n\"Being in the hospital and not being able to be herself and not being able to fight, that's crazy,\" Ashley Carr said. \"It's a lot of emotions that come back up, but through all of these emotions, we all have to still get up and go do jobs. We have to make sure that our kids are ready, that the household is still running -- all while having this on our back. It becomes a lot.\"\nFrom left, Jefferson and Amber, Yolanda, Adarius, Zion and Ashley Carr.\nAmber Carr hears praise about how well she's handling the loss, but there's no magic to it, she said. She has no choice but to persevere.\n\"People ask all the time, 'How do you do it? How do you smile through it all?' It's life, you know? You have to keep living,\" she said. \"I have my moments where I might not sleep for days or I might be in the car and I just start crying. You just have your moments.\"\nLike anyone, there are times when the siblings want to block out the world and forget their woes, but it isn't realistic. They must fight for justice. They must keep their sister's name alive, to ensure people understand she lived for something and died for nothing.\n\"Some days, you do want to just crawl up under a rock and pray that this all goes away. You think you're living in a nightmare, but this is life. This is our new normal, as they call it. We're trying to embrace this new life,\" Ashley Carr said.\nThe Atatiana Project and Sisters of the Movement\nAdarius Carr wishes he could do more. He left home about 12 years ago and now serves as a boatswain's mate in the US Navy. Military obligations prevent him from being as involved as his sisters in activism.\nOne of the family initiatives of which he's proudest is the Atatiana Project, which serves to bridge police and urban communities, and promotes STEM careers -- with an emphasis on coding and gaming -- for children. Jefferson, a biology graduate from Xavier University of Louisiana, worked in pharmaceutical equipment sales and wanted to become a doctor.\nThe Atatiana Project launched on Juneteenth.\nVictim's brother: I'm speechless about this 02:05\nAdarius, 32, loved playing video games with his little sister. Role-playing, fighting games -- nothing was off limits. As kids, they'd play all night and be bushed when it came time to go to school, he said. The memory brings a bright smile to his face.\nThe last time the Navy chief petty officer came home from deployment, he and Jefferson played Warframe for four days -- \"all night giggling, laughing, telling jokes. She's always a class act, always had me in stitches.\"\nToday, he keeps his sister's pillow in his gaming room in San Diego, where he's stationed. He catches himself asking her questions about the games he's playing.\n\"Giving back is a big thing for us in general,\" he said of the Atatiana Project. \"When you're hurting, it is sometimes better to just get people around you that understand the hurt, or you can help them with their hurt. We've been through a lot, and we want to see if we can help the next person.\"\nAmber and Ashley Carr have found solace in another initiative, Sisters of the Movement, an organization founded by women who lost siblings to police violence, including Sandra Bland's, Terence Crutcher's and Shantel Davis'.\nAnother founder, Allisa Charles-Findley, the sister of Botham Jean -- who, too, was killed in his own home by a Texas police officer -- helped Ashley Carr navigate losing a sibling and \"the different things that go on with family dynamics,\" Carr said.\nBotham Jean and Atatiana Jefferson were both killed by police in their homes.\n\"We end up realizing we are part of a movement and we need to be heard and that we do matter -- and that the people, they needed a voice and we want to be the voice,\" Ashley Carr said. \"That helped me show that I'm OK. ... These are valid feelings to be feeling angry, to be feeling upset, to be feeling like, How in the world could this happen to somebody who was just literally at home?\"\nAmber Carr texts with Botham Jean's mother, Allison, periodically. She's hilarious and \"a breath of fresh air,\" Carr said. Taking Zion and Zayden to visit her in St. Lucia is on Amber Carr's \"vision board\" for the future, she said.\n\"Those women, they're relatable,\" she said. \"That part helps me, to know I'm not by myself.\"\nWaiting for justice\nAs the A-Team grapples with grief and justice, former Fort Worth police officer Aaron Dean awaits trial on a murder charge.\nYolanda Carr sobbed from her hospital bed upon learning Dean was indicted in December, but she died weeks later.\nVictim's brother gets emotional, demands cop's arrest 02:10\nDean had tendered his resignation and has been free on $200,000 bail. The state police union will help pay for his defense. Dean's attorney, Jim Lane, declined to comment, citing the court's gag order, but told CNN last year, \"My client is sorry and his family is in shock.\"\nJefferson's siblings don't know much about the case. No one has given them a timeline. When Amber Carr last spoke to prosecutors, she said, she was told there are other cases ahead of theirs.\n\"We just have to wait our turn,\" Carr said. Because of Covid-19, the state has placed trials on hold until at least September 1, and no information on Dean's trial or next hearing is available, said Sam Jordan, spokeswoman for the Tarrant County district attorney's office.\nThe question the siblings keep asking: Why is this dragging out? It's so clear-cut, so egregious in their minds, it should be open-and-shut, they say. Where's the accountability?\nOfficer charged with murder after killing woman in her home 01:54\nAshley Carr, a former educator, is a budget analyst for Houston schools. If she were to hurt or upset a child, there'd be questions to answer. Amber Carr is a cosmetologist. If she were accused of cutting a client or being unsanitary, Texas might pull her license. Adarius Carr is a sailor. Every time he pulls the trigger, he has to answer to someone. They feel they're held to stiffer standards than police, they say.\n\"Rules of engagement is big in the military, and I don't see how my rules of engagement are a lot stricter than theirs,\" Adarius Carr said. \"They defend us, so it baffles me.\"\nMemories buoy siblings\nUntil they get answers, they'll keep championing Jefferson's legacy. They find warmth in the memories of their beautiful, smiling sister who would do anything for them.\nAshley and Amber will remember when they flew out to San Diego to see Adarius and saw The O'Jays at the 2018 county fair. Video from the concert shows them laughing and dancing and having a ball.\nJefferson loved her tunes -- all genres, from gospel to metal -- and was a talented musician, earning first chair for clarinets at every school she attended, the siblings said.\nAtatiana, Adarius and Amber Carr pose with \"sister-cousin\" Cerese Fortson In San Diego in 2018.\nAshley Carr will always think fondly of the last show they saw together: Beyonce and Jay-Z during the 2018 On the Run II Tour -- in Beyonce's and Ashley's hometown of Houston, no less. Jefferson had never been to a concert of that scale, her sister said, and Ashley didn't realize Jefferson was such an enthusiastic member of the Beyhive until that day. They had such fun, Ashley looked forward to more shows with her sister.\n\"I was like, 'Man, we're doing this all the time.' In my head, I was like, 'This is going to be my new concert buddy,'\" she said. \"When I listen to Beyonce, I always think of her. I always say, 'We had our moment.' We did have our moment, and I'm going to cherish that moment.\""}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/23/us/five-things-july-23-trnd/index.html", "headline": "5 things to know for July 23: Coronavirus, economy, stimulus, China, MLB", "published_date": "2020-07-23", "text": "Get '5 Things' in your inbox\nIf your day doesn't start until you're up to speed on the latest headlines, then let us introduce you to your new favorite morning fix.

Coronavirus\nThe US Department of Health and Human Services and Department of Defense have reached a $1.95 billion agreement with the drug company Pfizer to produce at least 100 million doses of a Covid-19 vaccine. Depending on when one is made available, the doses could start shipping out as early as the last quarter of this year. However, there are still myriad questions about how a potential vaccine will be distributed. It can't come too soon, though. The US just recorded its second straight day with more than a thousand Covid-19 deaths. South Korea has fallen into a recession, and Australia has announced its economy has been severely damaged by the pandemic. Oh, and if you're in Ohio, it's time to mask up: A statewide mask mandate goes into effect today.\nFauci responds to Trump: I consider myself more of a realist 00:50\n2. Economy\nCities could lose $1.5 trillion in economic activity this year, and that's not even a worst-case scenario. A new report from the US Conference of Mayors predicts a major drop in economic output even if the pandemic is brought under control in the coming months. The unemployment rate is falling and retail sales seem to be picking up again, but experts like Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon say even the best road to recovery will be a bumpy ride. Solomon predicts \"very, very high unemployment for an extended period of time.\" Margaret Keane, the CEO of Synchrony Financial, says she is concerned Americans won't be able to keep up with their credit card payments if the $600 unemployment benefit lapses at the end of the month.\nSenate GOP push back against WH priorities in stimulus plan 02:36\n3. Stimulus\nHelp may be on the way for the country's aforementioned economic woes. GOP senators and White House negotiators say they've reached a deal on the general aspects of a new stimulus package, which means we could see the party's long-awaited full proposal soon. The plan will feature $105 billion for schools and additional billions in coronavirus response funds. GOP legislators are hopeful the White House will support the latter, which includes $25 billion in additional funding for Covid-19 testing and contact tracing, along with roughly $26 billion for therapeutics and vaccine development and distribution. If the next round of relief includes another stimulus check, that could be a lifesaver for millions of families who missed out on the first one. An estimated 12 million economically vulnerable Americans didn't receive the first stimulus payment.\nSenate GOP push back against WH priorities in stimulus plan 02:36\n4. China\nThe tension between the US and China has reached a new front: consulates. The US has demanded that China shut down its consulate in Houston, an edict the State Department says is punishment for Chinese intellectual property theft and the country's perceived aggressions against the US. Beijing has vowed to retaliate, potentially by shuttering one of the US' numerous diplomatic missions within China. The FBI also announced it believes China is harboring a fugitive scientist accused of visa fraud at its San Francisco consulate. Some experts say it's important for the US to crack down on China's cyber and industrial espionage and human rights abuses, but others believe the escalation is part of the Trump administration's strategy to boost the President's profile before November's election.\nPompeo addresses order to close China's Houston consulate 02:45\n5. MLB\nIt's finally Opening Day for Major League Baseball, and this season is going to look and feel different in almost every possible way. There will be no fans, no spitting, limited touching, and in addition to normal injured lists, teams will maintain lists of players quarantined or isolation because of Covid-19. Also, the Toronto Blue Jays are still looking for a place to play after their request to use their home stadium was denied by the Canadian government due to nationwide coronavirus restrictions. You can also expect more activism this season. Multiple players from teams like the San Francisco Giants and the Cincinnati Reds have already spoken out against racial injustice during preseason games by taking a knee during the national anthem. In Boston, the Red Sox put up a billboard over the Massachusetts Turnpike that reads, in Sox-style typeface, \"Black Lives Matter.\"\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\nDolly Parton has a new rooftop bar in Nashville, and it's everything you've ever dreamed of\nWhenever we work up the courage to go to bars again, this is our first stop.\nYour cheers, claps and boos can influence the stadium atmosphere at MLB games\nAssuming you're not just sitting catatonic on your couch with your hand in a bag of chips (no judgment).\nA new flying robot can glide, flip and hover with its wings\nIf you thought those robot dogs were unsettling, wait until you meet this giant robot insect!\nHere's another study on how dark chocolate is good for your health\nPass it on.\nA nationwide aluminum can shortage is bad news for beer lovers\nPackage it in Capri Sun pouches instead.

Right?'\nFollowing backlash to posts in which DeSean Jackson misattributed an anti-Semitic trope to Hitler and said that Jewish people planned to \"extort America\" and achieve \"world domination,\" the 33-year-old apologized.\nIn his apology post, the Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver said he will \"fully educate\" himself and work with local and national organizations to \"be more informed and make a difference in our community.\"\nNew England Patriots wide receiver Julian Edelman, who is Jewish, acknowledged his NFL counterpart said \"ugly things\" but stated he saw \"an opportunity to have a conversation\" with DeSean Jackson. The Eagles wide receiver has already accepted an invitation from Chairman David Adelman of the Horwitz-Wasserman Holocaust Memorial Plaza to tour the Philadelphia plaza and attend an educational session, Adelman wrote.\nNFL star apologizes for anti-semitic social media post 03:20\nStephen Jackson still weighed in, however, saying in a now-deleted Instagram video that while he read the Eagles' statement on their receiver, DeSean Jackson was merely \"trying to educate himself, educate people, and he's speaking the truth. Right? He's speaking the truth. You know he don't hate nobody, but he's speaking the truth of the facts that he knows and trying to educate others.\"\nLater, he sent out an Instagram post saying, \"Your races pain doesn't hurt more than the next races pain.

Never waste time explaining to people who never supported u anyway.

Cooper is white.\n\"Maybe I could've been more clear of what I thought DeSean was correct about, but I didn't feel the need to go into a conversation that me and him had about how they were treating him and Riley Cooper.

The team is also weighing what actions to take, the statement said.\n\"We are disappointed and we reiterated to DeSean the importance of not only apologizing, but also using his platform to take action to promote unity, quality and respect,\" the Eagles tweeted.\nStephen Jackson speaks at a demonstration in Minneapolis on June 11.\nAsked again why he would co-sign something DeSean Jackson had retracted, Stephen Jackson replied, \"Nice try. I've been out here fighting for justice, for equality, and I was speaking on equality -- why they wasn't handling Cooper and DeSean Jackson any other way.\n\"Like I said, they can twist how they want to. You didn't hear a word out of my mouth saying I hate Jews. You didn't hear a word out of my mouth saying I'm supporting Hitler. They can twist it how they want. I don't hate nobody. I've been standing for everybody.\"\nHe'll continue that fight, he said, \"and that's just the end of it.\"\nEx-NBAer explains another Instagram post\nStephen Jackson further said nobody would be able to find video of him saying he hated anyone. Presented with a separate instance on Instagram in which he appeared to employ during a live conversation another Jewish trope -- alleging the prominent Rothschild family controlled the banks -- Stephen Jackson again touted his love for everyone.\n\"We was talking about money, and when I said that, he didn't take it the wrong way,\" he said, referring to an unidentified person involved in the Instagram chat. \"He said that people with money wasn't associated with Jews, and I just asked him that. It wasn't an insult, and he didn't take it as an insult. ... We had a good conversation, so the person I'm talking to understood what I was saying and he didn't take it as an insult.

I just want that same energy when we're getting killed in the street,\" he said.\nStephen Jackson played for eight teams during his career, snaring a ring with the San Antonio Spurs in 2003.
