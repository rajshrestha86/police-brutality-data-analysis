Shortly after that, another man kneels on his neck, and the re-enactment of Floyd's death begins.\nOther eyewitness videos, taken by Black Lives Matters marchers, pick up what happened next.\n\"I felt something was happening because the officers began shifting us to the opposite side of the street as we marched closer to that area,\" Russell Sampson, a Black Lives Matter marcher, told CNN.\nTen seconds after the escorting police cars roll by, when the marchers approach, the kneeling man starts shouting at them. \"You don't comply, that's what happens,\" he screams, gesturing at the protesters to the person underneath him. \"Look ... he didn't comply! He didn't comply. If he would have complied, that wouldn't have happened.\"\nThe organizer of the Black Lives Matter protest in Franklinville, Daryan Fennal, told CNN she was brought to tears seeing the re-enactment.\n\"I saw mothers trying to cover their children's eyes,\" she told CNN in a statement.\n\"Racism is everywhere, but to put it on display in such a gruesome and public way was what surprised me.\"\nAfter the protesters pass by, the man taking the video then begins commenting on the Black Lives Matter marchers.\n\"Blacks lives matter to no one,\" he is heard saying in the video. \"All lives matter. All lives matter. Police lives matter. God bless the police. God bless the police. You dumbass protesters.\"\nCorrections officer suspended, FedEx employee fired\nThe re-enactment drew quick criticism as the videos were shared widely on social media.\nNew Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy condemned the behavior, saying that \"mocking\" Floyd's murder to, \"belittle the calls for justice from our black and brown communities is repugnant.\"\nAfter the videos surfaced and outrage grew online, the New Jersey Department of Corrections said it had suspended an officer it says was, \"participating in the filming of a hateful and disappointing video that mocked the killing of George Floyd.\"\n'Stop the pain': George Floyd's brother calls on lawmakers to overhaul policing laws\nThe department has also begun a \"thorough and expedited\" investigation into the officer.\nA source familiar with the situation tells CNN the suspended officer is Joseph DeMarco, who has been employed by NJDOC for at least 18 years. The source said that after having \"a conversation\" with his union on Tuesday, DeMarco retained a private attorney. DeMarco was to be interviewed by NJDOC internal affairs on Wednesday morning, according to the source.\nA hearing will be held after internal affairs makes their recommendation and then it will be decided whether DeMarco is suspended with or without pay, the source says.\nMultiple calls by CNN to DeMarco have not been returned.\nLocal union President William Sullivan told CNN the union -- which represents approximately 6,000 correctional police officers in New Jersey -- was made aware of the incident around 12:30 p.m. on Tuesday after \"a lot of officers called in and were upset.\"\n\"We need to continue practicing tolerance and understanding; not discrimination and hate,\" the union said in a statement on their Facebook page. \"As a collective group, we pray for those who are hurting and we are here to help each and every one of them heal.\"\nIn a statement, FedEx said it has fired one employee it it allegedly saw in the video at the protest.\n\"FedEx holds its team members to a high standards of personal conduct, and we do not tolerate the kind of appalling and offensive behavior depicted in this video. The individual involved is no longer employed by FedEx. We stand with those who support justice and equality,\" reads the statement.\nCNN continues to try to reach the former FedEx employee for comment, as well as the suspended corrections officer.\nBut Daryann Fennal, the Black Lives Matter organizer, says this won't take away from her efforts. She says she can't \"unsee\" the re-enactment and calls it scary and terrifying. \"Despite the horrible incident we witnessed, I remain hopeful for the future and I hope we at least reached one person's heart yesterday,\" she said.\nCNN's Alta Spells, Taylor Romine and Lauren del Valle contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/20/us/jason-mraz-donates-look-for-the-good-album-trnd/index.html", "headline": "Jason Mraz is donating all the earnings from his new album to Black Lives Matter and other groups", "published_date": "2020-06-20", "text": "(CNN)Jason Mraz is honoring Juneteenth by donating all of the profits from his new album to Black Lives Matter and other organizations working toward equality and justice.\nThe two-time Grammy winner released \"Look For The Good\" on Friday, the same day that African-Americans celebrate the black community's emancipation from slavery in the United States.\n\"On June 19th, a historic day in the advancement of equality, I am proud to stand in solidarity with and be of service to Black Lives by donating all of my earnings from sales and streams of my new LP recording, Look For The Good,\" Mraz tweeted.\nJuneteenth has received increased attention in the wake of nationwide protests against police brutality and racial injustice, sparked by the death of George Floyd at the hands of the police in Minneapolis.\nThe self-proclaimed \"Geek in the Pink\" will immediately start by donating his $250,000 advance on royalties, he said in a news release.\nThe first six organizations to receive a portion of his donation are Black Lives Matter, San Diego Young Artists Music Academy, RISE San Diego, Grassroots Law Project, Center on Policy Initiatives, and the Equal Justice Initiative.\n\"I am announcing my contributions publicly in hopes of inspiring other creators and leaders in business to do the same -- to share the wealth, to share the profits, and to acknowledge that life is only great when it's great for everyone,\" Mraz said.\nEvery year, the artist will choose various organizations that work on advancing \"equality and justice\" to receive donations from the album's profits."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/24/us/black-lives-matter-why-i-march-trnd/index.html", "headline": "The three reasons Black Lives Matter marchers refuse to quit", "published_date": "2020-07-24", "text": "(CNN)Almost two months to the day since since George Floyd was killed and away from the media spotlight, protesters in cities across the country continue to pound the pavement.\nEven if there aren't tens of thousands of people flooding the streets as they did at the beginning of the summer, the demonstrators carry on -- unafraid of police presence and unrelenting in the face of potential coronavirus infections.\nEach has their own reason. Some personally experienced the sting of police brutality. Some demand things need to change.\nFor their unique motivations, all of them agreed -- this work has become a vital part of who they are.\nHere are three reasons why they still march.\nTo maintain momentum\nTyrell Taylor, pictured center in the red hat, leads Black Lives Matter protests on bikes.\nBefore the pandemic, 22-year-old Tyrell Taylor and 12 of his friends used to get together and do anything they could to stay active. Those meetups came to a screeching halt once New York started shutting down in March.\nTo beat the boredom, they formed a group called MBR, or Mind, Body, Results, for organized bike rides.\nAfter the death of George Floyd, those leisurely rides became acts of protest.\nThe group meets every Friday at 6 p.m. with a few exceptions. They've occupied the Brooklyn Bridge, Washington Square Park and Times Square, among other iconic New York locales. At their largest protest, Taylor and his friends rode with 1,000 cyclists.\nClogging the streets with bikes is both disruptive and peaceful, Taylor, a graduate student at Medaille College, told CNN. Their bikes have become their platforms for anti-racism.\n\"Our main focus is to be a community, a family,\" Taylor said, \"Without that, we're just a bunch of strangers yelling 'Black Lives Matter' and that's not what we want to create, we want people to know and be familiar with what they're going into the protest to achieve.\"\nAt their largest protest, over 1,000 cyclists joined Taylor and his friends.\nThe group's founding members have all experienced dehumanizing encounters with police -- racial profiling, police brutality, stop-and-frisk. Like many Black Lives Matter protesters, they're calling to defund the city's police department. NYPD funding accounts for around 6% of the city's overall budget.\nTaylor has had to cancel protests at times, but the group would come back the following week stronger. Quitting would mean throwing away almost two months of progress, Taylor said\n\"I would say, even if you feel like it's getting repetitive, if you're getting tired of doing it, continue to do it, because they're waiting for you to stop,\" he said. \"And knowing that they're waiting for us to stop, makes us want to go twice as hard.\"\nTaylor said he thinks now the movement for Black lives is peaking.\n\"People are falling off, but it's our job to maintain this peak.\"\nTo be an ally\nWiliam Kilgore has attended protests weekly in St. Petersburg, Florida, since George Floyd's death.\nFlorida native William Kilgore has hardly gone a day without marching for Black lives since protests began in May. He's documented the demonstrations in St. Petersburg, a burgeoning city along the state's Gulf Coast, on Twitter since their inception, and he said he's seen them grow more unified, even if turnout is lower than it was initially.\n\"You have to understand that this is a marathon, not a sprint,\" he told CNN. \"I'd say the focus and organization is actually much stronger than it was on day one.\"\nBlack Lives Matter protests across America continue nearly 2 months after George Floyd's death\nKilgore, who is White, said his community appears to be progressive, but the Black Lives Matter movement has laid bare inequalities in education, income and opportunity within the city.\n\"Racism is still deeply ingrained in every institution of this city,\" he said.\nThe St. Petersburg Police Department showed it was receptive to change this month when it announced it will dispatch social workers to some non-violent calls instead of uniformed officers.\nIt's a start, said Kilgore, who support defunding the police department, but \"not enough to satiate people's thirst for true equality.\" The announcement came around the same time police began to fine protesters for blocking the street.\nFlorida has its hands full with the coronavirus pandemic with nearly 400,000 cases, and St. Petersburg is no exception with over 14,000 of those cases. But Kilgore said attention must continue to be paid to the movement for Black lives.\n\"I plan on staying the course as long as it takes to achieve radical change here in St. Pete,\" he said. \"I am in it for the long haul.\"\nTo disrupt the status quo\nFrederick Edwards Jr. (left) and Jamaal Abegaz march for Black lives in Fargo, North Dakota.\nFargo, North Dakota, didn't have a formal Black Lives Matter chapter until a few days after the death of George Floyd, when four residents coalesced to found the organization's Fargo-Moorhead branch.\nThey've had to become a family fast.\nBefore they joined the Black Lives Matter board, they advocated for Black lives in Fargo in different ways: Kiara Jackson is president of North Dakota State University's Black Student Association, where she met fellow board member and graduate student Frederick Edwards Jr. There's Faith Dixon, who runs a daycare and nonprofit in Fargo, and Jamaal Abegaz works with the local Democratic Socialists group.\nFor their differences in background and age, they're a formidable team. They've led several marches since May 30 in their predominantly White community and met with local officials to plead for change.\nTheir work energizes them. It's also made them targets, they told CNN.\nThey've been told their protests \"make the town look bad.\" Abegaz said he's received death threats.\n\"Just the simple act of saying that things need to change and that we're not going to go along with the status quo puts our lives in harm,\" Abegaz said.\nFaith Dixon (left), Edwards and Kiara Jackson pose at a Juneteenth march planned by Black Lives Matter of Fargo/Moorhead.\nThe violence of the first protest has affected subsequent turnout. The initial march after Floyd's death attracted over 3,000 participants. Now up to 300 people join them, the group told CNN.\nDixon said they've been painted as the enemy, which intimidates residents from joining them.\n\"We are citizens of this community which we love,\" Dixon said. \"I own a business here. Our families are here. Why would we want to see a city we care so much about be ruined ... We're four individuals that have a right to speak and have a right to protest, and why is it such a huge fight just to do that?\"\nAmong their demands are defunding the police, or reallocating some of the police department's budget to social services like education and public health. They want a police oversight board that doesn't include police, and they want new police recruits to complete a college-level course about the cultural diversity of the area. And they've asked police to immediately end their use of force, including the use of tear gas and rubber bullets at protests.\nThe demonstrators will hold as many more protests as it takes for those changes to come, Dixon said. Their work has become a part of who they are.\n\"We're organizing for our lives,\" Abegaz said. \"We have to live, so we're not going to live under somebody's boot.\""}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/21/us/espys-black-lives-matter-opening-spt-trnd/index.html", "headline": "The ESPY Awards make sure viewers know Black Lives Matter", "published_date": "2020-06-22", "text": "(CNN)The 2020 ESPY Awards opened up with a powerful message Sunday.\nSeattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson, US Women's National Team soccer star Megan Rapinoe and WNBA guard Sue Bird were all wearing Black Lives Matter T-shirts. The three athletes not only discussed historic athletes who stood up to racism like Muhammad Ali and Jackie Robinson, but they also discussed the current climate and how returning to sports shouldn't be a return to the way things were before protests over the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Rayshard Brooks at the hands of police.\n\"The only thing that must die is racism. Black Lives Matter,\" Wilson said. \"As millions of people of all colors protest, I see a world of hurt, pain and despair. But I also see a new generation, a generation that is calling out in desperate need for lasting change.\"\nWilson said his white teammates and friends also need to lead.\n\"Don't just listen, help,\" he said.\nBird said Black lives need to matter outside of sports.\n\"Do Black lives matter to you when they're not throwing touchdowns?

Every athlete at every level has the power to show what it looks like to fight for what is right.\"\nWilson, Rapinoe and Bird join a growing list of athletes calling for justice for Black people killed by police.

To change the injustices. Equality is not just a word.

MLB will continue to listen to the Black community including MLB players, The Players Alliance and MLB and Club staff about this issue; enhance initiatives to improve Black representation in baseball on and off-the-field; expand charitable donations to social justice organizations; and continue to amplify the voices of our players.\"\nThe league has also reversed its policy on messages written on player cleats. According to the document, players will now be able to, \"express themselves with social justice messages and causes,\" during the 2020 season.\nBaseball may have been one of the first professional sports leagues to integrate, but it continues to reckon with the racism of its past.\nFor decades, Major League Baseball owners colluded to prevent the signing of any Black players, who ended up forming their own leagues commonly known as the Negro Leagues. That changed in 1946, when Brooklyn Dodgers owner and general manager Branch Rickey signed Negro Leaguer Jackie Robinson, who became the first Black major leaguer in 1947.\nIn late June, the Minnesota Twins removed a statue honoring Calvin Griffith from outside the team's ballpark. Griffith had once said to a crowd he'd moved his baseball team from Washington to Minneapolis because they had fewer Black people.\nCNN's Jill Martin and Wayne L.

The night the verdict was set to be announced, Alicia Garza and some friends gathered for drinks.\nNone of them thought Zimmerman would be acquitted on all charges. But that's what happened. And Garza felt like she'd been punched in the gut, she told MSNBC.\nTaking 'Black Lives Matter' from slogan to reality\nThat night Garza woke up in the middle of the night crying. So she began writing out how she felt, in an emotional Facebook post. She wrote that she continued to be surprised \"at how little Black lives matter.\"\n\"That's really what Black Lives Matter was for me,\" Garza told MSNBC. \"And that's why I said Black people, I love you. I love us. And that our lives matter. And that we matter. And that Black lives matter.\"\nThe phrase \"Black lives matter\" inspired Garza's friend, Patrisse Cullors, to create a hashtag. Almost instantly, it went viral.\n\"I wanted it to go viral,\" Cullors, who co-founded Black Lives Matter with Garza and Opal Tometi, told CNN.\n\"On July 15th, 2013 I said that Alicia and I had created a thing called #BlackLivesMatter and we hope that it will be bigger than we can ever imagine,\" Cullors said. \"Over the last seven years we've developed more infrastructure and we've become more organized.\"\nMomentum around the movement has grown amid calls for justice following the deaths of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and George Floyd.\nThe phrase \"Black Lives Matter\" is being used now as more than just a hashtag -- it's a rallying cry. At protests, it's what many demonstrators write on their signs or chant as they march. Online, it's what many have used to spread the message against police brutality. And globally, it's being used by many to show solidarity with Black people.\nWhile many believe the movement is more accepted than it once was, others remain skeptical of what it accomplishes and question its impact.\nHere's what you need to know about the evolution of the movement, and why it matters.\nGrowth of a movement\nBlack Lives Matter is one of the most well-known organizations fighting for the well-being of Black people.\nStudies show that segregation persists in many American cities, leaving majority Black communities behind. BLM's goal, according to its website, is to eradicate anti-Blackness and create a society where Black people are able to thrive in the US.\n\"We live in a country built to keep us away from these resources that we need,\" said Kailee Scales, managing director of the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation.\nScales referenced the data. Police officers are almost four times as likely to use force on Black people than White people. Black people are also jailed at a disproportionate rate. Black Americans have lower access to health care and lack the same access to quality education.\n\"Folks in the movement have been consistently fighting to reverse that trend, to raise awareness that this is not the way we're supposed to live,\" Scales told CNN.\nSince the hashtag launched, the organization has become more formalized, taken on specific branding and branched out into nationwide chapters -- all in an attempt to solidify the group and allow them to create national campaigns while engaging the broader community.\nOrganizers put together a website, which led to the development of local chapters of BLM, first in Los Angeles in 2013 and then throughout the country, according to Scales.\nLeft to right, co-founders of BLM, Opal Tometi, Alicia Garza and Patrisse Cullors appear onstage during The New York Women's Foundation Celebrating Women Breakfast in 2015.\nAfter the protests in Ferguson, Missouri, against police brutality in 2014, the organization became more well known. In 2017 it became incorporated as the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, Inc.\nToday the network consists of 13 official chapters in the US, plus three more in Canada, according to the BLM website. Local chapters are semi-autonomous, meaning they \"do the work that makes sense\" for their communities, Scales said.\nThe structure allows the group to have an impact at all levels -- doing work both nationally and locally, she said. Each chapter works a little differently and has different focuses, depending on community needs.\nThe Chicago chapter, for example, focuses more on police accountability, while the Boston chapter does a lot of activity around mutual aid, Scales said.\nProtests in Los Angeles, after the murder of George Floyd.\nIn Los Angeles BLM activists have been at the forefront of the defund police movement, meeting with local politicians about a proposal they call the People's Budget, which would reallocate funding from the Los Angeles Police Department.\nThe group has called for defunding the police for at least five years, Black Lives Matter Los Angeles co-founder Melina Abdullah told CNN. The most recent push began in May, and at the time the chapter had little support from local politicians.\nAfter George Floyd's killing, however, the group gained momentum and received some support from a few members of the Los Angeles City Council.\nIn June, after pressure from BLMLA and massive protests, the council unanimously approved a measure to develop an unarmed model of crisis response that would replace police officers with community-based responders for nonviolent calls.\nFollowing the vote, City Councilmember Herb Wesson Jr., who authored the motion with Council President Nury Martinez, said in a tweet that he looks \"forward to continuing this work alongside\" BLMLA.\nAnd there is more work to be done, Abdullah said.\n\"(We) never thought that that (amount) was anywhere near enough,\" she told CNN. \"But it's a step forward that we forced.\"\nThe different chapters are bound by a set of guiding principles, which work to ground the individual entities.\nBut they also work together. Chapters tend to work across state lines, Abdullah told CNN. When the BLM chapter in South Bend, Indiana, was getting started, Abdullah said the group worked closely with BLMLA -- specifically comparing notes on the terms of mayors Pete Buttigieg and Eric Garcetti.\nThere's a growing call to defund the police. Here's what it means\nIt's worth noting that not every protest or demonstration is part of the Black Lives Matter network, as some may be organized by people simply using the movement's name. And not every person attending a BLM protest is a part of their local BLM chapter.\nThe movement is largely decentralized, with no one besides managing director Scales receiving pay, said Abdullah, who also works as a professor at California State University in Los Angeles.\nChapters tend to have a loose leadership structure, with a focus on on-the-ground organizing -- allowing chapters the autonomy to organize in the way they see fit.\nUntil George Floyd's death, Abdullah said BLMLA had only raised $100,000 in the last seven years, money that it used for \"the basic cost of organizing,\" things like renting rooms, making copies, printing banners and hiring unarmed security. They also try to provide limited support to families who lose members to police brutality, like aiding with funeral costs, which Abdullah said can sometimes run up to $20,000.\nAnd unless money is earmarked specifically for the local chapters, money donated through the main network goes to the larger global network, Abdullah said. Chapters can ask for a little money from the national organization, but it's not always a significant amount, she said.\nBut with donations streaming in after Floyd's death, BLMLA has more money than it has ever had.\n\"We're stepping back to take a minute and process what we should be doing with the newfound money that we've never had before,\" she said.\n'All Lives Matter' and other backlash\nWith more notoriety comes more scrutiny, and the Black Lives Matter movement has experienced its fair share of criticism.\nSome have said while they support the movement's cause, they are not a fan of its approach, contrasting some of the protests today to the peaceful ones of the civil rights movement of the 1960s.\nMany have condemned the more progressive demands of the cause, most notably the call to defund the police, which would instead invest those funds in communities, especially marginalized ones where much of the policing occurs.\nWhy saying 'All lives matter' misses the big picture\nLike Abdullah said, the call to defund the police has been a key priority of the movement for years. But as these calls increase, police unions across the country have dug in to protect their own -- even though the movement has support from organizations like Amnesty International and video evidence of officers using excessive force against protesters.\nAnd the notion still faces pushback from people on both sides of the political aisle. President Donald Trump has defended the police. Meanwhile, politicians like Gov. Tony Evers of Wisconsin, a Democrat, has said defunding goes too far.\nOthers have called the movement too radical.\nIn Arizona, Rep. Walt Blackman, a Black GOP member of the Arizona Legislature, labeled BLM a \"terrorist organization\" in an interview with Fox News Radio affiliate KFYI. He then told the Arizona Republic in a follow up interview that BLM is an \"ideology that goes against the very concepts and precepts of our principles in the United States.\"\nCritics have also responded to the phrase \"Black Lives Matter\" by coining their own slogans, such as \"All Lives Matter,\" which some argue minimizes the current struggle Black people face against systemic racism, and \"Blue Lives Matter,\" referring to the lives of police.\nTrump previously called the words \"Black Lives Matter\" a \"symbol of hate\" in a tweet criticizing New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio for \"denigrating\" Fifth Avenue in Manhattan with a BLM mural.\nStill, Michael Kazin, who studies social movements at Georgetown University, said it's surprising that the movement hasn't received more backlash. He said it's the first time in history that a movement focused on Black equality has seen this kind of support from White people.\n\"Even in the '60s, with the (March on Washington), polls at the time never had more than 15, 20% support among Whites,\" Kazin, who is also the co-editor of the democratic-socialist publication Dissent Magazine, told CNN.\nThere's been an outpouring of support from diverse populations, he said. He used Portland, Oregon, as an example, where federal officers have used tear gas and force against on majority-White protesters.\n\"We're seeing huge crowds in little cities, or even where there's hardly any Black people,\" Kazin said. \"That's new. That didn't happen in the '60s, or even in 2013.\"\nWhy people are rallying behind BLM\nIt's been said that this moment feels different. It's bigger, more mainstream. White people are protesting just as much as people of color.\nEven large corporations and brands, which may have been silent in the past, are getting involved.\nLast month NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said \"Black Lives Matter\" in an apology video, a far cry from the league's stance during the 2016-17 season, when Colin Kaepernick became increasingly vocal about police brutality to the chagrin of the league. Kaepernick has not been with a team since.\nCompanies like Peloton, Disney, Facebook and others have spoken up against racial injustice, while the CEO of Netflix donated $120 million to historically Black colleges and universities.\nTaylor Swift, who previously stayed away from anything remotely controversial, has voiced her support for the BLM movement, and even called for the removal of Confederate monuments in Tennessee. Meanwhile, Seth Rogen, Steve Carrell and others have donated to bail funds for protesters.\nHide Caption\n37 of 37\nPhotos: Protests across the globe after George Floyd's death\nFrench police clash with protesters during a Black Lives Matter protest in Paris on Saturday, June 13.\nHide Caption\n1 of 37\nWith the rise of social media in the 2010s, images showing police brutality against Black people have reached a much wider audience. Now a whole generation has grown up exposed to the issue of systemic racism.\nOr, as Minneapolis community organizer Shanene Herbert put it, the trauma.\n\"They (young people) have experienced trauma,\" she told CNN. \"Seeing your friends, your families and even yourself harassed by the police and killed by the police, it's traumatic. And they don't know what to do with that.\"\nMore people are demanding change. And BLM has been a big motivator in that shift.\nMary Westbrook, who lives in Philadelphia and participated in the city's protests in June, told CNN that she felt it was important for her to support the movement.\nThe three reasons Black Lives Matter marchers refuse to quit\nWestbrook, who is White, was among a group of demonstrators that was sprayed with tear gas. Afterward, she shared an image of herself on Twitter, noting her \"face and eyes are on fire.\"\n\"I've lived in this city for 16 years,\" the 38-year-old told CNN in a Twitter message in June. \"I am a children's librarian at the library right there on the Parkway (which is why I know the area and streets there really well). I see every day what black and other POC are dealing with in this city.\"\nIn the last seven years, BLM activists have made their message mainstream, according to Marcia Chatelain, author of \"Franchise: The Golden Arches in Black America.\"\n\"There's been a shift in the public and a willingness to engage with their ideas,\" Chatelain, an American studies professor at Georgetown University, told CNN.\nFor example, she said, \"people are willing to take a second to understand what defunding the police and prison abolition are all about.\"\nWhat the future holds\nWhen asked what she hopes for BLM's future, co-founder Cullors said she knows the movement will win.\nThe next Greatest Generation\n\"I know this because our work is full of love, healing and dignity,\" she said. \"And we center Black people's humanity and life over our death and decimation.\"\nThe task isn't an easy one. Kazin, the Georgetown professor, pointed out that the BLM movement is about power -- having power to decide how policing will look, or having power to access quality education.\nBLM signs in windows, anti-racist reading lists -- all these things are good, Kazin said. But unless they are coupled with a true shift in power and larger political solidarity efforts, little will change.\nStill, people are listening now. And Scales, like Cullors, is optimistic.\n\"At this point, we don't stop,\" she said. \"We're not able to relax. It's now the opportunity to push for the true transformation that we've been working for.\"\nCNN's Christina Zdanowicz contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/09/us/trump-tower-black-lives-matter-mural-new-york-trnd/index.html", "headline": "New York City paints Black Lives Matter mural outside Trump Tower in Manhattan", "published_date": "2020-07-09", "text": "(CNN)New York City is painting a Black Lives Matter mural on the street directly outside of Trump Tower in Midtown Manhattan.\nCity employees began painting a stretch of Fifth Avenue, just in front of the Trump Organization's headquarters, on Thursday morning.

Recent polling suggests Americans' views of police and the current protests against police brutality are changing offline, too.\nThe use of the Black Lives Matter hashtag peaked three days after George Floyd died in police custody, a Pew Research Center analysis published this week shows. #BlackLivesMatter was tweeted 8.8 million times that day, according to Pew. For the following 2 weeks, users tweeted #BlackLivesMatter an average of nearly 3.7 million times per day, Pew reported.\nThe phrase \"Black Lives Matter\" emerged first in 2013 after George Zimmerman was acquitted for the killing of Trayvon Martin. It was recognized more widely during the protests against police brutality in Ferguson, Missouri, after 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot to death by police in 2014.\nOne of the movement's guiding principles is ending \"state-sanctioned violence,\" which includes killings by police. Recent polling suggests many Americans see this view -- and the recent protests against police brutality -- as legitimate.\nA Monmouth University poll released last week found that 78% of Americans said protesters' anger after George Floyd's death was \"at least partially justified.\" And a CBS News/YouGov poll found that 57% of Americans believe police in most communities treat whites better than black people.\nBefore the nationwide police brutality protests began, the use of the hashtag peaked in summer 2016, when it was mentioned around 500,000 times daily, Pew reported. That same summer saw the deaths of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, who were both fatally shot by police in Louisiana and Minnesota respectively.\nBut even then, \"Black Lives Matter\" wasn't something that most major companies issued statements about or that politicians had painted in the streets.\nClearly, something's different now."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/14/us/black-lives-matter-immigrants-visa-status-protest-trnd/index.html", "headline": "In the Black Lives Matter movement, immigrants find themselves in a tough position", "published_date": "2020-06-14", "text": "(CNN)After the first wave of nationwide protests over George Floyd's death turned violent, immigrants on US visas who support the Black Lives Matter movement's protest faced a choice: to join the protests and jeopardize their legal status as immigrants or sit it out and save their future in the country.\nJennifer Scheurle, a German immigrant living in Bellevue on a work visa, says she has always been a politically engaged person, especially having participated in Berlin's strong protest culture prior to arriving in the United States.\nThe Black Lives Matter movement inspired her, but when things turned violent, she was forced to reconcile that with the realities of her visa status.\n\"I talked to my family and my partner about whether or not it's worth it for me to protest in person and risk the visa. We came to a conclusion that it would be detrimental to my personal well-being and my effectiveness here in the US, if I go back to Germany,\" she said.\nThe consequences of an arrest\nA foreign national in the US is allowed to participate in peaceful demonstrations or rallies and if they get arrested, the US criminal justice system ensures that they are entitled to the same constitutional protections as a US citizen.\nHowever, the immigration consequences of the arrest may be quite significant.\nTrump administration temporarily amending visa requirements for foreign workers\nIf they get detained, arrested or charged, it could be problematic, even if the charges were dropped, according to Parisa Karaahmet, an immigration attorney at Fragomen, an immigration law firm. \"They could be asked to disclose the arrest in an application for a visa or at a green card interview in the US for any immigration benefits.\"\nImmigrants like Scheurle are largely aware of how these situations could weigh heavily on their immigration status, which could curb their level of participation and their method of expressing their political opinion.\n\"This is a dilemma that immigrants are facing right now,\" says Andrea Flores, the deputy director of immigration policy for the ACLU. \"So many immigrants want to participate, but the risk is always there. It's important to protest and it's important to stay safe. But the decision is unfair to people who don't have enough protections due to their immigration status.\"\n\"Given the uncertainty that the Trump administration has placed on several visa categories, it's understandable that there is anxiety around participating in protests,\" she adds.\n'We're not breaking any law'\nSeveral immigrants discussed their concerns with CNN but declined to even go on the record for the fear of consequences.\nHowever, not all immigrants are choosing to sit it out.\nPrerna Gupta, an Indian national on a work visa, has been going to protests in her neighborhood in Brooklyn.\nHe applied for a green card. Then the FBI came calling\n\"Nothing is wrong with marching with people. We're not breaking any law,\" she said, adding that the violent protests in the past haven't really discouraged her from going.\n\"It's a thought but not a big enough thought to reconsider going to a protest.\"\nGupta says it's important for her to protest because racism is not just an American problem.\n\"I have been subjected to racism elsewhere in the world as well. When I'm protesting, I'm also protesting for a change globally,\" she said.\nShe has, however, been taking precautions while protesting. Most of it comes from what she's read on the internet, including not bringing her ID along and wearing all black clothes, so she is not easily identifiable.\nWhile Scheurle doesn't want to go to protest in person, she has been helping on the side. She started out by making protest-ready kits for demonstrators. Eventually, she got involved with local groups to help with organizing ground groups for medical attention, setting up supply chains and soliciting donations to get resources in place for helping these protests.\n\"I don't know how real the threat of helping the protests is. There is no blueprint for this and nobody can tell me if this is putting me at risk or not. I am in the grey zone so I'm trying to strike the balance between doing as much as I can and protecting my visa.\"\nUnderstanding the 'special risks'\nDivyansh Kaushik, an international student working towards a Ph.D at Carnegie Mellon University, is also not joining the protests in Pittsburgh. He is scared about the coronavirus pandemic that is still a threat across the country, and being on a student visa just completely puts protesting out of question.\nIf you're planning to take part in protests, know your rights. Read this.\n\"If things turn violent and someone points a finger at you, what would you do? There aren't any legal protections,\" he said. \"I could risk losing my [visa] status.\"\nInstead, as the vice president of external affairs at the university's graduate student assembly, Kaushik has been joining his fellow students in demanding the university adopt more inclusive policies and actions.\nThe concern is not limited to a few. Karaahmet says her law firm is getting a lot of questions from clients around this.\n\"The issues resonate irrespective of nationality or background. They want their voices heard. But they are concerned about their immigration status and want to know the scope of what their participation can look like,\" she said.\n\"A non-US citizen is perfectly entitled to participate, however, there are special risks that they just have to take into account before they make their decision about the activities they want to engage in.\"\n'I have to have these hard conversations'\nProtests are critical to the immigrant community, Flores says, and black immigrants have a stake in it, too.\n\"Because black people are over-policed, that means that additional contacts with the criminal justice system puts black immigrants at increased risk of a violation that jeopardizes their residency in the US,\" she said.\nIf any foreign nationals do find themselves in an encounter with police, a criminal defense lawyer should certainly be their first call and an immigration lawyer should come second, Karaahmet recommends.\nUltimately, Kaushik says, a lot of his decisions hinge on his visa status. \"I just try to err on the side of caution.\"\nAnd Scheurle chooses to think about the people who want her to stay in the US.\n\"I have to have these hard conversations with people around me who want me to stay.

This movement has spread on social media, where organizations, brands and individuals are posting solemn messages featuring stark black backgrounds, sometimes tagging the posts with #BlackLivesMatter.\nMusic industry leaders vow to pause business for a day in observation of Blackout Tuesday\nHere's the problem. While these posts may be well-intended, several activists and influencers have pointed out that posting a blank black image with a bunch of tags clogs up critical channels of information and updates. Protests are still raging around the country. Arrests are piling up by the thousands. Visibility for different groups and activist projects are key right now. And one of the most common ways to keep track of all of this is by monitoring or searching tags.\n\"We know that's it no intent to harm but to be frank, this essentially does harm the message,\" mental health advocate and Black Lives Matter activist Kenidra Woods posted on Twitter. \"We use hashtag to keep ppl updated. PLS stop using the hashtag for black images!!\" A video scroll of the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag on Instagram proves her point: It's row after row of black squares, with very few posts of note in between.\nDon't use the #BlackLivesMatter tag, activists say\nThere are two issues here: One, the actual tags used on Blackout Tuesday posts. Two, the actual purpose of posting a black image in the first place.\nWhen you post an image with a tag on, say, Twitter or Instagram, it gets automatically added to a searchable feed, which people can find using that tag. It's a common way for people to monitor a situation or interest. And since people have been including the #BlackLivesMAtter tag, in the words of activist Feminista Jones, the protests have been erased from Instagram.\n\"When you check the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag, it's no longer videos, helpful information, resources, documentation of the injustice, it's rows of black screens,\" music artist Kehlani explained on her Instagram story.\nPeople want to keep the information flowing\n'My emotions were so raw': The people creating art to remember George Floyd\nBlackout Tuesday gained traction from the work of music executives Jamila Thomas and Brianna Agyemang, who led an effort in the music community to pause normal business operations on June 2nd \"in observance of the long-standing racism and inequality that exists from the boardroom to the boulevard.\"\nAs the movement grew, the notion filtered down to individuals and brands who have vowed to not post any content on June 2nd in deference to the situation.\nHowever, there's concern that while what amounts to a virtual moment of silence may be a powerful reminder to some, it comes at a time when the voices of black activists and advocates are needed the most.\nRapper Lil Nas X was critical of the movement on Twitter. \"I just really think this is the time to push as hard as ever,\" he wrote. \"I don't think the movement has ever been this powerful. we don't need to slow it down by posting nothing. we need to spread info and be as loud as ever.\"\nHowever, some people have taken the call to action to mean a pause on posting about personal things or issues unrelated to Black Lives Matter or the ongoing protests rather than complete silence.

In 2014, he worked on a project showcasing what 10 hours of street harassment in New York City looked like for women, which was criticized at the time for only featuring minorities and little to no White individuals.

They are seen brandishing the weapons as demonstrators walked outside the home, protesting Mayor Lyda Krewson's decision to publish the names and addresses of people in favor of police reform. Portland Place, the private street where McCloskey lives, is near Krewson's home.\nMcCloskey told CNN the mayor's house cannot be reached through his neighborhood and that hundreds of protesters broke through a private gate. He said the protesters threatened to kill him and his dogs and burn his house down.\nIn two eyewitness videos, it appears the McCloskeys and protesters exchange words, but it's unclear what is said.\nMcCloskey said his actions and those of his wife were justified.\n\"My clients are completely behind and endorsed the message of BLM,\" McCloskey's attorney Albert S. Watkins said. \"What they are not capable of doing is embracing the abject utilization of that noble message that we all need to hear over and over and over again as a license to rape, rob, pillage bowl over all of our rights.\"\nDetails of the protests contested\nMcCloskey said he stopped seeing the gathering as a protest when he alleges the protesters broke through a wrought iron gate.\nDaniel Shular, a local reporter who took one of the videos obtained by CNN and said he watched the entire roughly 10-minute long incident unfold, said a door next to the gate at Portland Place was unlocked and protesters used that to cut through the neighborhood.\nIn a video livestreamed on Facebook, the left gate door is held open by the first protesters that enter the private street. That video does not show how the door was first opened.\nHowever, a second Facebook Live video taken later shows the right gate door bent and broken on the ground.\nSt. Louis couple pulls firearms on protesters cutting through their private street\nMcCloskey exits the house 20 seconds later, and both videos show a heated, often profane back and forth between the couple and the protesters.\nOnce through the gate, (the McCloskeys) advised the group that they were \"on a private street and trespassing and told them to leave,\" according to police. The couple told police the group began yelling obscenities and threatened to harm them.\n\"When the victims observed multiple subjects who were armed, they then armed themselves and contacted police,\" states the report.\nShular recounted to CNN that he did see some armed people at the protest but that \"no one drew their guns on the people from the house.\"\nThe St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department told CNN it is investigating the incident. Circuit Attorney for the city Kimberly M. Gardner told CNN in a statement that she was alarmed by the events and her office is investigating.\n\"We must protect the right to peacefully protest, and any attempt to chill it through intimidation or threat of deadly force will not be tolerated,\" she said in her statement. \"Make no mistake: we will not tolerate the use of force against those exercising their First Amendment rights, and will use the full power of Missouri law to hold people accountable.\"\nWhat led up to the protests\nThe protesters passing through Portland Place were headed to Krewson's house, bypassing nearby road closures that blocked access to the mayor's home.\nThey were spurred by her reading the names and addresses of people asking for police reform. The names and home addresses she read were submitted as part of public comments to the St. Louis County Council.\nCalls for resignation mount after St. Louis mayor releases names of individuals calling for police reform\nFriday, the mayor apologized on Twitter, saying she didn't mean to hurt anyone.\n\"I'd like to apologize for identifying individuals who presented letters to me at City Hall today.

Jackie Lacey will go!\"\nTheir mission has intensified in the wake of George Floyd's death and resulting nationwide protests. But unlike other Black Lives Matter targets -- including police brutality often at the hands of White officers -- their aim is on Los Angeles County's first Black and female district attorney, a homegrown prosecutor raised in South L.A.\nProtesters gather outside Lacey's office in downtown Los Angeles.\n\"They think they're going to sweep all this sh*t under the rug like it never happened,\" shouted Fouzia Almarou, the mother of Kenneth Ross, Jr., who was shot dead by a Gardena police officer in 2018.\n\"I'm here standing tall!\" Almarou yelled from a stage as she turned around to hurl expletives toward the Los Angeles County Hall of Justice, which houses the office of District Attorney Jackie Lacey. Her office had cleared the Gardena police officer of wrongdoing and ruled the shooting was justified.\nOne after another, nearly a dozen parents of dead children took to the microphone to blame Lacey, a Democrat, for what they see as an unwillingness to prosecute police officers.\n\"Killer cops ain't funny!\" the crowd chanted in unison. \"Bye Jackie 2020!\"\n\"It's surreal,\" Lacey said of the weekly protests against her. \"It's almost like an out-of-body experience.\"\nIn her first in-depth interview since Black Lives Matter stepped up its campaign to oust her, Lacey tells CNN she has more in common with protesters than they realize, and that in many of these cases, she's handcuffed by the law.\n\"While you may look at a shooting by an officer and say, 'Oh, they could have shot him in the leg, they didn't have to respond that way,' that's not the test under California law,\" Lacey said. \"The test is when somebody's life is in danger.\"\nStill, the pressure on Lacey since George Floyd's death in Minneapolis has been unrelenting. So much so, that Burbank Congressman Adam Schiff, a high-profile Democrat, pulled his support for her, tweeting that his endorsement of Lacey a year ago no longer \"has the same meaning.\"\n\"I don't know why he pulled his support, but I have heard from electeds that they're being threatened via emails,\" Lacey said. \"People are showing up at electeds' houses late at night, protesting them.\"\nIt happened to Lacey, too. But on that early morning, protesters wound up at gunpoint.\nProtestors take their grievances to Lacey's house\nIt was still dark when Melina Abdullah led a group of protesters to Lacey's home on an early morning in March. It was a bold move, but the co-founder of Black Lives Matter L.A. felt she had little choice.\n\"We've been standing in front of her office, demanding that she meet with us for two and a half years and she refused to come out,\" Abdullah said. \"What alternative is there?\"\nLacey said she has offered to meet in smaller groups after an early town hall-style meeting led to shouting.\n\"When it's a large group, there's no dialogue; it's you yelling at me and hoping that I'll react poorly,\" Lacey said, noting that people film the exchanges with their cell phones.\nThat \"caught on camera\" moment, however, played out at her home, only that it was her husband on the video.\nL.A.'s district attorney's husband pulls gun on protesters. 01:17\n\"Good morning\" Abdullah said to David Lacey, who was pointing a gun at her and others.\n\"Get off of my porch!\" he replied sternly.\n\"Are you going to shoot me?\" Abdullah asked.\n\"I will shoot you, get off of my porch!\" David Lacey said.\n\"I don't care who you are, get off of my porch!\" he replied sternly.\n\"Can you tell Jackie Lacey that we're here?\" Abdullah replied.\n\"I don't care who you are, get off of my porch right now! We're calling the police right now,\" David Lacey said as he closed the door.\nLacey said she didn't know her husband was going to the door, and that the moment felt like \"utter chaos.\"\n\"We were both asleep and I just called 911, I didn't know what was about to happen,\" Lacey said. \"As district attorney, you realize that a lot of people may want to... do away with you because you're prosecuting them.\"\nAt a press conference later that day, Lacey apologized on behalf of her family. She told CNN that coming to her home \"crossed the line.\"\n\"Creating a situation where someone thinks that they're about to be harmed, I don't think that helps your cause at all,\" Lacey said.\nBut Abdullah disagrees, saying \"people have been going to elected officials' houses for decades,\" and that it is all in the quest for social change.\nMelina Abdullah, co-founder of Black Lives Matter Los Angeles, seen in a white shirt, leads a protest in front of Lacey's office on July 1.\n\"She doesn't get to hide just because she lives out in kind of suburbia,\" Abdullah said, arguing that public officials give up some of their privacy when they become public servants.\nThe fundamental disagreement over this issue is indicative of the broader chasm between Lacey's approach to her job and the expectations of protesters. They want stark change to correct what they see as generations of pain brought on by a broken criminal justice system that victimizes people of color.\nLacey doesn't disagree with that, she says, but she views change as something that can occur by fixing the criminal justice system, not dismantling it.\n\"If you're talking about redistributing funds, I absolutely agree with that,\" Lacey said of her view on defunding the police.\n\"I've advocated for mental health funds to go to communities of color since 2013. I've been advocating for treatment of drug addiction for a long time. But if you're talking about, let's just take all the police out of our community and if a crime happens, just let someone else respond, I just don't think that's realistic.\"\nWhile other politicians, including Adam Schiff, marched with protesters in the wake of George Floyd's death, Lacey's refusal to pick up a bullhorn has created the appearance that she hasn't laid bare her true allegiance. Black Lives Matter views her ambitions as \"narrow,\" ineffective and favoring the police.\n\"We wanted to be open to thinking about how can we allow her to be a more progressive district attorney and act in the interests of Black people as a whole,\" Abdullah said of their initial approach to Lacey. \"When you have somebody who is Black, it doesn't always mean they carry the interests of all Black people.\"\n\"They're treating me like 'the man,'\" Lacey said. \"But if they only knew that I'm the girl from the neighborhood.\"\nFrom South L.A. to a seat of power\nLacey grew up in the Crenshaw district of South Los Angeles, born to parents who moved from the South.\n\"They talked to me at an early age about Jim Crow and racism,\" she recalled.\nLacey was born in Los Angeles to parents who moved from the South.\nA graduate of the University of Southern California Law School, her seminal case as a prosecutor was tried in front of famed judge Lance Ito -- an early use of L.A. County's hate crimes law that led to convictions for the beating death of a homeless man.\n\"I actually went to law school to figure out how I could help people who didn't know their rights and didn't know the law,\" Lacey said.\nBecoming L.A.'s first Black DA since the office was formed in 1850 seemed like a win for the community when Lacey took office in 2012.\nLacey, front row, third from right, with an incoming group of prosecutors hired under former D.A. Ira Reiner, center.\n\"I get in here and the most vocal group who wants to take me out is a group known as Black Lives Matter,\" Lacey said.\nIt is opposition the group says is necessary given the current climate.\n\"As a Black woman, I would rather be celebrating other Black women, and I do,\" Abdullah said. \"My allegiance is to Black people, not to an individual Black person who wouldn't mind selling us out.\"\nLacey has a hard time rationalizing that approach. Now 63, she says her upbringing gives her a much different view of Los Angeles than that of younger protesters.\n\"I remember when my parents' home was broken into and they put bars on the window,\" she said, adding that her top priority as a youth was \"just getting home safely\" on her walks to and from Dorsey High School.\n\"People don't realize in the seventies and eighties how dangerous it was in Los Angeles,\" she said. \"I remember when (my parents) used to complain that police don't care about our neighborhood.\"\nThat's why she doesn't take a poisonous view to the institution of policing, she said. But her opponents see her as catering to police, especially since as the district attorney of the largest jurisdiction in the nation, it is her job to potentially prosecute police officers who use excessive force.\nBlack Lives Matter has created \"Jackie Lacey's Seven Deadly Sins,\" a list of what they see as her most egregious affronts to the Black community. They include disproportionately pursuing the death penalty against defendants of color and relying on the testimony of corrupt cops.\nBut number one on that list: Ed Buck, a Democratic political donor and a resident of West Hollywood.\n'How many disadvantaged Black men have to die...?'\nBuck, a White gay man, allegedly invited a Black man to his home for sex and plied him with drugs until his death. The case was fodder for rumor, until he was accused of doing it a second time. That's when activists began to question whether it was criminal.\n\"How many disadvantaged Black men have to die before Jackie Lacey will prosecute this Democratic donor?\" they asked.\n\"I didn't know him. He gave a minuscule amount to my campaign. I think a hundred dollars,\" Lacey said. \"We gave it back.\"\nThen it happened a third time, only this time the man escaped Buck's apartment and called police. Protesters outside Buck's home got their wish -- charges were filed against him, including for battery and administering methamphetamine. Federal charges of distributing meth were added later, for which Buck will face trial next year.\nLacey said she didn't cave to protesters; rather, it took that long for the evidence to fit the law.\n\"When we got that third person who lived, then we were able to file a case,\" Lacey said, arguing that the first two cases were ambiguous.\n\"It reminds me of the John Belushi story. There was a woman who supplied him with drugs, he overdosed, and people wanted the DA to charge her with a crime,\" Lacey said. \"Ed Buck is similar in the sense of here were men who used drugs that Ed Buck supplied, but we don't know whether he injected them or they injected themselves.\"\nThat attention to legal detail offers insight into Lacey's methodical approach to her position. It also explains why Lacey and protesters are fractured over another topic: police shootings.\n'No matter who you have in this job, they still have to follow California law'\nLacey and Black Lives Matter are so far off on the topic of police shootings in Los Angeles County that they can't even agree on how many there have been.\nBlack Lives Matter has compiled a list of more than 600 people killed by police since Lacey took office in 2012. Lacey puts the number at about 340.\nBoth sides agree either number is too many, but Lacey touts another figure she says must be considered: \"14 or 15 of those shootings\" involved citizens who were unarmed, she said.\n\"I can't tell you how many times I'll look at a case on television and say, okay, this is coming my way. Let's see what it's about,\" Lacey said. \"And I open the book and I say, 'Oh, no one mentioned that the guy had a gun, or the woman had a knife.'\"\nAccording to an official tally by her office, Lacey has reviewed 252 fatal shootings through May 2020. One of those cases resulted in charges against an L.A. County sheriff's deputy. The rest were declined.\nLacey said that's because the law leaves her with little wiggle room when a citizen is armed and it can be argued the officer was in danger at the time they pulled the trigger.\nLacey at a news conference on June 29, 2015.\n\"No matter who you have in this job, they still have to follow California law,\" she said.\nBut Black Lives Matter points to Lacey's support from police unions as a reason to be suspicious, since unions are largely seen as an obstacle to effective police reform.\nLacey says she is generally pro-union, which makes her liked by more than just police.\nShe boast nearly 20 endorsements from unions and trade associations, including the L.A. County Federation of Labor.\n\"But they are not in here making the decisions,\" she argues.\nAside from shootings, Lacey said she has still filed charges against 200 police officers or sheriff's deputies for various other on and off-duty behaviors. And her long-stated goal has been to keep people from coming in contact with police, she said.\n\"Why are police called out for a mental health crisis? Shouldn't that be a social worker?\" she asks. \"Why is someone called out if someone is homeless and trespassing? And what can we do to get more people off the streets to discourage people from committing crimes to reduce recidivism?\"\nThose statements may sound similar to those of protesters, but the gap appears too wide for ground to be made up before the November election.\n\"Unless Jackie Lacey were willing to bring charges in all 609 cases of those who were killed by police, yeah, it's too late,\" Abdullah said. \"She has proven over the last seven years who she is.\"\n'My next term will be my last'\nBlack Lives Matter doesn't make endorsements, but their call to oust Lacey can only benefit Lacey's challenger, George Gasc\u00f3n. That's why it's ironic that he's a former Los Angeles police officer and assistant chief, and more recently San Francisco's district attorney.\nBut that doesn't mean he wouldn't face the same scrutiny as Lacey, since Black Lives Matter considers the system ripe for the \"over-criminalization of people of color and poor people.\"\nLacey in 2017.\n\"And so, no matter who occupies the office, there's going to be a problem with the office itself,\" Abdullah said.\nDespite years of protests, Lacey still enjoys broad Democratic support and nearly won a third term outright, getting just shy of the 50% of votes needed to avoid a general election.\nBut that was before George Floyd.\nL.A. mayor Eric Garcetti has left his prior endorsement of Lacey ambiguous, conceding to a criminal justice reform website that \"it may be\" time for a change.\nThough Gasc\u00f3n did not receive the endorsement of San Francisco mayor London Breed, where he served as DA, he has been backed by L.A. County's Democratic party and Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.\nNo matter how the election turns out, Lacey tells CNN \"my next term will be my last.\"\nI think I'm going to care less about what people say and more about... how I want this book to end,\" she said. \"I want to see less juveniles in our... system, less people on the streets.\n\"I don't want it to end like this, right?\" she continued. \"That as the first African American to hold this job, and protesters ran her out. That doesn't seem like a just ending.\"\nClarification: This story has been updated to include George Gasc\u00f3n's political endorsements."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/25/us/hijab-removed-booking-photo-black-lives-matter-trnd/index.html", "headline": "A Muslim woman says her headscarf was forcibly removed from her head for a booking photo after being arrested at a Black Lives Matter protest", "published_date": "2020-06-25", "text": "(CNN)An 18-year-old Muslim woman arrested at a Black Lives Matter protest in Miami says her hijab was forcibly removed from her head for a booking photograph and she was not allowed to put it back on for several hours.\nAlaa Massri was arrested at a protest June 10, according to the Miami Police Department, and charged with battery, resisting an officer with violence and disorderly conduct.

She was not allowed to put her hijab back on for what she estimated to be around seven hours.\nMassri speaks at another Black Lives Matter protest.\nMiami-Dade County Corrections and Rehabilitation, the agency responsible for booking and mugshots, did not respond to CNN's repeated requests for comment.\nMassri's booking photo, which showed her without her hijab, was then distributed to several news outlets and began circulating on social media, according to Wahid.\n\"The damage from that cannot be undone,\" Wahid told CNN. \"That photograph is out there forever. This was a humiliating experience for her. Not just the arrest, but that her religious rights were violated.\"\nWahid filed an inquiry to the Miami-Dade County Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation's legal department, seeking additional information about what happened and the names of the officers involved, but has not received a response, he said Tuesday.\n\"I'm hoping that they respond to our request, but if they do not we will escalate it beyond basic communications,\" Wahid told CNN. \"We've also made an inquiry with their legal department.\"\n'They consciously took away her rights'\nAfter her hijab was removed for the booking photo, Massri said, she was made to spend hours without her hijab in the presence of multiple men.\nThis \"completely disrespect(ed) her way of life,\" reads a Change.org petition started by Massri a week ago. \"They consciously took away her rights to be a woman practicing Islam and spread an image she never thought would be out in the world.\"\nThe petition, which has been signed by more than 125,000 people by Tuesday night, asks for all charges against Massri to be dropped, for her mugshot to be \"taken down,\" and for the officers involved to be investigated.\nAccording to the Miami-Dade County Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, there are policies in place to protect people who practice religious beliefs.\n\"Arrestees who claim or appear to be of a particular faith are allowed to keep their head covering once it has been searched for contraband and the booking photograph has been taken,\" a spokesperson for Miami-Dade Corrections said in a statement to CNN affiliate WSVN.\n\"We are committed to ensuring that individuals' faith-based beliefs and practices are respected and will review this incident to ensure compliance with our policies and this commitment.\"\nHowever, Massri was not searched in a private room and the hijab was forcibly removed from her head while men were present, a violation of both her privacy and religious freedoms, according to Wahid.\n\"They should have allowed her to keep her hijab on,\" Wahid said. \"They can easily do a search in a private room with a same-sex officer. There is absolutely no reason not to give her back her hijab after the search or there to be a booking photo without her hijab on. Either the officers ignored the policy in place or the policy is simply not strong enough.\"\nMassri takes part in the Miami protest shortly before her arrest.\nForcibly removing the hijab from her head was a \"complete disregard\" of a central part of her faith and could also be a legal violation, said Omar Saleh, a lawyer for the Council of American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), which has not been asked to assist in Massri's case.\n\"The arrest which results in the removal of a hijab during booking and prolonged removal of the hijab is a legal issue and severe violation, not just of the 1st and 14th Amendment, but also the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act,\" Saleh told CNN. \"Forcing a woman to remove her hijab causes humiliation, mental anguish and distress.\"\nIn 2018, the New York Police Department was ordered to pay $180,000 to three Muslim women after forcing them to remove their hijabs for booking photos, the New York Daily News reported.\nAnother Minnesota woman received a $120,000 settlement in 2019 after she was forced to remove her hijab following an arrest over a traffic violation, The Star Tribune reported. The jail also implemented new rules regarding proper procedures on how to accommodate inmates with religious headwear.\nLinda Sarsour, a political activist and Muslim woman in New York who also wears a hijab, has been arrested during protests several times. Sarsour said an officer once tried to force her to take off her hijab during the booking process, but she said it seemed mainly to be an issue of a lack of proper training.\n\"For effective police work, it doesn't make sense to ask Muslim women to take off their hijabs. For every way we are identified by the government, whether it's our passports, driver's license, Costco cards, college ID, you name it, this is how we look all the time in public,\" Sarsour told CNN.\n\"It's illogical for police departments to want Muslim women to take off their hijab because that is not the way we show up in the world. The idea of the database is that the mugshot goes in the database, and if you commit a crime again that database is used to identify you. So how are you going to identify us if the way we show up in your database is not how we show up in the rest of the world?\"\nTo force a Muslim woman to remove her hijab for a photo is \"dehumanizing and humiliating and strips you of your dignity,\" she added.\nAn employee at Chicken Express was sent home for refusing to take off her hijab\nThe death of George Floyd, a handcuffed Black man, while in Minneapolis police custody has triggered protests across the country, including the protest where Massri was arrested along with six others.\nAt one point during the protest, police attempted to \"form a skirmish line\" to block protesters from taking over the street, according to an arrest affidavit obtained by CNN. At the time of her arrest, Massri, who says she was rushing to help an injured protester, was confronted by multiple police in riot gear, she said in the petition.\nThe incident report also alleges that Massri hit an officer \"in the right bicep with a closed fist\" after he \"grabbed\" her to escort her out of the street after she refused orders to get out of the road. Massri was charged with battery, resisting an officer with violence and disorderly conduct.\n\"The officer is incorrect. If she unintentionally waved her hand and it made contact, that is not a crime,\" Wahid said.\n\"We are defending her criminal charges, which we strongly believe she committed no battery on a police office and did not intentionally strike the officer.

They said that they heard the same responses from management that they always hear, with leadership pointing to continued efforts to hire people of color and how this was a needed conversation.\nThe letter followed as a response to both the headline and broader problems, they told CNN.

Hughes confirmed in her email that no employees would lose any paid time off if they called out sick Thursday.\nWhen asked about newsroom demographics, Benn told CNN in an email that the newspaper employs 213 journalists, 57 of whom, or 26.8%, are people of color. He also noted that seven of the newsroom's first eight new hires in 2020 were journalists of color.\nHughes' email to staff also addressed the importance the Inquirer's journalists have in reporting news for all communities.\n\"Black lives matter, and we know that we have a critical role to play in making sure that the work we do every day reflects the community we serve.

We understand that clearly goes against the demands for systemic police reform,\" the statement reads.\nLA Pride referred CNN to another statement published on Monday, announcing they will no longer be involved in organizing the June 14 event, which is now called the All Black Lives Matter march, but they are \"in full support.\"\nPolice and Pride events\nPolice presence at Pride events is being reconsidered by organizers around the country.\nIndy Pride in Indianapolis, which announced this week it will hold a June 20 virtual event \"to uplift black and brown people,\" also specified in their statement that they will no longer contract with or utilize police departments for security, and if their presence will be necessary, \"they will provide support to block traffic as mandated by the city, but will not participate in the event.\"\nRELATED: How lavender became a symbol of LGBTQ resistance\n\"Indy Pride is meant to be a safe place where people celebrate LGBTQ+ uniqueness, history, and build community.

Named the \"Queer Liberation March for Black Lives and Against Police Brutality,\" the march will take place in Manhattan on June 28, on the anniversary of the Stonewall riots.\nTo protect participants from the risk of catching coronavirus, organizers plan to offer masks, gloves and hand sanitizers to participants. Trained community members will help enforce social distancing guidelines, according to Barjon, and the event will be livestreamed for those who wouldn't feel safe being physically present.\nStephanie Augello/Shutterstock\nIn terms of coordinating with local Black Lives Matter activists, Barjon says her group is busy doing that outreach work.\n\"We are aware of what's happening with LA Pride. Your intention might be to do something good, but we have to make sure the impact is what we want it to be, and that the right voices are getting uplifted,\" Barjon told CNN.\nSustaining the momentum\nBarjon told CNN that centering black and brown voices during Pride has always been a priority for the Reclaim Pride Coalition, and while this moment is bringing this issue to the fore for many more, \"it always should have been at the forefront for everyone.\"\nBarjon is both encouraged and cautious about the momentum generated by the protests across the country.\n\"Part of me feels like (people) are arriving at the place we've been trying to get them to for years,\" she said.\nTalking to older mentors about their experiences though, Barjon, 24, said \"it's hard to hope that this will be the time that it sustains.\"\n\"We need more than 'Black Lives Matter.'

In 1917, nearly 10,000 demonstrators in New York City wore white as they participated in the NAACP's Silent Protest Parade, one of the first public demonstrations of civil rights by black Americans.\n\"We felt that was a really powerful way to think about our action in relation to a lot of others and how thinking on the metaphor of like silence equals death and how everything comes together,\" Tirado, a queer writer and producer, told CNN.\n\"In the 1917 Silent Parade the men wore black while women and children wore white,\" co-organizer West Dakota explained in a statement following the protest. \"The decision to wear white was to symbolize our unity, and also to take a stand against corporate appropriation of the rainbow flag. We don't need rainbow (merchandise) to show our pride.\"\nThe role of organizer in times of civil unrest has most often been filled by the same black and brown people who themselves are facing violence and mistreatment, Tirado said.\nIt was important to Sunday's organizers -- a group made up primarily of queer people of color, both black and non-black -- that the legwork of organizing be done by non-trans folks, while keeping the spotlight on the partnering trans activists and organizations.\n\"This collective of folks is particularly powerful because it's modeling what is possible when you do have allies and folks who do care and also want to make sure that they're building something that speaks to the hearts of the actual people that they're representing,\" Willis told CNN in an interview. \"So often that doesn't happen.\"\nMelania Brown, the sister of Layleen Polanco, was among the speakers at the New York rally on Sunday. Polanco, an AfroLatinx transgender woman, died in June of 2019 while being held in solitary confinement following an epileptic seizure at Riker's Island.\n\"Black trans lives matter,\" Brown told the crowd. \"My sister's life mattered. All of the loved ones we have lost, all of these beautiful girls that we have lost. There lives matter. We have to protect them.\"\nProtest partners were all trans-based support organizations\nWhile Sunday's protest came in response to the murders of Fells and Milton, organizers emphasized the necessity to fight for trans lives beyond seeking post-mortem justice.\nLike Fells and Milton, the majority of trans people killed are black women. Ninety-one percent of the reported murders of trans and gender non-conforming people in 2019 were black women, and 81% were under the age of 30, according to the Human Rights Campaign, which tracks reported killings.\nViolence against the transgender community often goes unreported or misreported, as a result of authorities, media reports, and family members misidentifying the dead, the Human Rights Campaign said.\nLGBTQ communities are elevating black voices during Pride Month in solidarity\nDeadnaming is the term used to refer to the use of a trans person's birth name in place of their chosen name, as has been the case for Riah Milton, who was deadnamed and misgendered by the Butler County Sheriff's Office in a press conference last Thursday. CNN has reached out to the sheriff's office, which is handling the case, for request for comment.\nAll of the partners in Sunday's protest are trans-based support organizations that provide both immediate and longterm assistance to trans people, organizers said.\nThe Okra Project delivers free meals to trans and gender non-conforming individuals who are experiencing food insecurity. Gays and Lesbians Living In a Transgender Society (G.L.I.T.S) facilitates assistance, including health care and housing, for transgender sex workers.

The 22-year-old forward was also the only player seen not wearing a \"Black Lives Matter\" shirt.\nIsaac can be seen wearing his Magic game jersey instead.\nHe explained his position on Friday ahead of the game versus the Brooklyn Nets, saying that he doesn't think \"putting that shirt on and kneeling went hand-in-hand with supporting Black lives.\"\nCovering the weirdest basketball season ever from inside the NBA bubble\n\"For me Black lives are supported through the gospel.

The statement did not allude to Isaac's decision to stand.\n\"The DeVos Family and the Orlando Magic organization fully supports Magic players who have chosen to leverage their professional platform to send a peaceful and powerful message condemning bigotry, racial injustice and the unwarranted use of violence by police, especially against people of color,\" the statement said.\nNo sex and no fans, but the beer is flowing fast in the NBA 'bubble'\nIt added, \"We are proud of the positive impact our players have made and join with them in the belief that sports can bring people together -- bridging divides and promoting inclusion, equality, diversity and unity.

Created by Leah Asmelash and Brandon Tensley, this newsletter hopes to offer a window into how history can, and should, inform people's lives.\nBut this isn't a dry history textbook. Our aim is to help readers engage in the challenging conversations on race by introducing them to more contemporary pieces of culture that will entertain and illuminate as much as they educate and inform.\nFor this week, we highlight Hulu removing a supposed blackface episode, revisit Martin Luther King Jr.'s final essay and take a look at the BET Awards, which were exactly what we needed.\nThis week in culture\nLeah: Did you hear about Hulu pulling that episode of \"The Golden Girls,\" with \"blackface\"? Any thoughts?\nBrandon: Yes! I did hear about that -- and I think that it's BANANAS.\nL: OK, explain! So many TV shows have been doing this. What makes GG different?\nB: For one, in that particular GG episode, the characters -- Rose and Blanche -- aren't actually in blackface. They're wearing mud masks and freak out because they think that somebody might mistake the masks for blackface. The episode is about white anxiety when it comes to race.\nHulu's decision seems like a reflexive one instead of a rigorous one that might prod audiences to think more deeply about race, or about the enduring impact and influence of cultural artifacts.\nL: Right! It just feels like Hulu missed the point? They're pulling the episode because they think that it'll get backlash, without doing any real grappling with the issue. Kind of like ... the NBA saying that it will paint Black Lives Matter on its courts?\nB: Lordt. Yeah, I sort of rolled my eyes when I read that announcement. It's not that visible signs of solidarity aren't important. It's that, too often, that's where support for a marginalized community ends -- with a cute gesture. I'm curious to see if the NBA, which historically has been a very activist-minded organization, supports the Black Lives Matter movement in other, more substantial ways. But what are your thoughts?\nL: I agree. So much of this moment feels super performative to me. Some NBA players have asked not to resume the season in light of the protests, and yet the commissioner is forging ahead -- ignoring these complaints (presumably because of money). There's also a lot of dark irony in the fact that the majority-Black NBA will be exposing its players to the coronavirus on courts that literally say that their lives matter. It's like the NBA is activist-y when it suits it. Kind of like how that Houston realtor group said that it'd stop using the phrase \"master\" in reference to bedrooms and bathrooms, when that's not really the main problem people are worried about.\nB: Are there any other recent examples that jump out at you as cringey?\nL: WHERE TO BEGIN. I'm a sports fan, so I keep going back to the Washington NFL team, which is quite literally named after a Native slur. On Black Out Tuesday, they released their little statement saying that Black Lives Matter, but if they truly believed that Black lives matter, they should believe that Native lives matter, too. Which makes me think: How can you say BLM when your name is a slur? One doesn't match the other.\nB: My pessimistic takeaway from all this is that these sorts of moves are more about protecting brands than about supporting lives. Show is nice. Substance is better. As so many people have been saying, this moment feels different. Hopefully the responses from organizations will be different, too.\n'A Testament of Hope'\nIf you think that the ongoing protests are just about police killing Black men and women, you're missing the point. They're about so much more: about ending mass incarceration, about investing in housing programs. You can't separate one from the other.\nA good place to start to understand how everything is interconnected is with this essay from Martin Luther King Jr., \"A Testament of Hope,\" which made the same point in 1968. Because, alas, we've been fighting the same fight for more than half a century.\n\"The black revolution is much more than a struggle for the rights of Negroes,\" King wrote. \"It is forcing America to face all its interrelated flaws -- racism, poverty, militarism and materialism. It is exposing evils that are rooted deeply in the whole structure of our society.\"\nIn addition to revealing the radical dimensions of a civil rights icon who's often flattened to his non-violence mantra, the essay helps us to understand why the current Black Lives Matter protests, fueled by years of organizing, feel so impactful.\nFollowing the police killing of George Floyd in May, demonstrators haven't just been condemning the latest manifestation of American racism; they've been aiming at, to use King's own words, the very roots of social control. They're aware that advocating for Black Americans can't be teased apart from, say, ending police militarization, or from investing in economic justice broadly. King reminds us that it's here, in this expansive vision of liberation, where hope lies -- where the most momentous change starts.\nRecommended for your eyes and ears\nFor the last week, we've had Beyonc\u00e9's \"Black Parade\" on repeat. It's not just because it's a defiant celebration of Blackness (that's expected from Beyonc\u00e9). It's also because every listen is a revelation. Each reference -- to a Baobab tree, to an ankh charm -- sends you on a journey to learn more (if you don't already know) or to appreciate (if you do).\nIf you're interested in the rigorous study of race, you're hopefully already familiar with the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones.

Young Asian Americans are increasingly engaging in difficult conversations with their parents and community about uprooting their anti-black sentiments and supporting African Americans.\nKang decided to help by joining the \"Letters for Black Lives\" project and translating the open letter into Korean.\nThe letter was written in 2016 after the shooting of Philando Castile, a black man who died during a routine traffic stop. Recently, however, it has been rewritten to include Floyd's death and to better reflect the current state of the nation.\n\"Mom, Dad, Uncle, Auntie, Grandfather, Grandmother,\" the English version of the letter begins. \"We need to talk. You may not have many Black friends, colleagues, or acquaintances, but I do. Black people are a fundamental part of my life: they are my friends, my neighbors, my family. I am scared for them.\"\nLetters for Black Lives have been translated into over two dozen languages.\nKang is one of the more than 330 people who helped translate the letter into 26 languages, including Chinese, Japanese, Khmer, Lao, Nepali, Tagalog and Burmese. Each version varies because translators have incorporated different racial issues that are specific to their communities.\n\"The whole spirit behind this is that it is very much a template for how to help other people have these conversations,\" said Adrienne Mahsa Varkiani, one of the project's administrators who translated the letter into Persian. \"We really encouraged translators to make it something that makes sense for your community.\"\nThe letter directed at South Asians mentions their own feelings of discrimination and violence after 9/11, \"When members of our community were blamed for 'bringing terrorism.'\"\nThe Korean letter acknowledges the \"protest and struggle\" felt by South Korea under 35 years of colonial rule by Japan.\nBut all the letters connect these different experiences of oppression to African Americans and the sometimes violent discrimination they face.\n\"The Asian American community does not experience the systemic racism that the black community faces,\" Kang said. \"I acknowledge that these conversations are difficult and hard to have within our own homes... (But) we are still in a position of privilege that it's a choice to have these discussions, whereas black families need to have these conversations because of safety and real lived experiences.\"\nThe letters have been shared widely on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. And both Kang and Varkiani say they have heard stories of how the letters have opened up this difficult dialogue between different generations.\nYulan Lin, a software engineer from California, shared the letter with her grandfather, who grew up in Japanese-occupied Taiwan and only heard the \"American exceptionalism version of US history.\"\n\"Over the weekend, my sister went through the Japanese version of @LettersForBL with my Grandfather, and something clicked in him,\" Lin tweeted.\n\"He started seeing racism in America as a systemic human rights issue. On Tuesday, he asked me follow-up questions. We started revising his understanding of American history; more specifically deconstructing the myths that: 1) Racial discrimination ended after slavery 2) The USA is an equal opportunity country,\" Lin wrote.\nA newsletter for Asian aunties and uncles\nKavya Balaji and friends Shilpa Bhat, Shefali Mangtani and Audreela Deb came up with a digital newsletter as a way to talk to the aunties and uncles in their South Asian community about the Black Lives Matter movement.\nThe goal: To educate their community in a way that was easy to understand from the South Asian perspective.\n\"A lot of South Asian immigrant families, like my own, never learned US history or black history in the US because most of them were educated in other countries,\" Balaji said. \"So it makes sense that they didn't already understand all the complexities of this movement.\"\nBalaji says most of the educational resources she's seen on the Black Lives Matter movement are geared toward white people and critical of those who don't understand the movement.\n\"I feel like a lot of non-black people of color see the movement as either a black issue as people who are directly affected by this or a white issue for people who have that history of oppressing black people,\" she said.\nTo fix that problem for her community, Balaji and her friends launched the newsletter on June 1. The document is currently published in English, Hindi and Telegu. Gujarati and Tamil versions are in the works.\nThe letter, titled \"Black Lives Matter: An informational letter to the South Asian community,\" offers a brief history lesson, examining the civil rights movement, rioting and casteism. It also provides resources for making donations.\nBalaji thinks of social justice as a ladder with people who are just starting to learn about it.\n\"In advocacy it's important to understand where other people are at and think about things in an empathetic lens enough to deconstruct why people are thinking the way they are, what contributed to this frame of thought,\" she said. \"Then we can target those things and help them climb up that ladder.\"\nBalaji and her group want to make sure their letter helps the South Asian community become permanent supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement.\nRewriting their narrative on Black Lives Matter\nSimmi Patel is the brains behind Paper Samosa, an outlet that fuses South Asian and Western pop culture with colorful, meme-like posts and merchandise.\nWhile Patel is usually crafting light-hearted content, she told CNN she wanted to figure out what to say, and how to say it, amid the current thirst for understanding.\nIn several Instagram posts, titled \"It's times for our South Asian mom's, dad's, aunties, and uncles to rewrite their narratives,\" Patel creates a dialogue between two characters -- emulating a conversation that many South Asians may find themselves having in their family group texts, place of worship or community gatherings.\n\"I think it was important to shake people up with these statements,\" she said. \"We can't just turn away and say that this isn't our problem.\"\nIt was important to Patel to come at her illustrations from a place of understanding and compassion, coupled with factual statements, she says.\n\"I will not stay 'chup;\" translates in English to, \"I will not stay silent.\"\nSix women established the California-based advocacy group South Asians for Black Lives in 2019. Its goal is to \"amplify black voices and also increase efforts from the South Asian community to be better allies.\"\nThrough social media posts and online resources, South Asians for Black Lives provides the building blocks for beginning conversations about confronting anti-blackness within neighborhoods and communities.\nHaleema Bharoocha, a volunteer with the group, said the organization is working on a curriculum for the fall.\n\"There's been a lot of people jumping from awareness straight to action without doing the work of education or self interrogation and really thinking about how to intentionally engage in sustainable allyship and not just show up for one protest,\" she said.\n'Do this right'\nThe stereotype of Asians being the \"model minority\" has long been used to downplay racism and drive a wedge between Asian and black Americans, says Emily Chi, who recently graduated from the Harvard Kennedy School with a master's in public policy.\n\"Our privilege and our proximity to whiteness and the lies that we believe about our model minority status has always been harming communities of color,\" Chi told CNN. \"(So) we've always had a responsibility to do this right.\"\nChi and Joan Moon, a researcher at Harvard Kennedy School, worked with their colleagues to create the \"Anti-Racism Resources for Asian Americans\" toolkit.

Phelps said he was the one who informed Wallace about its discovery.\nA source with Richard Petty Motorsports told CNN that Wallace never saw the noose.\nFor Black NASCAR fans, the Confederate flag ban is welcome but long overdue\nWallace tweeted Sunday that the \"despicable act\" left him \"incredibly saddened and serves as a painful reminder of how much further we have to go as a society and how persistent we must be in the fight against racism.\"\n\"This will not break me, I will not give in nor will I back down. I will continue to proudly stand for what I believe in,\" Wallace said.\nNASCAR told CNN the garage area where the noose was found is restricted to essential personnel, which includes race teams, NASCAR officials, security and health and safety personnel.\nMonday's race will be the first time NASCAR fans are allowed to return to the track since the coronavirus pandemic.

Some of his fellow seminary students called him a country hick behind his back.\nHe was so earnest that when a seminary professor returned his heavily corrected paper, he didn't get angry. He instead sent the professor a note of thanks, saying no one had ever tried to help him like this before.\n\"Every word from him,\" the professor later said about the young man named John Robert Lewis, \"had its own special truth. They might as well be carved in granite if John spoke them.\"\nThe US loses two icons of the civil rights movement in one day\nThat \"special truth\" is what many tributes to US Rep. John Lewis missed when they marked his death last weekend.\nHis death came on the same day as another civil rights giant, the Rev. C.T. Vivian, and four months after that of Joseph E. Lowery.\nTaken together, they seem to mark an end. Lewis was depicted as one of the last living links to the classic civil rights era of epic marches and rousing speeches.\nAnd with his demise, the obvious questions arose: Who are the Black leaders to champion the civil rights battles of today?\nThe answer: no one. And that's a good thing.\nThe truth is Lewis was no civil rights \"hero,\" and that's precisely what made him special.\nIn many ways, Lewis had more in common with the Black Lives Matter protestors who filled the nation's streets earlier this year than the iconic civil rights leaders he's so often compared to.\nThe era of great speeches is over\nHow John Lewis befriended a young boy and changed his life forever\nConsider the story about Lewis' \"special truth.\"\nThose words come from the pen of Pulitzer-Prize winning author, David Halberstam, who wrote about Lewis' formative years in a classic civil rights book called \"The Children.\"\nIt details Lewis' journey from poverty in rural Alabama to his enrollment at the American Baptist College in Nashville. The city became a launching pad for the student sit-in movement in the early 1960s.\nSome of Lewis' fellow students underestimated him because he wasn't a great speaker.\nThe classic civil rights era was defined by them, and it wasn't just the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. People like Malcolm X, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Stokely Carmichael could also bring an audience to its feet.\nYet a movement doesn't need a great speaker to be successful today. Black Lives Matter is proof of that. So was Lewis.\n50 years after the March on Washington: What's changed for African-Americans\nLewis was in seemingly every big civil rights battle: the sit-ins, the Freedom Rides, and the March on Washington. Can anyone, though, cite a great speech from him?\nHe is known more for what he didn't say in his most famous speech, the one he gave at the 1963 March on Washington. March organizers asked him to cut portions they deemed too inflammatory.\nDiane Nash, another civil rights icon who was a leader in the Nashville sit-in movement, said Lewis was like that from the beginning. He wouldn't say much when student sit-in leaders convened fiery meetings to discuss decisions that could cost them their lives.\n\"His verbal contribution would often be a sentence like, 'I think we need a sit-in tomorrow,' '' she says. \"That's about all he would say.\"\nYet Lewis was considered one of the greatest student sit-in leaders by the sheer power of his example. He kept showing up at the front of protests no matter how many times he was assaulted.\nThe power of that kind of persistence sometimes gets lost when people talk about that era. People overestimate the power of a great speech. They think the movement was powered by Aaron Sorkin-like moments: Impossibly eloquent leaders unfurling brilliant speeches skewering their opponents.\nBut King's \"I Have a Dream Speech\" wouldn't have mattered much if the movement didn't keep up the pressure of demonstrations through campaigns in Mississippi the next year and Alabama the following year. It wouldn't have mattered much if President Lyndon Johnson didn't use all of his legislative cunning to steer the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act.\nPersistence matters more than eloquence\nRemembering John Lewis\nPersistence is more important than eloquence. Lewis proved that. Black Lives Matter and the other protestors are proving that today.\nCan anyone, for example, cite any great speech from any of those protestors this year? But the absence of such a moment didn't slow it down.\nOne of the most defining moments in this year's protests didn't even come through words but came through a piece of street theater. An unidentified woman dubbed the \"Naked Athena\" seized the spotlight this past weekend when she appeared \"like an apparition\" before armed police troops and dared them to hurt her.\nShe never said a word but her surreal appearance and calm amid danger may be one of those signature protest moments.\nTechnology fuels movements now\nJohn Lewis Fast Facts\nThere's another reason that protest movements don't need great speeches to fuel them: technology. Today's protestors don't just want to listen; they want to express themselves as well.\nWe live in an era when people are accustomed to having their own platform, Timothy Patrick McCarthy, an activist and historian at the Harvard Kennedy School Harvard University, told me when I interviewed him for a story about BLM.\n\"Everybody tweets, Snapchats and posts on Facebook,\" he said. \"Everybody has a platform.\"\nA movement is no longer dependent on a charismatic leader\nBlack Lives Matter mural outside Trump Tower vandalized three times in one week\nThe tributes to Lewis also missed something else about the man. They called him a \"civil rights leader.\"\nThat's actually the wrong word to use for Lewis, say some who worked for him.\n\"John didn't see himself as a spokesperson or a leader but as an organizer,\" says Larry Rubin, who worked alongside Lewis in a group called SNCC, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.\n\"To be an effective organizer, you had to set your ego aside because you were building up others.\"\nWhether they know it or not, BLM subscribes to the same leadership model that Lewis followed. It's a \"a\" organization; so are many of the other protests against police brutality that spread across the country.\n\"We've always made it clear that we are one of many,\" Johnetta Elzie, a leader in the BLM movement and Campaign Zero, another organization formed to fight police brutality, once told me. \"There's not one person who can be a leader of the movement. We're all leaders.\"\n'The cross is a little lighter today'\n\nMany critics thought BLM was making a mistake. They thought an organization needed strong central leadership to articulate goals, beat back criticism and provide direction. (I was one of them.)\nElzie was right -- this year's protests prove her point. But Lewis and SNCC members proved that point years ago.\nSNCC didn't provide charismatic leaders. They encouraged people in the community to step out in front, like Fannie Lou Hamer, the Mississippi sharecropper who turned out to be one of the most mesmerizing leaders in the movement.\nThere's a pragmatism in this approach as well. Movements built around charismatic leaders evaporate when that leader is assassinated or discredited. The civil rights movement never recovered from the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968. Few today can name the organization that Malcolm X headed when he was assassinated by Nation of Islam members (It was called the Organization of Afro-American Unity).\nA singular leader may not survive today's media scrutiny\nPolls show widespread support of Black Lives Matters protests and varied views on how to reform police\nThere's another reason why building a movement around a singular leader might not work today: They may not survive today's media environment.\nHow, for example, would conservative media treat King's alleged marital infidelity? How would social media handle Malcolm's criminal past as \"Detroit Red.\" Public figures don't have private lives anymore. There are so many ways that a leader can be discredited.\nLewis, to his credit, never went through that social media crucible. He preserved almost universal respect until the very end. He also lived long enough to see the election of the nation's first Black president as well as the Floyd protests spreading across the world this year.\nHe talked about the protests often before he passed.\n\"This feels and looks so different,\" he said in an interview with CBS not long before he died. \"It is so much more massive and all inclusive.\"\nStill, the people who flooded the streets this year aren't that much different than the young Lewis who people made fun of in seminary.\nThey spoke with actions, not words. They kept coming back the next day, no matter how much they were hurt. And they defied all the expectations for what a civil rights leader was supposed to talk and act like.\nIt's true that Lewis belongs to the era of Freedom Rides and epic marches, but he also showed you don't need to be a traditional civil rights hero to get things done.\nWe do him a disservice if we freeze him in the black and white footage of the 1960s.\nHe doesn't just belong on the Edmund Pettus Bridge. He's in the streets of places like Portland, where protestors keep marching through tear gas and rubber bullets.\nHe lives today as much as he has in the past."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/04/us/fourth-july-america-blake/index.html", "headline": "Our country is in chaos. But it's a great time to be an American", "published_date": "2020-07-04", "text": "(CNN)On July 9, 1776, a rowdy group of American colonists banded together at a political rally in New York City and did something that today would be called \"badass.\"\nThey had just been treated to a public reading of the Declaration of Independence, which Congress had officially adopted less than a week earlier. After hearing calls to \"dissolve the political bands\" of tyranny, they marched to a public park that featured a statue of King George III, Britain's ruler, and knocked the 4,000-pound statue off its 15-foot pedestal.\nThe head of the statue was then decapitated and perched on top of a spike, and much of the rest was melted down to make 42,000 musket balls for American soldiers.\nThe historian Erika Doss thought of that scene recently while watching protesters toppling statues of Confederate heroes. Doss, who recounts the 1776 episode in her book, \"Memorial Mania,\" sees a parallel between the colonists who fought against Great Britain and protesters who rail against Confederate monuments today.\nA man holds a Black Lives Matter sign during a protest against racial inequality on June 23, 2020, in Boston.\n\"They're patriots,\" says Doss, an American studies professor at the University of Notre Dame, of today's protesters. \"They're looking at the symbols and these visual and martial emblems and icons in their midst and they're saying this doesn't stand for who we are today.\"\nIt's easy to be cynical this Fourth of July weekend as the US celebrates its birth. The country seems like a mess. Racial protests have rocked every major city. Unemployment has soared. And Americans can't even agree if they should wear face masks in the middle of a pandemic.\nBut what some see as chaos, others see as an explosion of patriotism. They see it in the armies of Americans that took to the streets to protest racism. They see it in the companies that are taking unprecedented stands against racial and social injustice.\nEven the Americans who are wearing masks for the health of their neighbors -- they, too, are reasons to wave the flag.\nA group of Bostonians dressed as Native Americans dump crates of imported British tea into Boston Harbor as a protest against the British Tea Act in 1773.\nAll of these different groups have declared their independence from symbols and ideas that they've decided no longer represent them, Doss and others say.\nThey are doing what their ancestors did in 1776, Doss says: \"They are reimagining themselves and the nation.\"\nAmerica is bending toward justice\nThe evidence of this reimagining is reflected in the headlines.\nSomething has shifted in America when the Mississippi state flag, which bears the cross of the Confederate battle flag, is taken down while the popularity of the Black Lives Matter movement soars to an all-time high. Recent polls suggest that this year's BLM protests, which drew as many as 26 million people, were the largest movement in US history.\nRead more from John Blake:\nAm I racist?

When they said, \"all men are created equal,\" that didn't include Black people, who were not considered fully human. They didn't consider women equal, either.\nBut Black people extracted concepts from the Declaration of Independence, like the right to protest, and \"turned them into tools for American citizenship,\" Price says. \"They took the words of the founders and rammed them up their damn throats.\"\nWe've expanded the definition of an American hero\nIt's easy to forget, but the person who became the catalyst the American Revolution was not a White man. He was half Black and half Native American. His name was Crispus Attucks, and he was killed during the 1770 Boston Massacre, an event that sparked the Revolutionary War.\nThe person who sparked the unprecedented wave of racial protests this year was also a Black man. George Floyd, who died while being arrested in May by Minneapolis police, is in some ways a modern-day Attucks, says Jerald Podair, a historian at Lawrence University in Wisconsin.\n\"Attucks died not knowing what his impact and significance would be, as did George Floyd,\" says Podair.\nHistory textbooks tell us that American heroes are almost always White men carrying guns. A reader has to dig to learn about people like Sacagawea, the Native American woman whose language skills and bravery saved the vaunted Lewis & Clark expedition of the early 19th century.\nAn image based on an iconic painting, \"Spirit of '76,\" that depicts American patriots of the colonial era.\nThis year's protests, though, have enlarged the definition of a what an American hero looks like. Some of the leaders and participants in Black Lives Matter protests are LGBTQ. The movement is multiracial and multiethnic.\nAnd in some ways these protesters are just as tough as their colonial forebears.\nThe history books love to tell stories of the Minutemen, the elite band of Revolutionary War soldiers who were ready at a minute's notice to rush into battle. The Black Lives Matter protesters and others who recently took to the streets to demonstrate were not that different. They risked their lives, often on short notice via a text or social media alert, to demonstrate against racism in the middle of a pandemic.\nAge made no difference. Many of those demonstrators were young -- some even too young to vote. They took rubber bullets to the face and swallowed tear gas. And then they came back the next day, like soldiers.\nIf you think that characterization is hyperbolic, listen to the words of another American hero who praised millennials -- people born between 1981 and 1996 -- in a recent speech. He said the country's youth make him optimistic about the future.\n\"They're not a lot like my generation -- in many ways, they are better,\" he said. \"They care so much about their friends, they care about the issues, they question things in a way that I'm not sure we baby boomers questioned.

William McRaven, the Navy SEAL who oversaw the Osama bin Laden raid.\nA man waves an American flag with the words \"Not Free\" on it at a Juneteenth rally in Washington on June 19, 2020.\nThe coronavirus pandemic has also enlarged the definition of an American hero. We've learned that courage isn't just manifested in a SEAL team raid. It also can be summoned in mundane places like a health clinic, a grocery store or a meatpacking plant.\nThe pandemic has led many Americans to realize how dependent they are on these service workers, who risk their lives to keep the country running.\nThe colonists often invoked the term \"liberty\" to celebrate a form of rugged individualism where government and rules left them alone so they could live their version of freedom. So do many modern-day Americans. But democracy also depends on a sense of shared community, says Podair, the Lawrence University historian.\n\"Our life and health depends on the behavior of other people,\" he says. \"We depend on our neighbor, sometimes to get us food or just to remain healthy -- and they on us. Because of the pandemic, America is a more democratic nation today than it was in February.\"\nOur country is finally facing one of its original sins\nThe Black Lives Matter protesters may exceed the Founding Fathers in another way -- they're forcing the nation to face its racism.\nWhen Thomas Jefferson drafted the Declaration of Independence, he added language that described the slave trade as a perverse plot by an evil English king to contaminate the colonies, Joseph J. Ellis recounts in \"Founding Brothers,\" his Pulitzer Prize-winning book.\nThat passage, though was deleted by the Continental Congress in the final draft. The issue was so contentious and ingrained in colonial society that many founders thought abolishing slavery would kill the young nation in its infancy, Ellis wrote.\nBut a new generation of Americans are determined to do what the Founding Fathers refused to do.\nThe Rev. William Barber, president of Repairers of the Breach, speaks in Washington on June 12, 2019.\nAmericans are devouring books on racism and corporate America is taking a stand against racial injustice. Ordinary people are talking about racism with a new depth that's remarkable, says Doss, the historian.\n\"It has been so interesting to see how words like white supremacy and imperialism are part of daily American vocabulary in ways now that were not a couple of years ago,\" she says.\nThis change didn't just happen. It took years of planning and activism.\n\"A multiracial fusion coalition has shifted public opinion in this country, and we've seen a tipping point in the past month,\" says the Rev. William Barber II, a 2018 MacArthur Foundation \"genius\" grant winner and president of Repairers of the Breach, a nonpartisan group that seeks to build a moral agenda around issues of poverty and racism.\n\"Many of us have been building this coalition for years, taking up the work of those who came before us,\" he says. \"We never knew when the tipping point would come, but we are now in a moment where there is a public consensus that America must address the legacy of her original sin in systemic racism.\"\nAt the same time, there appears to be flagging interest in white grievance. It's not just Confederate monuments that are coming down. A core political tactic that relied on coded racist appeals may also be starting to topple.\nA statue of Confederate Commander Richard W. Dowling is removed in Houston, Texas, on June 17, 2020.\nIn the 1960s the Republican Party quietly began its \"Southern Strategy\" of using terms like \"forced busing\" and \"state's rights\" to play on racial fears and win elections. Democrats have also used such appeals, but not to the extent Republicans have.\nBut racial dog whistles just don't hunt like they used to. President Trump is offering proof. He's opposing any effort by the US military to rename bases that bear the name of Confederate commanders. He also called Black Lives Matter a \"symbol of hate.\"\nAnd as of now he's losing badly to Democratic challenger Joe Biden in the polls.\n\"When we look back, we may well realize that there was indeed one last presidential election that could be won on white racial resentment \u2014 but that election happened in 2016,\" Paul Waldman said in a recent Washington Post column.\nWillie Townsend, an employee of the Mississippi State Capitol, on June 30, 2020, hours before Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves signed a bill into law replacing the current state flag.\nProtesters in 2020, though, want more than an end to racist speech. Barber, for example, has helped launch a Poor People's Campaign and his group plans an array of activities around the Fourth of July this weekend.\n\"We can't get sidelined into little reforms around the edges,\" Barber says. \"This isn't just about bringing down a flag or banning chokeholds. We are in a moment that demands a Third Reconstruction to guarantee freedom and equal justice. We must push to become the America that has never yet been.\"\nThat kind of America may seem far off right now. But we no longer have to look to the Founding Fathers to celebrate the spirit that makes this nation special.\nWe can look to the faces of the millions of Americans who took to the streets this year to reimagine the nation. We can look to the nurse who takes our temperature, or the other essential and brave workers who drive buses, deliver groceries and restock store shelves.\nThat's the paradox of this Fourth of July. It is an awful time to be an American. It is a great time to look forward to a New America.\nAll the people who took to the streets this spring are living monuments to a New America -- a land that never was, \"and yet must be.\""}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/12/us/five-things-june-12-trnd/index.html", "headline": "5 things to know for June 12: Protests, election, economy, coronavirus, Lebanon", "published_date": "2020-06-12", "text": "Get '5 Things' in your inbox\nIf your day doesn't start until you're up to speed on the latest headlines, then let us introduce you to your new favorite morning fix.

The review is considered standard, and this one will look at the training, organizing and deployment of roughly 74,000 National Guard members. Also, Gen. Mark Milley, the Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, apologized for appearing with President Trump last week in combat uniform after the forceful clearing of peaceful protesters outside the White House. He said his being there \"created a perception of the military involved in domestic politics.\" Meanwhile, the protests continue to spur palpable change: The Louisville metro council unanimously passed an ordinance called \"Breonna's Law\" that bans no-knock search warrants following the shooting death of Breonna Taylor, a black EMT. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky introduced a similar bill to ban no-knock warrants for federal officers.\nGen. Milley on Trump photo-op: I should not have been there 02:40\n2. Election 2020\nPresident Trump will accept the Republican nomination in Jacksonville, Florida, in August instead of in Charlotte, North Carolina, as originally planned. Trump had grown intent on moving the Republican National Convention over disputes with North Carolina's governor over how to handle it during the pandemic. So now, GOP delegates will elect their nominee from Charlotte, and Trump will make his acceptance speech three states away. The President is expected to hit the campaign trail long before that, though, with his first stop in Tulsa, Oklahoma -- the site of one of the worst acts of racist violence the country has ever seen -- next Friday. That's Juneteenth, a day that commemorates the end of slavery in the US. Political insiders think the President may use the Tulsa event to deliver a long-awaited speech on race amid the ongoing unrest.\nTrump's upcoming Tulsa rally on Juneteenth sparks concern 02:42\n3. Economy\nNew coronavirus fears are putting a swift end to Wall Street's recent rally. US stocks plummeted yesterday, recording their worst day since March 16. Those fears spread to Asian markets, which fell early today. This could signal that investors are concerned about a second pandemic wave, especially since the US recently hit 2 million Covid-19 cases. American joblessness also continues to climb, with 1.5 million more Americans filing for first-time unemployment last week. However, no matter how bad the pandemic gets again, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the US economy will not be shut down again.\nStocks plunge as new coronavirus cases rise 01:22\n4. Coronavirus\nThere's some good news on the coronavirus front, though. Experts say an existing polio vaccine could help protect against the disease. There is plenty of evidence that existing inoculations like polio vaccines protect children against a wide range of infections, and researchers recently wrote in Science magazine that it's worth trying them out against the coronavirus. An oral polio vaccine is safe, cheap, easy to give and widely available, with over 1 billion doses produced and used annually in more than 140 countries. Meanwhile, the first trial of a Covid-19 antibody cocktail in the United States is underway. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. says if its drug combination is successful, it could treat and prevent Covid-19 -- and hopefully be available by the fall.\nHow antibodies protect us from viruses 01:37\n5. Lebanon\nAnti-government protesters have flooded the streets of Lebanese cities as the country's currency tanked, adding to a string of economic woes. Lebanon's currency has lost around 70% of its value since October, with a big dip in the last few days. The currency's collapse has stirred panic in a nation that relies heavily on imports for its basic needs. On top of it all, Lebanon has endured soaring food prices, mass layoffs and business closures in recent months. The government, led by Prime Minister Hassan Diab, has been in power for just over 100 days, and protesters say it hasn't done enough to address the economic problems or curb government corruption.\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\nCollege coaches and teams want to encourage voting by giving athletes Election Day off\nThe coach behind the movement says voting is a habit that should be started at a young age.\nKelly Clarkson and her husband Brandon Blackstock are splitting\nThe couple have been married for seven years.\nThese are some of the world's most expensive divorces 01:52\nA 50,000-year-old lake in India just turned pink, and no one knows why\nSeems extremely normal during these troubling times, nothing to see here.\nSony finally revealed its PS5, and here's everything you need to know\nStaying inside suddenly got a little easier.\nSony unveils the PlayStation 5 01:57\nTamagotchi, the virtual pet from the '90s, is back in the US\nCan't wait to be fettered by an unreasonable sense of responsibility to an unfeeling collection of pixels again!\nTODAY'S NUMBER\n170,000\nThat's approximately how many accounts Twitter recently removed that it said were tied to the Chinese government.

He used to write magazine articles and ran a YouTube channel dedicated to the sport. He loves the energy at the races, the camaraderie of the campgrounds and the sound of cars roaring by. Everyone, he said, should go to a race at least once.\nNASCAR bans Confederate flags at all races, events\nIn recent years, however, he pulled away from NASCAR because he felt it had inadequately addressed social issues like police brutality and racial injustice.\n\"It didn't feel like I belonged there anymore,\" Wiley said, \"or at least that my voice wasn't heard there anymore.\"\nThat changed this week when NASCAR announced it would ban the Confederate flag from races, just days after the only full-time African American driver in NASCAR's Cup Series, Bubba Wallace, donned a shirt emblazoned \"I can't breathe\" and unveiled a Black Lives Matter paint scheme in the wake of protests sparked by the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.\n\"That was huge,\" Wiley said.\nFor African American NASCAR fans who spoke to CNN, the Confederate flag ban and Wallace's decision to be more outspoken about race are welcome but overdue changes in a sport they felt had failed to be inclusive in the past. For them, being a black fan has meant years of feeling overlooked, of ignoring hurtful remarks by their favorite drivers, and steering clear of fans and campsites who they feared would be unwelcoming.\nBut now, they're hoping to see more people who look like them at the racetrack.\n\"I'm really excited about the direction the sport's headed in, and I haven't been able to say that for a couple years now,\" Wiley said.\nBubba Wallace, the only full-time African American driver in NASCAR's Cup Series, wears a T-shirt that says \"I Can't Breathe\" and \"Black Lives Matter\" during the National Anthem before the NASCAR Cup Series Folds of Honor QuikTrip 500 at Atlanta Motor Speedway on June 7, 2020.\n'It meant the world'\nNASCAR announced the Confederate flag ban Wednesday, writing in a statement that the flag's presence at NASCAR events \"runs contrary to our commitment to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all fans, our competitors and our industry.\"\n\"Bringing people together around a love for racing and the community that it creates is what makes our fans and sport special,\" the statement said.\nMany in and outside NASCAR's fan base praised the stock car racing league. Among those supporters was Mark Mosley, who told CNN his kids joke that he's the only black man on the south side of Chicago who likes NASCAR.\nMosley admitted he's struggled with his love of the sport. Over the years, Mosley said he's probably taken 10 friends to Chicagoland Speedway, hoping to convince them they could like NASCAR, too.\n\"None of them wanted to return because of the environment,\" he said. \"Half of them left halfway through the race.\"\nStatue removals show change is coming \u2014 even in the capital of the Confederacy\nWhen former driver Richard Petty \u2014 Mosley's \"idol\" growing up \u2014 came out against kneeling during the National Anthem, Mosley said it was like a dagger to the heart. He decided to stop watching altogether after driver Kyle Larson used the n-word in a virtual racing event in April. \"I gave up on NASCAR, to be honest.\"\nBut he changed his mind this week.\n\"I was elated, excited, happy, any positive adjective or adverb you can think of,\" he said of the flag ban. \"It meant the world to me as an African American NASCAR fan.\"\nAnother fan, Alex Burns, said he felt alienated from the rest of the fan base at times.\nWalking around a track or in the campgrounds, Burns said he kept his \"head on the swivel,\" avoiding campsites where people were drinking and flying the Confederate flag.\nWhile that feeling never deterred Burns from enjoying the sport, he said he's \"very proud of NASCAR\" for banning the flag.\n\"I'm even more of a fan of NASCAR,\" he said, adding later, \"I just hope people understand that, you know, it's time for change.\"\n'There aren't a lot of people who look like me'\nBrehanna Daniels \u2014 the first black woman to pit in a NASCAR national series race \u2014 also supports the flag ban.\n\"I'm very proud of NASCAR right now,\" Daniels told CNN in an interview. \"We're moving on up the ladder. We're taking baby steps but we're changing things for the better.\"\nDaniels was nervous when she first became a NASCAR tire changer through the Drive for Diversity program, which aims to bring more minorities and women into the NASCAR fold.\n\"There aren't a lot of people who look like me,\" Daniels said. \"It's a beautiful thing when you see multiple faces \u2014 like in the NBA and the NFL there's people of different races, ethnicities. I like seeing diversity, and in NASCAR you really don't see much of that.\"\nBrehanna Daniels, tire changer on the #52 Winn Dixie Chevrolet, watches from pit road at the 61st Daytona 500 in Daytona Beach, Florida, on February 17, 2019.\nSo for Daniels, the steps taken this week are \"meaningful changes.\"\n\"It honestly meant a lot,\" she told CNN, wiping away tears. \"Because it's hard being black, y'all.\" She pointed to the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, saying \"nobody deserves to die like that.\"\n\"I applaud NASCAR for finally realizing that things need to change for the better,\" she said. \"I will always be behind them because of that.\"\nFlag represents division, not history, fans say\nNot everyone agreed the flag ban was the right decision.\n\"You're getting both sides, a lot of positive outreach and gaining new fans as we go,\" Bubba Wallace told CNN's Don Lemon. \"Then you got your fans who will never watch NASCAR again, the same fans who will never watch the NFL after the kneeling, the same fans that were crying out that we're ruining their lives and just throwing a pity party.\"\nNASCAR truck racer Ray Ciccarelli says he's quitting over the company's decision to ban the Confederate flag\nOne high-profile detractor was Ray Ciccarelli, a part-time driver in the NASCAR Gander RV & Outdoors Truck Series, who announced he would quit at the end of this season, writing in a statement, \"I don't believe in kneeling during Anthem nor taken ppl right to fly what ever flag they love.\"\n\"I could care less about the Confederate Flag,\" he added, \"but there are ppl that do and it doesn't make them a racist.\"\nOther fans spoke out on social media, insisting the flag was about history or Southern \"heritage,\" not a symbol of racism.\nAndria Renee Phillips, an African American fan since the early 2000s, said it didn't really bother her when she saw the flag at NASCAR events, agreeing it was \"a part of history\" \u2014 though she said it was \"painful, no matter how you look at it.\"\n\"I feel like the flag is a reminder of what was,\" she said, \"but then there's different perspectives on the flag ... It has memories for people. Good, bad, whatever it may be.\"\nConfederate flags flying over the infield campground before start of the NASCAR Southern 500 at Darlington Raceway on September 6, 2015, in Darlington, South Carolina.\nBut to Daniels, the Confederate flag represents \"division.\"\n\"And that's not what we want,\" she said. \"We're more about togetherness and not being divided. I'm behind NASCAR all the way, but I felt that was dividing us.\"\nBurns told CNN that while the flag may be part of history, it represents \"a bad time in history where we as black people were enslaved.\"\n\"In terms of history, \" Mosley said, \"history has proven that blacks have always been mistreated. So historically speaking, to me, (the Confederate flag) represents hate.\"\n'We're being listened to'\nA big part of the NASCAR experience is hanging out at campsites within the track's infield leading up to a race, Wiley said. But whenever he saw the Confederate flag flying at a campsite, \"it was an indication to me of like, I don't know what these people are about.\"\nBubba Wallace says there's more good than bad in fan reaction to NASCAR's Confederate flag ban\n\"You want to be part of this whole big family atmosphere,\" he said. \"But at the same time it's like, I don't know if I'm welcome here.\"\nOver the years, as he became more aware of social issues like police brutality, Wiley felt NASCAR failed to reach out to black fans. Even as the Black Lives Matter movement grew, Wiley said, \"NASCAR was still very much on the side of, 'Blue Lives Matter, we support our law enforcement, we support the military,' everything else.\"\n\"I didn't mind them saying we support law enforcement,\" he said. \"But at the same time, to completely ignore the other side of the argument was kind of insulting to me.\"\nIn 2015, after nine black churchgoers were massacred at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, NASCAR issued a statement saying it would continue \"to disallow use of the Confederate Flag symbol in any officials NASCAR capacity.\" But it stopped short of an outright ban, and Wiley wondered if it would ever happen.\nBut he felt NASCAR had no choice. In recent years, NASCAR has dealt with a narrative of declining viewership and attendance. Without efforts to be more inclusive, Wiley felt \"they're not going to make it.\"\n\"There aren't enough people who still believe in this to sustain it.\"\nBubba Wallace with his Black Lives Matter car before the start of a NASCAR Cup Series race in Martinsville, Virginia, on June 10, 2020.\nThat's why black NASCAR fans are excited. They hope this change will help attract more black and brown fans to the sport.\nFor Wiley, the ban and Wallace's Black Lives Matter paint scheme were \"one of the most uplifting things\" for a fan who's felt disconnected from NASCAR for a long time.\n\"We're accepted and we're being listened to \u2014 in this space,\" he said. \"Finally.\"\n\"NASCAR needs more diversity,\" Daniels said. \"And with the recent things that have happened, a lot of minorities are saying, 'Hey, when's the next race? I'm trying to come.'\"\n\"With more of that,\" she said, \"NASCAR will have a bigger audience, a bigger crowd.\"\nOne day, Daniels hopes she'll look up from the pit road and see a sea of diverse faces looking back at her.\n\"That would be a sight to see, wouldn't it?\"\nCNN's Steve Almasy, Katherine Jennings, Allen Kim, Keith O'Shea and Amir Vera contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/18/us/black-women-overlooked-social-justice-movements-trnd/index.html", "headline": "Black women are often overlooked by social justice movements, a new study finds", "published_date": "2020-07-18", "text": "(CNN)Black women across the United States have been marching on the front lines of protests for decades, demanding justice and equality -- but they are still disregarded by social justice movements, according to a new study.\n\"Black women are often overlooked in people's conversations about racism and sexism even though they face a unique combination of both of these forms of discrimination simultaneously,\" said Stewart Coles, lead researcher of the study published by the American Psychological Association.\n\"This 'intersectional invisibility' means that movements that are supposed to help Black women may be contributing to their marginalization.\"\nThe study's findings are based on data from 1,000 participants in the US who were asked whether 41 positive or negative stereotypical attributes -- such as aggression, violence, ambitiousness, or sexual promiscuity -- were associated with different races or groups.\n'Am I racist?'

As a result, a one-size-fits-all approach to anti-Black racism leaves Black women's concerns overlooked.\"\nAlexis Bass, a 22-year-old Black activist and artist who organizes with the Black Lives Matter movement in Georgia, agrees with the study's findings.\nPhotos: A racial reckoning in America\nShe says Black community issues often overshadow Black women's issues, which can be unique and complex. Diverse movements think of Black men and women as facing the same struggle. Meanwhile, the black community may prioritize issues of race over gender or sexuality. This leaves Black women feeling excluded from women's movements and marginalized in their own community.\n\"Injustice against Black women affects the entire community, but sometimes we're at the bottom of the totem pole,\" Bass said.\nAs evidence, Bass pointed to nationwide protests over the death of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man killed by a Minneapolis police officer in late May. Bass noted that Breonna Taylor, an unarmed Black woman killed by police in Louisville, Kentucky, in March didn't garner nearly as much attention.\n\"All of these cases affect my community as a whole, but when it comes to Black women sharing experiences and injustices, our word and our lives suddenly don't matter.\"\nThe exclusion of Black women puts them at risk for greater harm, the study said.\n\"Intersectional invisibility suggests that Black women may be harmed when their unique experiences of both racism and sexism go unappreciated by larger movements.\""}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/10/us/desean-jackson-anti-semitic-posts-mitchell-schwartz-spt-trnd/index.html", "headline": "Jewish NFL player Mitchell Schwartz says DeSean Jackson's anti-Semitic posts came from 'a place of ignorance'", "published_date": "2020-07-10", "text": "(CNN)Kansas City Chief's player Mitchell Schwartz spoke out on Thursday about DeSean Jackson's anti-Semitic social media posts, calling on the Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver to be more careful about how he uses his platform.\n\"I truly don't think DeSean meant any sort of hate or anything,\" Schwartz said. \"I think it came way more from a place of ignorance.\"\nJackson posted a series of anti-Semitic posts on Instagram over the weekend, one of which included a quote about Jews falsely attributed to Adolf Hitler.

It cited CAHOOTS, a community policing partnership that has been in place in Eugene, Oregon, as an example of a program to examine.\n\"The bottom line is that the way things have been going is not working for our communities,\" Wesson, who authored the motion with Council President Nury Martinez, wrote on Twitter.\n\"This last month has made that crystal clear. We have a responsibility to listen to our people, and our people have spoken. I look forward to continuing this work alongside @BLMLA,\" Wesson wrote, referring to Black Lives Matter-LA.\nThe vote comes after activists in Los Angeles -- led by the city's Black Lives Matter chapter -- for weeks repeated the same call to action voiced by many nationwide following the May death of George Floyd: Defund the police.\nThe move to replace some police with trained crisis responders is one component of the movement. Supporters of defunding police -- either abolishing police entirely or shrinking their departments' budgets and reinvesting those funds in education or housing -- believe that unarmed workers trained to deescalate violence could better serve some community members.\nWeeks of activism\nFloyd, a 46-year-old Black man, died in late May after pleading for help as a Minneapolis police officer used his knee on Floyd's neck to pin him to the ground for more than eight minutes.\nVideo of the incident surfaced and quickly sparked a global movement to demand justice and end police brutality in solidarity with Black Lives Matter, with protests nationwide including in LA.\nOn June 15, activists presented a nine-page report called the People's Budget LA -- accompanied by a slideshow and two-hour presentation -- in person to city officials.\n\"We are saying defund the police,\" Melina Abdullah, co-founder of Black Lives Matter-LA, said in the presentation. \"We're also saying reimagine public safety.\"\nOne day later, Wesson echoed Abdullah's words in his own statement announcing he would introduce a motion to replace LAPD officers \"with unarmed, non-law enforcement agencies who will be responsible for responding to non-violent calls for service.\"\n\"We need to reimagine public safety in the 21st century,\" Wesson said on June 16. \"One which reduces the need for armed police presence, especially when the situation does not necessarily require it.\"\nWesson, who was the first Black president of the Los Angeles City Council, said police have gone from part of the solution to part of the problem and \"may not be best equipped\" to respond to non-emergency situations.\nThe Los Angeles Police Protective League, a union that represents nearly 10,000 sworn personnel, told CNN when the motion was proposed that the move to replace some officers could improve outcomes between police and the communities they serve.\n\"We agree with Councilmember Wesson that not every call our city leaders have asked us to respond to should be a police response,\" Tom Saggau, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Protective League (LAPPL), told CNN in a statement on June 16.\n\"We are more than willing to talk about how, or if, we respond to non-criminal and non-emergency calls so we can free up time to respond quickly to 911 calls, crack down on violent and property crime, and expand our community policing efforts.\"\nTuesday, Mayor Eric Garcetti -- who has been criticized by LA activists amid the movement to defund police -- praised the city council's plan.\n\"We must act to reform public safety in our communities -- and today, we took an important step forward,\" he tweeted.\nNationwide calls to 'defund the police'\nOver the past few months, \"defund the police\" has become a rallying cry among activists across the US.\nThe movement calls for investing a sizable chunk of a city's budget -- normally designated for funding police departments -- to communities, especially marginalized ones where much of the policing occurs.\nThe concept's been a murmur for years, particularly following the protests against police brutality in Ferguson, Missouri, though it seemed improbable in 2014.\nNow, local officials have begun listening to activist demands -- and change, at least in some areas of the country, seems more probable.\n\"The world is speaking right now,\" Abdullah said while addressing City Council members in mid-June. \"They're saying we don't want a system of policing that puts targets on the backs of Black people especially, but also is a regular assailant and traumatizer of our entire community.\"\nLast week, members of the city council in Minneapolis -- where Floyd was killed -- moved to dismantle its police force and replace it with a department of community safety and violence prevention.\n\"This is one action of many that we need to take on the road to a more equitable and just

LGBTQ rights\nThe Supreme Court delivered a huge win for LGBTQ rights by ruling that federal civil rights law protects gay, lesbian and transgender workers. The opinion, written by Justice Neil Gorsuch, argues, \"An employer who fires an individual for being homosexual or transgender fires that person for traits or actions it would not have questioned in members of a different sex. Sex plays a necessary and undisguisable role in the decision, exactly what Title VII forbids.\" The landmark 6-3 ruling yesterday will extend protections to millions of workers. It's also a clear rebuke of the White House's recent attempts to cut into LGBTQ protections. The White House has argued that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which bars discrimination based on sex, does not cover gender identity and sexual orientation. The administration last week announced it was scrapping regulations that bar discrimination in health care against patients who are transgender.\nToobin: This is fascinating and enormously important 01:36\n2. North Korea\nNorth Korea has blown up -- as in, completely destroyed -- an office used for talks between itself and South Korea. If ever there were a sign that the relationship between the adversaries is deteriorating, this is it. The building has been closed for months due to the coronavirus, but it was obviously a symbol of goodwill between the nations. North Korea says it decided to raze the office as yet another retaliatory measure against South Korea after defectors used balloons to send anti-North Korean leaflets north of the DMZ. The country recently announced it is cutting all ties with South Korea over the incident and will remilitarize parts of the Korean border that have been dormant for years. It's illegal -- and extremely risky -- for average North Koreans to consume literature or entertainment that's not approved by the government. Experts also suspect North Korea's recent actions may be its attempt to gin up a crisis.\nNorth Korea blows up liaison office with South Korea 03:28\n3. Protests\nSeveral disturbing incidents have marred recent Black Lives Matter demonstrations. A man was shot and wounded last night during a protest in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and police suspect vigilante groups may be to blame. In Portland, Oregon, police closed parts of downtown and declared a civil disturbance after a police officer was hit in the head with a large rock. In New York City, three police officers were briefly hospitalized after drinking shakes from Shake Shack that may have been tainted with bleach; the NYPD found \"no criminality\" by restaurant employees. And in Florida, a 19-year-old Black Lives Matter activist named Oluwatoyin \"Toyin\" Salau was found dead a week after she went missing. On the last day anyone saw her, she had tweeted about being sexually assaulted. Police have arrested a suspect.\nSWAT team resigns after police chief kneels with protesters 02:58\n4. Police reform\nPresident Trump is expected to sign an executive order on police reform today. The order will establish a national certification system for law enforcement agencies and a database to better track excessive use of force by officers nationwide, plus encourage departments to shore up mental health resources for responses related to mental health, homelessness and addiction. It's a modest step and leaves the door open for more significant action from Congress. To that end, Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill are working to advance two competing bills. The Democratic measure is more stringent and proposes banning no-knock warrants and chokeholds. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has likened chokeholds to lynching and says she thinks her Republican counterparts will agree to such a ban.\nPelosi: Chokehold is a lynching.

That's the staggering new prediction from a closely watched model put out by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. At this point, experts agree a second wave is all but inevitable as more areas open up. Not to mention, cases are continuing to rise in at least 18 states. Meanwhile, the FDA has revoked its emergency use authorization for the drugs hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to treat Covid-19. Hydroxychloroquine is the drug touted by President Trump, who claims to have taken it himself. The FDA says the drugs don't meet the criteria for emergency use, and the latest scientific evidence shows they may not be effective against the disease.\nBeijing reintroduces strict lockdown following new outbreak 02:08\nTHIS JUST IN\nDeadly clash along the China-India border\nThree Indian soldiers have been killed during a \"violent face-off\" with Chinese troops along the countries' de facto border in the Himalayas, the Indian army said.

So we knew where we were going, who was going, and what time.\nCharles Black, member of the Atlanta Student Movement\nOne Freedom Rider described how nonviolent civil rights protesters underwent training on how to respond when they were verbally abused or physically assaulted.\nThere were simulated beatings and acts of violence they had to go through in the training, with questions about ... how they would react and how to protect themselves while the brutality was being inflicted. That's one of the big differences and something I have not heard of being done with today's protests.\nKredelle Petway, one of the Freedom Riders\nThe violence did not come from the protestors back in the '60s. The violence then came from perpetrators, from law enforcement and hate groups.\nKredelle Petway, one of the Freedom Riders\nHow they spread their message\nTHEN: Rallies, speeches, opinion pieces, interviews with the news media, nonviolent protests that deliberately courted violence\nNOW: Social media and phone cameras give protesters a new tool that's used to organize, to spread messaging and to hold wrongdoers accountable\nNobody had a camera back in our time. The only things that were shown were if the newsmen were around, like in Birmingham and all that stuff with dogs and water hoses. Everybody's got a camera (now), so more of those instances are being captured and shown on the news.\nCharles Black, member of the Atlanta Student Movement\nOne Freedom Rider described how the open-casket funeral of Emmett Till, a 14-year-old lynched by whites in 1955 in Mississippi, shocked the nation when news photos of his battered face appeared in newspapers across the country:\nEmmett Till's mother put America on the world stage and that (news photography) was the technology at that time. Now technology is much faster, much more available and you can move it across the world in a matter of seconds.\nAlphonso Petway, one of the Freedom Riders\nThe young lady that recorded the situation (last month) on her phone -- had she not been there, George Floyd would have just been another number. Because whatever the police say, it goes.\nMiller Green, one of the Freedom Riders\nTheir slogans\nTHEN: \"We shall overcome,\" \"I am a man,\" \"Freedom now,\" \"Black power\"\nNOW: #BlackLivesMatter, \"I can't breathe,\" \"Say his name ...\" \"Hands up don't shoot\"\nOne civil rights protester described how some white people in the 1950s and 1960s had their own weaponized language:\nIn our time, any white person, even a young child, could regard a black adult as a boy. And you were expected to address them preferentially and with respect. And they were called Mister, and in some cases when blacks were still working in the households even the young white boy would be called Master, or some such thing, and adult white males would call older black men 'boy.' So it's making the point of that, you know, I'm a man. I'm not a boy.\nCharles Black, member of the Atlanta Student Movement\nThe response\nTHEN: Assassinations, bombings, police dogs, fire hoses, officers with clubs, discriminatory code words such as \"agitators,\" \"outsiders\"\nNOW: Riot gear, tear gas, flash bangs, discriminatory code words such as \"thugs\"\nThe public spokespersons in political and business positions ... will always try to couch their bigotry in some kind of polite term or something that sounds really good. You know, 'law and order.' Who could oppose law and order? But what that really meant was oppression.\nCharles Black, member of the Atlanta Student Movement\nA member of the Little Rock Nine described her reaction to President Trump saying that protesters who breached the White House fence would be met by \"vicious dogs\":\n'Come on over the fence and we'll use dogs.' Really? I heard that when I was eight. I heard that when I was seven. I heard that when I was six.\nDr. Melba Pattillo Beals, one of the Little Rock Nine\nIn Birmingham, when they turned dogs and water hoses on us, it was just as barbaric then as it is now.

George Floyd\nColonial slave trader statue torn down amid global protests 02:00\nFormer Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin will appear in court today exactly two weeks after George Floyd's death. Chauvin was the officer filmed on video with his knee on Floyd's neck before he died. He's been charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Also today, a third and final memorial service will be held for Floyd in Houston, where he grew up. These key developments come after a second weekend of protests that have gone global, and grown to encompass more issues of systemic racism and police brutality. In the UK, protesters toppled a statue of 17th-century slave trader Edward Colston, echoing several instances in the US where Confederate monuments have been defaced, removed or designated for removal. In Brazil, protesters gathered in support of Black Lives Matter, and to protest President Jair Bolsonaro's government, including its handling of the coronavirus pandemic.\n2. Police reform\nMinneapolis city council announces intent to defund police 02:17\nNine members of the Minneapolis City Council say they intend to defund and dismantle the city's police department. Council President Lisa Bender says they may shift police funding toward community-based strategies instead, and discuss how to eventually replace the current police force -- though Bender stressed that is \"not in the short term.\" The nationwide spread of anti-racist protests have led to calls to defund or outright abolish police departments, and some cities are considering other changes. In New York City, Mayor Bill De Blasio says the city will move some of its funding from the New York Police Department to youth and social services. Last week, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti agreed to slash between $100 million to $150 million from the Los Angeles Police Department's proposed $1.86 billion budget.\n3. Coronavirus\nManufacturer: Only enough remdesivir for 200K patients worldwide 02:24\nThe US government's current supply of remdesivir, the only drug known to work against Covid-19, will run out at the end of the month according to a US Department of Health and Human Services official. Gilead Sciences, the company that makes the drug, is ramping up to make more, but it's unclear how much will be available this summer. In the long term, the company plans to have more than 500,000 treatment courses available by October, and more than a million by December.Though it's not a cure, remdesivir has been shown to reduce hospital stays for some Covid-19 patients. Meanwhile, the global coronavirus death toll passed 400,000 this weekend, a sobering reminder that, despite waves of reopenings, the pandemic is an ongoing threat.\n4. Economy\nUS economy added 2.5 million jobs in May 01:06\nEmployers added 3.1 million jobs in May, giving an unexpected boost to a battered labor market. But state and local governments are still cutting jobs, which could kill any real economic momentum. Among the growth last month, these two levels of government actually slashed more than half a million jobs. One analytics firm predicts 3 million more state and local jobs could be at risk in coming months, including first responders and in areas like social services, sanitation, health care, education and municipal services like libraries and parks. And while the economy might be doing better now, there may be more bad news around the corner. Economists believe a second wave of infections could deaden a rebound and put the American economy in new danger.\n5. South China Sea\nWhy it matters who owns the seas 03:48\nMaritime and military experts are worried that China is adopting increasingly forceful tactics in the South China Sea. The Asia Maritime Transparency Institute revealed Chinese and Malaysian ships were locked in a high-stakes standoff in the highly-contested area earlier this year. Beijing claims it was conducting \"normal activities in waters under Chinese jurisdiction,\" but Chinese vessels have been accused for years of hounding countries who try to explore in the areas of the South China Sea that China claims as its own. The Malaysia standoff was also one among many confrontational moves from the Chinese government in the region this year. The AMTI says these incidents could lead to larger conflicts with other powers in the area, including Malaysia or Indonesia.\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\nUFC Champion Conor McGregor is retiring\nAt least, for now.

He went on one Facetime date -- the girl, he said, seemed like she was \"just going through her matches ... like on a spreadsheet.\"\nBut on May 29, he had plans to meet up with a different match -- this time in person. A 28-year-old nurse named Brooke, with whom he would hike Runyon Canyon -- Los Angeles' picturesque, influencer-ridden trail.\nIt was in the middle of their approximately three-mile hike, when the two decided they felt comfortable enough to remove their face masks, that he knew this was different. Their guards were down, or as he described it, \"all caution (regarding coronavirus) was thrown to the wind.\"\nNow, less than one month and many dates later, they split most of their time between his West Hollywood apartment and hers in Long Beach. He's done what many initially considered impossible with social distancing guidelines and stay-at-home orders:\nHe found love during a global pandemic.\n\"This is truly two people finding their soulmate during the most unlikely of times,\" he told CNN in a phone interview. \"We're thinking about eloping to Vegas if the chapels open.\"\nSearching for love in the time of coronavirus\nWhile this may sound extreme, many formerly single people -- and dating experts -- say the pandemic has actually helped people find their matches more easily.\n\"I think people are more likely to find love during this time than not during this time,\" Yue Xu, co-host of the popular \"Dateable\" podcast, told CNN in a video call.\n\"Because we have this dedicated time to find love, there are no distractions -- you're not a bar looking at people around you or looking at your drink. Everyone's more present and they are more conscious about the way they are showing up to these virtual or real-life dates.\"\nXu and podcast co-host Julie Krafchick, who are based in San Francisco, said they've noticed an overall change for the better in terms of the dating landscape over the past few months.\n\"Consider this a reset,\" Xu said. \"Even though we're losing magic of that first date -- the first kiss, first touch -- we're forced to think about how we can reinvent dating.\"\nThe 'fail fast mentality'\nDating has never been -- and never will be -- perfect. Before the pandemic, Xu and Krafchick answered questions on their podcast such as \"Do Millennials even want to find love?\" and \"Is monogamy dead?\"\n\"We can't have amnesia that dating wasn't perfect before,\" Krafchick said. \"Part of the reason we created the podcast in the first place was to answer the question, 'What the f**k is wrong with modern dating?'\"\nThe biggest challenge for the singles out there before the pandemic, Krafchick said, was that many spent a lot of time in relationship limbo.\n\"No one wanted to say they were excited about someone,\" she said. \"No one wanted to define the relationship.\"\nNow, however, the pandemic has led to what Krafchick described as the \"fail fast mentality.\"\n\"People are starting to feel it's better to fail fast than be in this constant state of equilibrium,\" she said. \"Like, let's either get it off the ground or end it.\"\nYue Xu and Julie Krafchick host the \"Dateable\" podcast.\nThe podcast hosts have heard countless stories during these past few months of people who have successfully found love, and people who have felt more encouraged by their dating experiences even if their quarantine relationships didn't work out.\n\"Coming out of quarantine, everyone has a really strong feeling of a yes or no,\" Xu said.\nMany have also taken this time in quarantine to self reflect, which has helped pave the way to finding healthier relationships.\n\"I think this time has given people a lot of clarity into what they want in life,\" Krafchick said. \"It's shown life is short and at the end of the day, relationships are what matters most. A lot of people have used this time to do self work, especially in the dark middle period of quarantine, where it didn't feel like there was any way to meet someone.\"\nVirtual dates have also made people throw their old notions of dating out of the window, as they are forced to get creative. For example, \"there are 'Zootie' calls now,\" Xu explained. \"Zoom booty calls.\"\n'A whole other dimension of consent'\nWith this uncharted era of dating also comes new conversations around consent: Do you feel safe meeting in person during a pandemic? Do you agree to wearing masks on the first date? Do you feel comfortable being less than 6 feet apart?\nJessica Gerhardt, a Santa Monica, California, native, and her new partner -- they have not labeled the relationship yet -- waited three months before they decided to meet in person for the first time last week.\n\"He's way more conscientious than me,\" the musician said of the new guy in her life, who is also a musician.\nJessica Gerhardt and her new partner -- they have not labeled the relationship quite yet -- smile during one of the many video chats they had before meeting in person.\nThe two, who had mutual friends in the music scene, began talking after he \"slid into her DMs\" on Instagram. Before they met up, he researched and looked into data about social distancing, Gerhardt said.\n\"We both consented to hug when we first met,\" the 30-year-old told CNN. \"There's a whole other dimension of consent during this pandemic. Under normal circumstances, of course I'd want to hug -- but it was helpful to have that conversation before and nice to know if we don't do something it's not necessarily a sign of 'Oh, I'm not attracted or interested, but I'm trying to be considerate of your safety and vice versa.'\"\nThe lack of touching before meeting, Gerhardt said, made her feel like the two were cultivating \"deeper intimacy\" as they got to know each other.\nThey ended up going on a social distance walk in her neighborhood while both wore face masks. At the end of their walking date, he asked whether he could use her bathroom before he drove home.\n\"He came inside, and we both took off our masks after I asked, 'Do you feel comfortable being maskless?' and he said, 'I feel comfortable.' It was a nice surprise,\" she said. \"We ended up feeling comfortable enough to also hold hands and cuddle. It was really sweet.\"\nJessica Gerhardt snapped this photo on her first date with her new partner, where they took a walk in her neighborhood, while wearing masks.\nWhile they do not have plans to move in together any time soon, Gerhardt said he has now joined her quarantine pod, which includes her roommate and her roommate's boyfriend.\nLearning each other's values early on\nOn top of the pandemic, these past few months have seen nationwide protests demanding justice and an end to police brutality in the aftermath of the deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and Rayshard Brooks.\nHow people have acted during this time has helped provide a window into their beliefs, which for some singles has helped narrow down their pool of potential matches.\nLove under lockdown: The couples pushed together and kept apart by coronavirus\nFor example, on dating apps, many have said they have encountered photos of people holding \"Black Lives Matter\" signs at protests on their profiles. Others said they've seen people sporting face masks in their pictures, to highlight the fact that they are following social distancing guidelines recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in order to curb the spread of the virus.\n\"With the Black Lives Matter movement, Covid, and everything else that's been going on, it's been causing people to have way deeper conversations,\" Krafchick said. \"You can really quickly realize who has same values as you and who would be a better long-term partner. (Talking about) those things can really help you understand someone a lot better on a deeper level and get you past those basic dating questions.\"\nLiz Dwyer, who lives in LA, fell for a guy named Demis Courquet-Lesaulnier, who she has been messaging on Instagram since before the pandemic. He lives in Paris, and they had plans -- pre-coronavirus -- to meet abroad. Now, that plan has been put on hold.\nBut that hasn't slowed their relationship down at all. In fact, it's sped things up. Dwyer said she's gotten closer to her now-boyfriend these past few months virtually, thanks to many of the current events they discuss.\n\"We have completely different cultural backgrounds,\" the writer and editor told CNN. \"I'm American, he's French. I'm Black, he's White. We had to get to know each other -- not just on the 'I think you're good looking' and 'you're cute too' conversation.\"\nDwyer said Demis created a list of 54 films -- including \"BlacKkKlansman,\" \"13th\" and \"When They See Us\" -- \"to try and understand what it's like to be Black in America.\" The two have conversations about them, and discuss what he noticed, observed and learned from them. He even wrote a post titled \"A Love Letter to Black America\" to reflect on his takeaways.\n\"He was open to understanding what was happening in terms of racism,\" she said.\nWithout the pandemic, she doesn't know what their relationship would look like today.\n\"I don't know what the future holds,\" she added, \"but no matter what, the experience has changed me for the better.\"\nFinding your 'apocalypse partner'\nRonni Morgan, 32, and her partner Adriane (AJ) Johnson, 41, met on the HER app -- a dating app for queer people -- on March 23.\nThey started by texting, having FaceTime dates and watching Netflix together virtually, with Morgan in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and Johnson in Grand Rapids, Michigan.\nWhen they finally reached a point where they felt safe enough to start planning an in-person meeting, they found an AirBnB in between their two locations that they considered secluded and off-the-beaten path.\nFrom the beginning, Morgan said, the two were \"on the same page about how to handle the pandemic.\"\n\"We have both taken it very seriously,\" Morgan told CNN. \"I don't think we would've made it this far otherwise.\"\nWhen they finally did meet, on June 26, Morgan said their weekend together \"legitimately was like a lesbian romance novel, complete with a fireplace, velvety red blanket and epic thunderstorm.\"\n\"When we did finally get to meet in person, we were already so deeply connected there was no question of what the chemistry would be like,\" she told CNN.\nTheir relationship is still a long-distance one -- but Morgan said there's no doubt in her mind that she's found her \"apocalypse partner,\" aka the person to ride out the pandemic with.\n\"There's this meme that talks about how dating in 2020 is about choosing your apocalypse partner wisely and honestly I couldn't agree more,\" Morgan said. \"I can say, without a shadow of a doubt, there's no one I'd rather be braving the new world with than AJ.\"\nThe two have created a Facebook page and Instagram page dedicated to their love story.\n\"I never imagined I'd meet the love of my life during a global pandemic but here we are,\" Morgan wrote in a post sharing their story on Facebook.\n\"Anything is possible.\"\nMeeting at the virtual bar\nBack in March, Krafchick and Xu decided to bring their community of listeners together in a Facebook group they called \"Love in the Time of Corona by the Dateable Podcast.\" They said they felt it was important for people to feel less alone as quarantine began.\nYue Xu and Julie Krafchick take a selfie while hosting their podcast.\nSo far, the group has amassed more than 500 members -- who all actively utilize the group to share their experiences with dating in comments, over virtual happy hours, and, sometimes even with the two hosts as guests on their show.\nThursday afternoon, a \"Dateable\"-hosted virtual happy hour was in full swing, with about 20 people from across the United States -- some returning faces, others new to the hangout -- hopping on a video chat on Facebook.\nGroup members could check out different Facebook rooms, including: \"The Bar,\" where Krafchick and Xu kicked off the afternoon with intros. Then, some stayed behind to play a game of \"Would You Rather?\" with dating-themed questions.\n\"Would you rather date someone who is in a lot of debt but donates to charity on a regular basis,\" Xu asked the group, \"or someone who has no debt, but doesn't donate to charities?\"\nOthers joined the \"Playtime\" room, where they participated in dating-themed trivia. And some joined a new \"room\" called the \"Dance Floor,\" where one member taught a dance class."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/19/us/chicago-shootings-weekend/index.html", "headline": "Chicago shootings leave at least 49 people shot and seven dead this weekend", "published_date": "2020-07-19", "text": "(CNN)At least 49 people have been shot, including seven fatally, in incidents across Chicago this weekend, police said, continuing a trend of increased shootings and murders in the city.\nSeven teenagers, all boys, were among those wounded in multiple shootings reported since Friday evening, police said.\nOne victim, a 24-year-old woman, was standing on the sidewalk in a residential area \"when she heard shots (and) felt pain,\" police said in a statement. She went to Holy Cross Hospital with a gunshot wound to the left thigh and a gunshot wound to the buttocks. She is in fair condition, police said.\nHours earlier, a 35-year-old man was shot in the neck and died of his injuries at Northwestern Hospital. The man and a 25-year-old woman waved down police from a car after both had been shot around 2:35 a.m. Sunday, police said in a statement. The woman is in good condition but uncooperative with police, police said.\nThe violence fits a trend seen across major US cities this year: a sharp rise in shootings and murders in the past few months, even as overall crime complaints have declined. These trends coincide with the end of pandemic-related shutdowns and the mass protests against police violence and racism.\nHomicides are surging in US cities. Some say defunding the police will actually make it fall\nAs of July 12, Chicago police reported 385 murders this year, a 48% increase from at the same point in 2019, and 1,541 shootings, a 46% increase from the same point last year.\nThe increase has been particularly stark in the past month. There were 116 reported murders in the 28 days before July 12, about three times the murders in the same period in 2019.\nTotal crime complaints are down 9% compared to last year, led by steep declines in theft and criminal sexual assault incidents, according to Chicago police.\nCompared to 2016, crime complaints have declined 23%, with 10% more murders so far this year but 11% fewer shooting incidents. Historically, this year's murders and shootings are well below the heights of the 1990s, when crime peaked in US cities.\nCrime experts believe this year's increase in murders and shootings relates to the heightened distrust between police and the communities they serve, exemplified by Black Lives Matter protests across the country.\nRichard Rosenfeld, a criminologist at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, said it's highly likely that widespread social unrest in response to George Floyd's death and other police violence is contributing to an increase in violent crime. When people don't trust the police, he said, they're more likely to take matters in their own hands."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/30/us/minneapolis-business-support-protest-riot-gandhi-mahal-trnd/index.html", "headline": "Minneapolis businesses, including some that were damaged, are standing in solidarity with protesters", "published_date": "2020-05-31", "text": "(CNN)The death of George Floyd, an unarmed and handcuffed black man, while in Minneapolis police custody has triggered nights of protests and violence in cities across the country.\nIn Minneapolis, where former police officer Derek Chauvin has been charged in Floyd's death, demonstrators have voiced their anger in chants and on placards.

On January 10, 2017, he delivered the jury's recommendation that Roof be executed by lethal injection, which a judge accepted the next day. Roof has appealed his conviction and death sentence.\nWhile the outrage over Roof's hate-fueled slayings sparked change -- especially when it came to Confederate monuments and flags -- Truesdale was under no illusion the violence would end with Roof's death sentence, he said.\n\"It was more haunting to me than anything knowing that this probably wasn't the end,\" he said at a moment when the nation again is grappling with systemic racism. \"As unfortunate as it is, most of the people who do this kind of stuff, other than being mentally ill, just want to get attention.\"\nFor Truesdale and fellow jurors, simmering national protests over the continued unjust killings of black people have left them, he said, \"damned disgusted.\"\nMeeting a mass murderer\nOne year after Roof's sentencing, on the morning of January 10, 2018, Truesdale filled out the forms required to visit an inmate at United States Penitentiary, Terre Haute, where Roof sits on death row. His request was denied, he said. He tried twice more but never got a response.\n\"I'd like to let him meet me, and I would like very much to meet him,\" the 55-year-old said. \"It would be good for me personally for a little bit of closure -- not that I deserve closure.\"\nYou can't know what it's like to sign off on another man's death until you're charged with doing it, he said. It bothers him when people say he shouldn't feel bad because Roof deserves to die.\nFriend remembers Charleston victims 04:53\nWhatever you think of the 26-year-old white supremacist, he is someone's child, someone's brother, someone's grandkid, said Truesdale, who has two daughters and five grandchildren. He can't imagine being the father of a \"wicked murderer\" and feels for Roof's family, he said.\n\"Until you're the guy putting the needle in his arm, you don't have the right to say that. ... Until you're the one handing the judge the paper with your name on it, saying, 'This guy is done,'\" he paused, searching for the words, \"it's something different.\"\nSo, what would he say if his request to sit down with Roof were granted?\n\"It's not in my physical being to forgive him, but I want to let him know why it was done,\" Truesdale said.\nWhy it was done\nThere was minimal hesitation among the jurors deciding the young murderer's fate, Truesdale said. Roof was proud of his racism. He flaunted it. Given a chance to plead for forgiveness, he instead said, \"I felt like I had to do it, and I still do feel like I had to do it.\"\nThen there was Susie Jackson. What would possess a man, Truesdale asked, to fire 11 bullets into an 87-year-old woman?\n\"There is no remorse,\" he said. \"It was a very simple process.\"\nDylann Roof: 'I do not regret what I did' 03:39\nTruesdale also wants answers -- something he could take back to victims' relatives who didn't get a chance to communicate to Roof the depth of their loss -- though he doubts the killer would provide any.\n\"He's going to roll his eyes like he did the entire (trial),\" he said.\nWhile Truesdale doesn't take ordering Roof's execution lightly, it doesn't haunt him, either. He has often wondered if it would one day.\n\"I'm always sitting there wondering: At some point, are you going to look at this like something different should have been done?\" he said, but he always concludes, \"It was done exactly how it should've been done.\"\n'I made 17 siblings'\nAside from work and family, Truesdale has spent time in the last five years speaking at events and working with nonprofits that promote racial understanding and advocate for domestic violence survivors. He chats regularly with victims' relatives, Mother Emanuel pastor the Rev. Eric Manning, and Jennifer Berry Hawes, who wrote a book on the massacre's aftermath.\nHe's met heroes and survivors from other mass shootings, including police officers who responded last year in Christchurch, New Zealand, and Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, who survived the 2018 attack on Pittsburgh's Tree of Life synagogue.\nYet among his most cherished takeaway from the days he spent in the jury box are the bonds he forged with fellow jurors. He speaks with one of them at least weekly. They're united by more than friendship. They send cards when babies are born and when parents are ill.\nPastor: Charleston shooter 'pure evil' 01:14\n\"I made 17 siblings. It's beyond friends,\" Truesdale, an only child, said.\nThe 18 jurors -- 12 who sat on the panel and six alternates -- all live within 100 miles of Charleston and meet at least once a year, but they aim for two or three get-togethers annually. It might be for breakfast or a field trip. The meetups usually begin with fist pumps, and hugs and kisses.\n\"We don't talk about the trial. That was our only rule,\" Truesdale said.\nA month after US Judge Richard Gergel sentenced Roof to death, the group visited Mother Emanuel -- not as tourists but as parishioners.\nAs The Post and Courier in Charleston reported of the visit, \"They wanted to see the church as a house of worship, not a tomb.\"\n'It was bad enough then'\nThe jurors sometimes struggle to process the riots and protests surrounding the deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and other African Americans. It's been a \"tough couple months,\" Truesdale said, and they're checking on each other regularly to see how they're all coping.\nIf someone feels passionately about something, that person leads the conversation. There are no diatribes.\nVictims of church massacre laid to rest in Charleston 02:09\n\"It's just nice to be able to listen sometimes,\" Truesdale said.\nThe country is seeing too many black people killed over nothing, he said, and he and the other jurors find themselves \"damned disgusted with the process.\"\nIn their conversations, they've complained variously about the innocent people being hurt and killed, the agitators \"poking people with sticks and leaving the scene,\" the small businesses suffering so much of the riots' destruction and how poorly governments are handling the outrage.\n\"We've gone through this way too much here lately,\" he said. \"It was bad enough then, but now with all this, it sort of hits you in a different place.\"\nTruesdale wants an end to the violence, but there are \"too many crazies,\" he said, and he's afraid it will only continue.\nIt's not enough, he finds, for people to say they support Black Lives Matter. There's so much virtue signaling today, he wants to know why they feel black lives matter -- and he asks them.\nHonoring the lives lost in the Charleston shooting 01:28\n\"I need to understand why they think that,\" he said. \"Anybody can put a bumper sticker on a car or wear a hat or T-shirt.\"\nThe answer he wants to hear?\n\"Because they're abused. They as a people, they as a race, they've been abused. If you can't answer why, then you're really not committed to the process, in my opinion.\""}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/30/us/san-jose-officers-racist-posts/index.html", "headline": "4 San Jose officers are on leave while Facebook posts are investigated", "published_date": "2020-06-30", "text": "(CNN)Four San Jose Police Department officers are on administrative leave while their department investigates comments made in a private Facebook group reportedly for current and former San Jose officers, the department confirmed to CNN Monday.\nThe reportedly racist and anti-Muslim comments allegedly made by current and retired SJPD officers came to light when purported screenshots of the posts were shared online in an anonymous article posted on the website Medium by a person claiming to be \"the partner of an active law enforcement officer in a San Francisco Bay Area police department.\"\nIn the images posted with the Medium article, users made disparaging comments about Muslim women and one person changed their cover photo to a picture of a \"Sharia Barbie\" doll with a black eye wearing a hijab.\nOn a post about a Los Angeles Muslim woman's hijab being pulled off by an officer, one person replied, \"I say re-purpose the hijabs into nooses.\"\nThe article also contained an image that it says is from a public post in which the user comments, \"black lives really don't matter.\"\nCNN has not been able to view the posts in question and has not identified any current or former officer involved.\nSan Jose Police Chief Eddie Garcia expressed outrage over the comments and warned that any officers who are found to have been involved could be fired.\n\"I have previously responded with discipline up to termination after an investigation into off duty online activity that runs counter to our standards of conduct,\" Garcia said in a statement.\n\"While I have no control over what former employees post online, I can voice my outrage after hearing about these comments made online,\" the police chief said. \"Any current employee involved with bigoted activity online will promptly be investigated and held accountable to the fullest extent in my power.

George Floyd\nGeorge Floyd will be laid to rest today in Houston as ongoing protests spurred by his death in police custody are putting pressure on politicians to effect real change. House Democrats put forth sweeping legislation aimed at cracking down on police brutality and recording misuse of force, the first concrete step toward action from Washington as a national movement emerges. The increased attention to the Black Lives Matter movement and racial parity is already changing the landscape in other industries. Four top media editors have resigned in recent days over issues of diversity and how people of color are treated at their companies.\nHide Caption\n53 of 53\nPhotos: Remembering George Floyd\nPallbearers bring George Floyd's casket into the Fountain of Praise church in Houston on Tuesday, June 9.

Police reform\nPowerful police unions across the country are digging in as political and public attention shifts toward reform. Police unions in the US wield significant political power and enjoy higher membership rates than many other unions, which could lead to significant political clashes as cities explore changes to police departments. Cities like Minneapolis, Los Angeles and New York are already making changes, but leaders of other cities like Atlanta and Houston say there are other ways to address issues raised by recent events. In Florida, a chapter of the Fraternal Order of Police said it is open to hiring officers who have been fired or quit over alleged misconduct. Among those are the Buffalo 57, dozens of officers from the New York city who resigned after two officers were suspended after they were filmed pushing a 75-year-old protester to the ground.\nDemocrats propose legislation to reform police force 02:09\n3. Coronavirus\nThe World Health Organization says the spread of the coronavirus through asymptomatic carriers appears to be rare, upending a lot of assumptions about how the virus spreads. Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO's technical lead for coronavirus response, said data from detailed contact tracing programs -- that is, programs that track whom infected people come in contact with -- shows very few secondary infections caused by people with no symptoms. However, other experts point out there is a difference between truly asymptomatic carriers and people who haven't shown symptoms yet or have extremely mild ones. Meanwhile, 22 US states have seen their case numbers jump back up in recent days following reopenings and relaxed guidelines. Florida alone has seen a 46% increase in cases over the last week.\nBlack light experiment shows how quickly a virus spreads 02:13\n4. Economy\nThe US is officially in a recession, economists have declared, but there's some good news, too. US stocks actually rallied on the announcement, pushing some indices to record highs and effectively erasing 2020 losses. Airline stocks are also rising as Americans prepare to take to the skies again, hopefully signaling an end to months of near-paralysis in the industry. All in all, this strong start to the week is a continuation of the remarkable turnaround for US stocks, which plunged into a bear market in mid-March. The Federal Reserve is set to meet tomorrow to discuss any future plans to shore up the economy.

This includes shuttering several military-to-military hotlines, plus another phone line meant to directly connect North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in at a moment's notice. Officials in Pyongyang say they're giving Seoul the cold shoulder because North Korean defectors in South Korea flew balloons over the border carrying leaflets and SD cards, likely with information about the outside world.

Before submitting, users must add a report describing the location of the incident, who was involved, names of the officers in the video if known, and any additional details.\nUsers can also report an incident they witnessed and learn more about their rights to take photos and videos with audio recordings, which differ from state to state.\nIn the upcoming months, the app -- which is currently available in 17 states and the District of Columbia -- will be accessible to everyone in all 50 states while respecting each state's laws, Benigno said.\nAlong with capturing misconduct, the Mobile Justice app also helps deescalate situations between law enforcement and citizens.\n\"The initial goal was to make sure abuses from law enforcement were caught on camera, so we can ultimately reform the system, but what we're seeing is it's not just about capturing abuse,\" Benigno said.\n\"It's become a deescalation tool.

But 155 years after the news of their emancipation finally reached slaves in Galveston, Texas, the nation is still struggling with the issues of systemic racism and injustice.\nThat struggle surfaced once again in the national debate and massive Black Lives Matter protests that were sparked by the killing of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police officers on May 25.\nForty-seven states and the District of Columbia mark June 19 as a state holiday or observance. Communities across the country celebrate it with food and festivities. But -- despite a push by activists over the years -- Juneteenth still isn't a federal holiday. And, throughout its history, it has often been overlooked by non-black Americans.\nHere's what to know about Juneteenth.\nWhat Juneteenth is\nJuneteenth -- a blending of the words June and nineteenth -- is the oldest regular US celebration of the end of slavery.\nIt commemorates June 19, 1865: the day that Union Army Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger rode into Galveston, Texas, and told slaves of their emancipation.\nJuneteenth: 8 places to honor the end of slavery\n\"In accordance with a proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free,\" Granger read to a crowd.\nThat day came more than two years after President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863. Even after Lincoln declared all enslaved people free on paper, that hadn't necessarily been the case in practice.\nAfrican Americans and others mark Juneteenth -- also called Emancipation Day -- much like the Fourth of July, with parties, picnics and gatherings with family and friends.\nJuneteenth has been celebrated informally since 1865, but Texas became the first state to make it a state holiday in 1980.\nWhy people are talking about it now\nFor one thing, it's right around the corner.\nAnd on Thursday, President Donald Trump announced that he would hold a June 19 campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma -- the site of one of the worst acts of racist violence the country has ever seen.\n99 years ago today, America was shaken by one of its deadliest acts of racial violence\nIn 1921, tensions between Tulsa's black and white communities culminated in a white mob attacking black residents and burning black-owned businesses in a part of the city known as \"Black Wall Street.\"\nTrump's decision to hold the rally there on a day that commemorates the end of slavery was striking, given events in the aftermath of Floyd's killing. The President has remained mostly silent on issues of systemic racism and has resisted some of the changes proposed by protesters.\nDemocratic lawmakers and progressives sharply criticized the move.\n\"This isn't just a wink to white supremacists -- he's throwing them a welcome home party,\" Sen.

But the most difficult question may be the one they're asking themselves.\nGoogle says searches for the term, \"Am I racist,\" have spiked in recent weeks to an all-time high. Floyd's death at the hands of a White police officer has sparked a racial awakening in the US. Support for the Black Lives Matter movement has surged, and White people are snapping up books like \"How to Be an Antiracist\" and \"White Fragility.\"\nBut a Google search and a few books can only go so far in answering such a complex and loaded query.\nSo CNN called some activists, psychologists and historians and asked them: How would you help White people answer that question?\nFirst, let's define racism\nThe first step in self-knowledge is defining what it means to be a racist, and defining racism itself.\nWornie Reed, a veteran civil rights activist and the director of the Race and Social Policy Center at Virginia Tech, says, \"A racist person is a person who commits racist acts.\"\nThose acts, he says, are backed by a set of beliefs that support the idea that race determines human traits and capacities and makes one race automatically superior to another.\n\"If they do racist things, I'm willing to call them a racist,\" Reed says. \"You can be a racist even if you don't intend to be one.\"\nA protester holds up a homemade sign during a march on June 12, 2020, in New York City.\nAnd racism? It's not one thing but many.\nIt's a system of advantage based on race, scholars say. It's a collection of stereotypes, prejudices and discriminatory behavior. It's overt and covert. And it operates across an individual, group and societal level.\nThe truth? Everyone has some racist attitudes\nHere's the bad news if you are one of those people asking, \"Am I racist?\"\n\"If you have to ask if you are a racist, you are,\" says Angela Bell, an assistant professor of psychology at Lafayette College in Pennsylvania. \"And if you are not asking if you are a racist, you are.\"\nEverybody living in the United States has internalized stereotypes about Black people.\nMark Naison, professor\nBell's paradoxical response is part of what she and others say about racism: It's almost impossible not to be a racist growing up in the US.

I've got to work on myself.\"\nA lot of anti-racism work today leads to talk about \"implicit bias,\" or \"racial bias.\" Those are terms that describe how racial stereotypes and assumptions infiltrate our subconscious. People can act and think in racist ways without knowing it.\nA protester raises his fist during a rally June 1, 2020, in Las Vegas.\nA classic example of this was a famous experiment in which researchers sent 5,000 fictitious resumes in response to employment ads. Some applicants had White-sounding names such as \"Brendan,\" while others had Black-sounding names, like \"Jamal.\"\nThe applicants with White-sounding names were 50% more likely to get calls for interviews than their Black-sounding counterparts.\nPeople might not think that they have control over racism, and they can't ever get rid of it. It's absolutely within their control.\nAngela Bell, psychology professor\nSome scholars, though, have issues with terms like \"implicit bias.\" They feel it offers people an excuse to justify their racism by claiming, \"My subconscious made me do it.\"\n\"The term racial bias perpetuates the notion that racism is beyond your control, and that's often not the case,\" says Bell, the psychology professor. \"People might not think that they have control over racism, and they can't ever get rid of it. It's absolutely within their control.\"\nIt doesn't matter if you voted for Obama\nIt can be fiendishly difficult, though, for people to see racism in themselves, says Bell, who studies how people fail to recognize their own racism.\nSome of that is because of what psychologists call \"moral licensing and credentialing.\" Translation: A White liberal who brags, \"I would have voted for Obama a third time if I could,\" may be trying to signal that he or she is beyond racism.\nIf you bring Mother Teresa out of the grave and put her in charge of any criminal justice system in any state, she would be -- unless she changed the system -- the greatest practicing racist in the state.\nWornie Reed, activist and scholar\nIn 2009, Stanford University researchers released a study which found that expressing support for Obama made some people feel justified in favoring Whites over Blacks.\nDaniel Effron, who helped conduct the study, said at the time:\n\"This is the psychological equivalent of when people in casual conversation say something like, 'many of my best friends are black.' They say that because they're about to say something else that they're concerned might be construed as prejudiced.\"\nSupporters wave \"Forward\" signs as President Barack Obama speaks at a rally on September 2, 2012, in Boulder, Colorado.\nThere's also the tendency for people to evaluate themselves as superior to others, Bell says.\nShe cites an experiment she helped conduct in which she asked college students to fill out an online questionnaire asking if they had ever engaged in racist behaviors, such as using the N-word.\nMonths later, the same participants were asked to review similar responses from randomly selected students. The catch was that they were actually reviewing their own answers, but they didn't know it.\n\"People evaluated themselves as less racist as the other person,\" Bell says, \"even though the other person was them.\"\nIndividual racism isn't as harmful as institutional racism\nPeople have different ideas about how to get rid of racism. Some say the focus should be on institutional racism -- in schools, policing, the workplace -- and not on people's feelings.\nReed says too many White Americans see \"racism as psychology\" -- a naval-gazing definition that focuses on what people feel inside and personal displays of racial hostility, like racial slurs.\nReed says the goal of the civil rights movement was not to make White people better. It was to purge institutions of racism so that Blacks could have equal access to jobs, housing and education.\nA segregated theater in Leland, Mississippi, in the 1930s.\nNot enough White Americans understand that racism is much more destructive when it infects an institution like the criminal justice system, he says.\n\"If you bring Mother Teresa out of the grave and put her in charge of any criminal justice system in any state,\" he says, \"she would be -- unless she changed the system -- the greatest practicing racist in the state.\"\nHow to tell if you're racist\nA Google search for \"Am I a racist\" offers a quiz, but racist attitudes are too complex to diagnose like that. Naison, however, poses a few questions that may give you a clue.\nAre you surprised when you meet a Black person whose command of language or speech or writing is of the highest order?\nDo you assume that when you meet a Black person in an athletic competition that he or she will be stronger or faster than you?\nDo you feel anxiety when a group of young Black men walk down the street toward you, or a twinge of fear when a Black man checks your gas meter or does home repairs?\nA woman holds a protest sign in Oakland, California, on June 1, 2020.\nIf you answered yes to these you might be a racist, Naison says.\nHe adds that Black people who come in contact with you will probably know you're a racist before you do. Blacks can often read White people's body language when they're experiencing these racist thoughts, he says. It could be something as simple as speeding up your walk when a Black man approaches on the street or hesitating to open your door when a Black man is ringing the bell.\nNaison says a majority of Whites practice what he calls \"aversive racism,\" or engaging in behavior -- some of it unconscious -- \"which lets Black people know they are uncomfortable around them.\"\nHow to not be racist\nOne of the biggest obstacles to fighting racism is despair. There's a belief that racism will never be eliminated because it always adapts to survive, and humans are too tribal to look past superficial differences in others.\nBut the modern framework of racism -- a racial hierarchy with White on top and Black on bottom -- is a relatively recent fabrication. The notion that people with darker skin are inherently inferior was contrived around 500 years ago by Europeans to justify slavery and colonial conquest, scholars say.\nHistory lessons won't prevent someone from being a racist. But something else can: genuine, sustained personal relationships with people of color.\nSustained friendships with people of other races can break down biases, scholars say.\n\"Reading books is a good thing, and participating in study groups is fine, but making your social networks genuinely diverse is critical,\" says Naison, the Fordham professor. \"You can't live in a White bubble.\"\nMost White people, however, are socially isolated from people of other ethnicities, he says. Naison says he goes to the homes and celebrations of White friends and hardly ever sees any people of color.\n\"And these are people who support every possible justice issue, and who march in Black Lives Matter protests,\" he says.\nNaison says he's never had to ask Google, \"Am I a racist?\" because his world is full of people of color who will tell him if he is being a racist.\n\"I've had a great life and I've learned to make this happen,\" he says. \"If I can do it, you can too.\"\nMaybe starting that journey begins with a less self-centered question for Google.\nInstead of \"Am I racist?\" ask yourself:\nWhat am I doing to stop the racism I see in the world?"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/23/us/minneapolis-police-union-intvu/index.html", "headline": "Four weeks after George Floyd's death, an embattled police union finally speaks out", "published_date": "2020-06-23", "text": "Minneapolis (CNN)Nearly a month after the death of George Floyd at the hands of law enforcement, and after repeatedly refusing requests for comment on an incident that sparked nationwide calls for policing reform, officials from the Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis are breaking their silence.\n'Scapegoats'\nIn an interview Monday with CNN, union officials said they are being unfairly vilified by critics of the Minneapolis police department, and blasted local elected officials who have called for major reform of the department, even as union representatives offered little by way of specific policing reforms they would be willing to support.\n\"We have become scapegoats in this,\" said Bob Kroll, police union president, adding, \"the people to blame lays squarely (sic) on the shoulders of our political leadership.\"\nMinneapolis became a flashpoint for criminal justice reform advocates after Floyd was killed during an encounter with at least four of the city's police officers. In eyewitness video footage of the incident, former officer Derek Chauvin was seen pressing his knee to the Black man's neck for nearly eight minutes as Floyd lost consciousness.\nOfficer in George Floyd's death under review by state police conduct board\nChauvin was charged by prosecutors with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. The three other officers were charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder, and aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter.\nAsked by CNN about what went through his mind as he watched the video of Floyd being killed, police union representative Rich Walker said he was \"horrified.\"\n\"I don't know what was going through Officer Chauvin's mind, but I can say that I don't agree with how it ended,\" said Walker. \"And to this day I still believe that Mr. Floyd should still be here.\"\nThose comments were echoed by Kroll; however, he stopped short of indicating what he thinks should happen to Chauvin -- instead insisting that he did not want to pass judgment on the former officer.\n\"There was a firefighter at the scene saying, you know, 'check him, check him'. The light should have went (sic) off to do that, but we're not going to pass judgment,\" Kroll said. \"The justice system is going to prevail.\"\nBlasting city leadership\nIn attempting to defend Minneapolis police officers from what they view as unfair criticism, union officials took aim at the city's mayor and members of the city council who have recently called for the restructuring of the police department.\nUnion representatives also criticized Minneapolis police department leadership over their decision to allow rioters to set fire to the city's 3rd police precinct building without a show of force by officers to protect the building.\nSgt. Anna Hedberg, a director at the union, said there were officers scrambling to get their belongings out of the 3rd precinct before it fell. \"That's just ... that was one of the hardest things to ever watch in my career,\" Hedberg said.\n\"To watch 54 cops that shouldn't have been there get chased down the street because the failed politicians allowed them to be there, knowing full well that they weren't going to send the resources,\" she said.\nWhile police union leaders had no shortage of complaints against politicians who have been vocal in calling for policing reforms in the wake of Floyd's death, union leaders were unwilling to outline any specific proposals they would currently be willing to support.\nCorrections officers say they were barred from Derek Chauvin's floor because of their skin color\nAfter the killing of Floyd, the Minnesota governor called a special session of the state's legislature in hopes of pressing forward on a package of possible reforms, including reducing police violence, and efforts geared towards ensuring greater police accountability and transparency. Those efforts appeared to stall as the special session came to a close late last week with numerous reform bills still pending.\nAsked repeatedly by CNN what pieces of legislation they would support, Minneapolis police union officials said they had not yet had time to read the multiple bills put before the state's legislative bodies, and warned that hastily rushing through policing reform measures could have unintended consequences.\n\"We need time,\" said Kroll, adding, \"everybody's got to take a breath.\"\nA controversial president\nEven before the police encounter that resulted in the death of George Floyd, union president Bob Kroll found himself in the national spotlight for both controversial public statements and for actively engaging in partisan campaigning for President Donald Trump.\nPresident Donald Trump shakes hands with Minneapolis Police Union head Bob Kroll on stage during a campaign rally at the Target Center on October 10, 2019 in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\nIn 2016, Kroll referred to Black Lives Matter -- the diffuse group now responsible for organizing many of the primarily peaceful protests against police violence across the country -- as a \"terrorist organization,\" and said he did not see BLM as \"a voice for the black community in Minneapolis.\"\nAsked by CNN whether he stood by those comments, Kroll doubled down, saying he equates parts of the Black Lives Matter movement with domestic terrorism.\nKroll also defended his attendance on stage at a 2019 Trump campaign rally in Minnesota, saying he and his colleagues were unhappy with a statement at the time by the city's mayor indicating Trump was not welcome in the city.\n\"The Obama administration and the handcuffing and oppression of police was despicable,\" Kroll said as he stood next to the President wearing a 'Cops for Trump' shirt. \"The first thing President Trump did when he took office was turn that around,\" he added.\nIn 2007, Kroll was named in a racial discrimination lawsuit from five Minneapolis African American officers, in which they allege Kroll referred to then-US Rep. Keith Ellison as a \"terrorist.\" Ellison, who is now Minnesota's attorney general, is a Black Muslim -- and has promised to \"hold everyone accountable\" in the Floyd case.\nThe same lawsuit also accused Kroll of wearing a motorcycle jacket with \"white power\" written on it. Kroll denied the allegations and the lawsuit was settled for $740,000.\nIn 2004, Kroll was named in another lawsuit for excessive use of force against a man who allegedly brushed against his car. Kroll and another officer, who were both off-duty, allegedly shoved and kicked the man to the ground. Kroll denied any wrongdoing.\nA 2015 review of Kroll's 26 years on the force by the Minneapolis Star Tribune found 20 internal affairs complaints against him, all but three closed without any disciplinary action having been taken.\nMultiple investigations\nWhile union officials continue to defend their department's credibility following Floyd's death and the criminal charging of four of the city's police officers, scrutiny of the embattled department is likely to continue on multiple fronts.\nIn addition to the state's criminal investigation of Floyd's death, the FBI is actively pursuing a concurrent civil rights investigation of the incident. Furthermore, the Minnesota department of human rights continues to investigate whether there is a pattern of police officers in Minneapolis unfairly discriminating against people of color.\nStill, union officials say none of the recent events, nor the litany of investigations of the department should result in broad-brushing the city's police officers.\n\"We need people to quit categorizing police and the police profession as these violent racists and quit demonizing police for what they do,\" said Sherral Schmidt, union vice-president, to who again put the onus on politicians, adding the city's elected officials should \"spend more time looking at ways to get the community and the police engaged together so that we can move forward to developing safer communities for the people of Minneapolis.\""}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/04/us/mcmichaels-hearing-ahmaud-arbery/index.html", "headline": "Ahmaud Arbery was hit with a truck before he died, and his killer allegedly used a racial slur, investigator testifies", "published_date": "2020-06-04", "text": "(CNN)William Bryan told investigators he heard Travis McMichael use a racial epithet after fatally shooting Ahmaud Arbery in Glynn County, a Georgia Bureau of Investigation agent testified Thursday at a preliminary hearing.\nBryan told police Travis McMichael said \"f***ing n***er\" after three blasts from his shotgun left Arbery dead in the street in the Satilla Shores neighborhood in February, GBI Assistant Special Agent in Charge Richard Dial testified.

Dial did not say to whom McMichael was referring and was not asked for more context.\nBryan, too, had several messages on his phone that included \"racial\" terms and indicated he may have prejudged Arbery when he saw him that day, Dial said.\n\"There's evidence of Mr. Bryan's racist attitude in his communications, and from that I extrapolate the reason why he made assumptions he did that day,\" he said. \"He saw a man running down the road with a truck following him, and I believe he made certain assumptions that were, at least in part, based upon his racial bias.\"\nArbery's mother, Wanda Cooper, was devastated when she heard Dial's testimony, she said.\n\"I often imagine the last minutes of my son's life. I didn't imagine it would be that harsh, but to learn that that statement was made in the last seconds of his life ... it was very heartbreaking,\" she said.\nScores of protesters gathered outside the courthouse after the hearing, and they could be heard chanting, \"All lives matter when black lives matter,\" according to CNN affiliate WJXT.\nThe pursuit\nDial outlined events that led to Arbery's death and said that before Arbery was shot, the three men charged in his murder engaged in an elaborate chase, hitting the 25-year-old jogger with a truck as he tried to escape them.\nAsked whether he believed McMichael could've been acting in self-defense, Dial said the opposite was true.\n\"I believe Mr. Arbery was being pursued, and he ran till he couldn't run anymore, and it was turn his back to a man with a shotgun or fight with his bare hands against the man with the shotgun.

He does, with all due respect, what any patriotic American would have done under the same circumstances,\" Gough said.\nArbery tried to escape, agent says\nThough Bryan's attorney has argued his client took no part in the killing, Dial said Bryan yelled to the McMichaels, \"Do you got him?\" when he saw them chasing the 25-year-old jogger.\nAfter yelling out to the McMichaels, Bryan joined the chase, at which point none of the three had called 911, Dial said.\nAhmaud Arbery's father: His death was a modern-day lynching 03:22\nThe McMichaels had already tried to head off Arbery once when Bryan joined the pursuit, the GBI agent said. Bryan tried to block in Arbery as Travis McMichael drove around the block with his father in the bed of the truck, he said.\nBryan \"made several statements about trying to block him in and using his vehicle to try to stop him,\" Dial said. \"His statement was that Mr. Arbery kept jumping out of the way and moving around the bumper and actually running down into the ditch in an attempt to avoid his truck.\"\nAt one point, Arbery was heading out of the Satilla Shores neighborhood where the defendants live, but the McMichaels forced him to turn back into the neighborhood and run past Bryan, the agent said. That is when he struck Arbery, Dial said, and Arbery kept running with the McMichaels in pursuit.\nBryan turned around, and that is when the widely disseminated video of Arbery's killing begins, he said.\nWhen police arrived after the shooting, Dial said, Gregory McMichael said in remarks caught on police body camera footage that he didn't know for certain if Arbery had stolen anything.\n\"He had a gut feeling that Mr. Arbery may have been responsible for thefts that were in the neighborhood previously.

He's been featured on National Public Radio and in Time magazine and has written columns for GQ.\nRacism is a painful topic that can grind down those who write and talk about it for a living. Not so with Young. His columns are insightful and playful, and he's not afraid to criticize Black athletes or public figures. His writings also transcend race, such as a coming-of-age column from last year entitled, \"The Last Time I Got into a Fight.\"\nCNN asked Young five questions about being a Black man at this unique moment in history. Our interview was lightly edited for clarity.\nIs this current willingness by White America to acknowledge anti-Black racism just a passing phase, or do you think it represents a shift that will endure?\nIt's trendy now, today, for White people to be antiracist. It's a status symbol, like owning a Peloton or having a Black friend who has Black friends. But what happens when we move past the gesture, and the incentive to do the rigorous work it requires is a bit cloudier, a bit messier, and the social gratification is less immediate?\nBasically, does this current willingness have integrity? I hope so, but \"hope\" is a few thousand miles from \"believe.\"\nWhat's the difference between this country having a true racial reckoning versus a superficial racial reckoning?\nA true racial reckoning includes, interrogates and eventually extinguishes all systems of oppression. That includes capitalism. That includes patriarchy. It's not carpet cleansing. It's carpet bombing.\nTree of Life Rabbi Myers: A better future requires all of us 00:53\nIf Trump is defeated in November, do you think the Republican Party will abandon White grievance or do you think there will be a Trump 2.0 down the road who will be more sophisticated and less obvious?\nWhen you think of him as less singular and more an element on a continuum of sentient White grievance -- instead of Donald Trump 1.0, he's Woodrow Wilson 9.0 -- the answer is obvious: Of course, the next version is coming. Maybe they're already here.\nWhat is the most difficult part of constantly explaining racism to White people?\nI don't write with the intent of explaining race and racism to White people. I write to articulate and better understand the circus in and outside of my head. I write for catharsis. I write to challenge myself. I write to entertain myself.\nEven when I'm literally writing a race-related explainer, like the one on the difference between a \"Karen\" and a \"Becky\" (a Becky \"weaponizes\" her White privilege while convincing herself that her Whiteness doesn't matter; a Karen \"doesn't even bother to fake it\"), I'm writing to create a thing I'd like to read.\nIf White people leave my work with a greater understanding of race and racism, that's great.\nBut their education is incidental -- the rub, not the steak. And perhaps that's the lesson. That my world revolves around me, not them.\nWe've seen a lot of videos on social media of White people becoming belligerent and even threatening when they're asked to wear a mask in public. Why do you think some freak out when asked to wear masks?\nI think White people have never had to be guests. I'm one of those people who hate the \"shoes-off\" house. I go to someone's party or dinner and I'm asked to leave the shoes at the door. I get annoyed because my shoes are part of my outfit. But their house; their rules.\nOne of the things that's happening in America now is that White people have never been asked to be guests. This all connects back to White supremacy and Manifest Destiny, where people feel that everything they see they have a right to. \"You can't tell me what to do -- I'm a White American.\" And having some pushback against that is causing some hysteria.\nYou watch these videos and it's like, just put on your mask.

An organizer said the demonstration was meant to be inclusive and socially distant, in light of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\"Covid-19 is real,\" organizer Ron Gochez told CNN. \"We wanted people to be careful. That's why this is another way we can show our solidarity with the black community and the movement against police terrorism.\"\nThe damage and looting that overshadowed the earlier days of unrest have mostly subsided and some cities have done away with curfews, including New York.\nThe city lifted its curfew from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. \"effective immediately,\" Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Twitter Sunday morning. His announcement came after several days of largely peaceful demonstrations.\nChicago, Philadelphia, and Buffalo, New York, also lifted curfews Sunday.\nBlack Lives Matter supporters gather across globe 02:24\nSaturday's protests drew some of the largest crowds since the demonstrations began -- especially in Washington, DC. But chants of \"Black Lives Matter\" were not only heard in US this weekend, but in cities around the globe, including in France, Germany, England, Australia and Canada.\nDespite experts' concerns about coronavirus spread, the peaceful crowds decrying police brutality and demanding both justice for George Floyd and sweeping changes within the country's policing systems continue to swell in size.\nSome police departments suspend tear gas use\nAs the protests enter day 13, some cities have begun rolling out new rules for officers or plans of reform, prompted by both the demonstrations and the violent police response they've been met with, including tear gas and rubber bullets.\nPolice forces all over the US have come under fire for their use of excessive force during the protests -- the very thing demonstrators say they are speaking out against.\nMayor de Blasio said Sunday that two NYPD officers were suspended without pay due to their actions while policing protesters. One was accused of shoving a woman to the ground in Brooklyn last Friday, while the other was accused of pulling down a protester's face covering and spraying the protester with pepper spray.\nBoth officers face further disciplinary action, de Blasio said. Additionally, a supervisor in charge of the officer who pushed the woman has been reassigned.\nIn just a week, footage showed police in Buffalo, New York, push an elderly protester to the ground, causing him to bleed from the head. In Fort Lauderdale, Florida, an officer was placed on administrative leave after shoving a kneeling protester during a demonstration. And in Kansas City, Missouri, footage shows officers using pepper spray and restraining a man who was yelling about police using excessive force.\nDare we believe that this time will be different?\nOn Saturday, Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler directed the city's police chief to stop using tear gas to disperse crowds \"unless there is a serious and immediate threat to life safety, and there is no other viable alternative for dispersal.\"\n\"I stand in solidarity with our non-violent demonstrators, who are sending a strong message that we are long overdue for meaningful reform and restorative justice,\" the mayor tweeted.\nPortland is the latest US city to move away from the tactic.\nThe Seattle police chief said Friday she suspended the department's use of tear gas for crowd management for at least the next month. And in Denver, a federal judge granted a temporary restraining order prohibiting the use of \"chemical weapons or projectiles of any kind\" against peaceful protesters.\nThe order comes after four Denver residents who participated in demonstrations filed a complaint Thursday challenging the department's use of chemical agents and rubber projectiles during protests.\nPresident Donald Trump on Sunday tweeted that he had ordered the National Guard to withdraw from the nation's capital following days of peaceful protests. Around 5,000 troops were sought to patrol Washington, approximately 3,900 of which were from out of state.\nTrump did not specify whether all forces would be withdrawn or just those from out-of-state.\nHis comments came are Maj. Gen. William Walker, commander of the DC National Guard, told CNN Saturday that out-of-state troops would begin leaving as soon as Monday.\nSimilar steps were taken in Los Angeles.

Not so with Young. His columns are insightful and playful, and he's not afraid to criticize Black athletes or public figures. His writings also transcend race, such as a coming-of-age column from last year entitled, \"The Last Time I Got into a Fight.\"\nCNN asked Young five questions about being a Black man at this unique moment in history. Our interview was lightly edited for clarity.\nIs this current willingness by White America to acknowledge anti-Black racism just a passing phase, or do you think it represents a shift that will endure?\nIt's trendy now, today, for White people to be antiracist. It's a status symbol, like owning a Peloton or having a Black friend who has Black friends. But what happens when we move past the gesture, and the incentive to do the rigorous work it requires is a bit cloudier, a bit messier, and the social gratification is less immediate?\nBasically, does this current willingness have integrity? I hope so, but \"hope\" is a few thousand miles from \"believe.\"\nWhat's the difference between this country having a true racial reckoning versus a superficial racial reckoning?\nA true racial reckoning includes, interrogates and eventually extinguishes all systems of oppression. That includes capitalism. That includes patriarchy. It's not carpet cleansing. It's carpet bombing.\nTree of Life Rabbi Myers: A better future requires all of us 00:53\nIf Trump is defeated in November, do you think the Republican Party will abandon White grievance or do you think there will be a Trump 2.0 down the road who will be more sophisticated and less obvious?\nWhen you think of him as less singular and more an element on a continuum of sentient White grievance -- instead of Donald Trump 1.0, he's Woodrow Wilson 9.0 -- the answer is obvious: Of course, the next version is coming. Maybe they're already here.\nWhat is the most difficult part of constantly explaining racism to White people?\nI don't write with the intent of explaining race and racism to White people. I write to articulate and better understand the circus in and outside of my head. I write for catharsis. I write to challenge myself. I write to entertain myself.\nEven when I'm literally writing a race-related explainer, like the one on the difference between a \"Karen\" and a \"Becky\" (a Becky \"weaponizes\" her White privilege while convincing herself that her Whiteness doesn't matter; a Karen \"doesn't even bother to fake it\"), I'm writing to create a thing I'd like to read.\nIf White people leave my work with a greater understanding of race and racism, that's great.\nBut their education is incidental -- the rub, not the steak. And perhaps that's the lesson. That my world revolves around me, not them.\nWe've seen a lot of videos on social media of White people becoming belligerent and even threatening when they're asked to wear a mask in public. Why do you think some freak out when asked to wear masks?\nI think White people have never had to be guests. I'm one of those people who hate the \"shoes-off\" house. I go to someone's party or dinner and I'm asked to leave the shoes at the door. I get annoyed because my shoes are part of my outfit. But their house; their rules.\nOne of the things that's happening in America now is that White people have never been asked to be guests. This all connects back to White supremacy and Manifest Destiny, where people feel that everything they see they have a right to. \"You can't tell me what to do -- I'm a White American.\" And having some pushback against that is causing some hysteria.\nYou watch these videos and it's like, just put on your mask. For the five minutes you're in Trader Joe's getting your gluten-free lettuce wraps, just put on the mask."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/07/us/george-floyd-protests-sunday/index.html", "headline": "Minneapolis City Council members intend to defund and dismantle the city's police department", "published_date": "2020-06-07", "text": "Minneapolis (CNN)Nine members of the Minneapolis City Council on Sunday announced they intend to defund and dismantle the city's police department following the police killing of George Floyd.\nThere's a growing call to defund the police. Here's what it means\n\"We committed to dismantling policing as we know it in the city of Minneapolis and to rebuild with our community a new model of public safety that actually keeps our community safe,\" Council President Lisa Bender told CNN.\nWith nine votes the city council would have a veto-proof supermajority of the council's 13 members, Bender said.\nSunday's pledge was an acknowledgment that the current system is not working, Bender said.\n\"(We need) to listen, especially to our black leaders, to our communities of color, for whom policing is not working and to really let the solutions lie in our community,\" she said.\nPressed for details on what the dismantling might look like, Bender told CNN she was looking to shift police funding toward community-based strategies and that the city council would discuss how to replace the current police department.\n\"The idea of having no police department is certainly not in the short term,\" she added.\nBender and other council members analyzed the nature of 911 calls by constituents, she said, and found most were for mental health services, health and EMT and fire services.\nThe nine council members made the announcement at a community rally in Minneapolis. News of the announcement was first reported by The Appeal.\nCalls by some to defund or outright abolish police departments have grown in the wake of Floyd's death and nationwide protests against police brutality.\nCity council members had previously said they would take steps to dismantle the police department, including Bender, who tweeted earlier this week, \"Yes. We are going to dismantle the Minneapolis Police Department and replace it with a transformative new model of public safety.\"\nMinneapolis mayor booed by protesters after refusing to defund and abolish police\nJeremiah Ellison, city councilman for Ward 5, tweeted a similar message Thursday, writing, \"We are going to dismantle the Minneapolis Police Department. And when we're done, we're not simply gonna glue it back together. We are going to dramatically rethink how we approach public safety and emergency response.\"\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey was booed by protesters Saturday night when he refused to commit to defunding and abolishing the city's police force.\nA spokesperson for the mayor said in a statement that he is \"unwavering in his commitment to working with Chief (Medaria) Arradondo toward deep structural reforms and uprooting systemic racism.\"\nNew York, Chicago and Philadelphia lift curfews\nThe city council's announcement came as protests stretched into their thirteenth day.\nOn Sunday afternoon a crowd of protesters in Washington marched from DuPont Circle to the stretch of 16th Street that now bears a massive mural declaring, \"Black Lives Matter.\" There, protesters participated in a lie-in while chanting, \"I can't breathe\" -- echoing the words of Floyd as a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck.\nProtesters in Southern California, many of them Latino, planned to caravan from Compton to the Los Angeles Police Department's headquarters. An organizer said the demonstration was meant to be inclusive and socially distant, in light of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\"Covid-19 is real,\" organizer Ron Gochez told CNN. \"We wanted people to be careful. That's why this is another way we can show our solidarity with the black community and the movement against police terrorism.\"\nThe damage and looting that overshadowed the earlier days of unrest have mostly subsided and some cities have done away with curfews, including New York.\nThe city lifted its curfew from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. \"effective immediately,\" Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Twitter Sunday morning. His announcement came after several days of largely peaceful demonstrations.\nChicago, Philadelphia, and Buffalo, New York, also lifted curfews Sunday.\nBlack Lives Matter supporters gather across globe 02:24\nSaturday's protests drew some of the largest crowds since the demonstrations began -- especially in Washington, DC. But chants of \"Black Lives Matter\" were not only heard in US this weekend, but in cities around the globe, including in France, Germany, England, Australia and Canada.\nDespite experts' concerns about coronavirus spread, the peaceful crowds decrying police brutality and demanding both justice for George Floyd and sweeping changes within the country's policing systems continue to swell in size.\nSome police departments suspend tear gas use\nAs the protests enter day 13, some cities have begun rolling out new rules for officers or plans of reform, prompted by both the demonstrations and the violent police response they've been met with, including tear gas and rubber bullets.\nPolice forces all over the US have come under fire for their use of excessive force during the protests -- the very thing demonstrators say they are speaking out against.\nMayor de Blasio said Sunday that two NYPD officers were suspended without pay due to their actions while policing protesters. One was accused of shoving a woman to the ground in Brooklyn last Friday, while the other was accused of pulling down a protester's face covering and spraying the protester with pepper spray.\nBoth officers face further disciplinary action, de Blasio said. Additionally, a supervisor in charge of the officer who pushed the woman has been reassigned.\nIn just a week, footage showed police in Buffalo, New York, push an elderly protester to the ground, causing him to bleed from the head. In Fort Lauderdale, Florida, an officer was placed on administrative leave after shoving a kneeling protester during a demonstration. And in Kansas City, Missouri, footage shows officers using pepper spray and restraining a man who was yelling about police using excessive force.\nDare we believe that this time will be different?\nOn Saturday, Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler directed the city's police chief to stop using tear gas to disperse crowds \"unless there is a serious and immediate threat to life safety, and there is no other viable alternative for dispersal.\"\n\"I stand in solidarity with our non-violent demonstrators, who are sending a strong message that we are long overdue for meaningful reform and restorative justice,\" the mayor tweeted.\nPortland is the latest US city to move away from the tactic.\nThe Seattle police chief said Friday she suspended the department's use of tear gas for crowd management for at least the next month. And in Denver, a federal judge granted a temporary restraining order prohibiting the use of \"chemical weapons or projectiles of any kind\" against peaceful protesters.\nThe order comes after four Denver residents who participated in demonstrations filed a complaint Thursday challenging the department's use of chemical agents and rubber projectiles during protests.\nPresident Donald Trump on Sunday tweeted that he had ordered the National Guard to withdraw from the nation's capital following days of peaceful protests. Around 5,000 troops were sought to patrol Washington, approximately 3,900 of which were from out of state.\nTrump did not specify whether all forces would be withdrawn or just those from out-of-state.\nHis comments came are Maj. Gen. William Walker, commander of the DC National Guard, told CNN Saturday that out-of-state troops would begin leaving as soon as Monday.\nSimilar steps were taken in Los Angeles. According to a senior law enforcement official, the city will see dramatically less of a National Guard presence on the streets.\n\"You are not going to see the National Guard on the street,\" the official said. \"But they remain here on standby and are ready to be deployed.\"\nFloyd remembered near his birthplace\nA public viewing for Floyd is set to take place in Houston on Monday. Floyd's body arrived in the city Saturday night, according to a statement from the public relations firm handling the memorial.\nA private memorial and burial will take place Tuesday. Floyd will be buried next to his mother, the statement said. Floyd he cried out for her as a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck.\nAhead of Floyd's memorial in Houston, hundreds lined up for a public viewing Saturday of Floyd's casket in Raeford, North Carolina -- about 20 miles from where he was born.\nThis Minnesota journalist says there's something important the media is missing about protests\nFloyd died last month after pleading for his life as ex-Minneapolis officer Derek Chauvin pressed his knee on the man's neck.\nChauvin is expected to make an appearance in court in Minneapolis on Monday.\nChauvin has been charged with second-degree manslaughter and third-degree murder. Prosecutors later brought the more serious charge of second-degree murder.\nThe other three officers involved in Floyd's death, J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao, were charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter.\nIn a packed memorial for Floyd on Saturday, Rev. Christopher D.

But his analytical reserve cracked after watching a video of George Floyd dying while being arrested by police.\n\"I cried,\" says Wasow, an assistant professor of politics at Princeton University. \"I'm not without deep empathy for people's anger. I feel that anger.\"\nHis emotions, though, soon turned to unease when he saw some protests over Floyd's death spiral into violence. It all seemed like a replay of the 1960s race riots, which he believes tipped the 1968 presidential election to Richard Nixon, who ran as a law-and-order candidate.\nWasow says his research shows that violent, black-led protests in the 1960s reduced white support for civil rights. And he says recent violence at the George Floyd protests could shift more white voters to Trump in November.\n\"It might be moral. It might be just,\" he says of the violence. \"But it's not strategic.\"\nA man screams with emotion as hundreds protest the death of George Floyd near the White House on May 31, 2020 in Washington.\nProtesters have captured the attention of the world over the past week. But there's a difference between getting attention and getting change. How can people translate the energy unleashed by the protests into transformative action?\nThis question and others have sparked a vigorous debate among people like Wasow and other thought leaders in the black community.\nThe debate has gone in some startling directions and challenged some long-held assumptions. Black leaders are clashing about tactics, history and even shared heroes. And lurking underneath much of these discussions is a growing sense of despair.\nSome are arguing nonviolent protest has not worked for black people\nThere can't be a racially charged protest without someone quoting the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., whose acts of nonviolent resistance drove much of the civil rights movement.\nAs some of the recent protests turned violent, King became a shadow commentator. Critics of the violence quoted King's take on a notorious racist politician of his era: \"Every time a riot develops, it helps George Wallace.\"\nA man is carried away by police during riots in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1968.\nCongressman John Lewis, the civil rights icon, released a recent statement saying he could relate to protesters' anger and despair, but that they should be \"constructive, not destructive.\"\nPresident Obama also has condemned the violence that broke out at some protests. So has Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, who said last week that demonstrators who burned cars and defaced buildings betrayed the legacy of the civil rights movement.

She wants a different legacy for her son\nTrump is doing what Obama couldn't\nBut some black intellectual leaders are offering a different -- and startling -- view of what has worked for black protesters in the past.\n\"But the fact of history is non-violent protest has not been successful for blk Americans,\" Nikole Hannah-Jones, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist with the New York Times, said in a much-debated Twitter thread.\n\"The Civil Rights Movement was not non-violent,\" she wrote, adding she believes black protesters courted violence by whites as a strategy.\nHannah-Jones on the 'collective pain' of black Americans 10:07\n\"Peaceful protest did not bring about the great civil rights legislation of the 1960s,\" she added. \"Black people being firebombed, water-hosed, lynched, bitten by dogs, beaten to a pulp by police trying to march across a bridge is what brought the changes. Violence.\"\nOthers, though, say nonviolent protests were vital to the success of the movement.\n\"How are you telling me that the Montgomery Bus Boycott -- 381 days of people walking miles to work -- that it didn't break the back of bus segregation?\" says Wasow, the Princeton political scientist.\n\"Selma, the March on Washington, the lunch counter sit-ins -- that didn't work?\" he adds. \"The civil rights movement broke Jim Crow. That is an unbelievable accomplishment and it did it primarily through nonviolent means.\"\nOne can also cite a more recent example. Former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick's kneeling protest against police brutality spread throughout sports and beyond and helped transform the debate about racism in law enforcement.\nSome argue we shouldn't apply MLK's teachings to today's black youth\nMelanye Price has a message for people invoking King and nonviolence to condemn recent protesters -- stop it.\nThey forget that 1960s activists endured arduous nonviolent training, says Price, a professor of political science at Prairie View A&M University.\nTurning the other cheek to violence is \"not instinctual,\" says Price, author of \"The Race Whisperer: Barack Obama and the Political Uses of Race.\" She says critics talk about black people as if \"nonviolence was genetically implanted in us.\"\nMartin Luther King, Jr. in Washington in 1963.\n\"People are using Martin Luther King as a weapon against them (today's protesters). If King were alive today, we don't know where he would be,\" she says. \"To use this cultural icon to be a hammer against these kids is completely unfair. Of course, these kids are not going to have good control of their emotions.\"\nNBA Hall of Famer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar agrees, saying that the current protests are the only way some marginalized Americans feel like they can be heard.\n\"They don't get the political power or the financial power to change the circumstances, so what are they going to do? The rioting is the voices of people who have no voice,\" he told CNN.\n\"I just remember seeing a sign that someone held up in Minneapolis that said, 'Can you hear us now?''' Jabbar said. \"I think that's a very poignant statement.\"\nSome wonder whether white allies are hurting the cause\nMany in the black community have long believed that blacks need white allies to help them succeed in the fight for equality. Whites have joined civil rights groups and died alongside black activists. Any movement for social and racial justice needed to appeal beyond blacks, many thought.\nSome are challenging that thinking now.\nProtesters against police brutality march through Brooklyn on June 3 in New York City.\nLaw enforcement officials have said the George Floyd protests have attracted white agitators, including armed, anti-government extremists and white supremacists who infiltrated demonstrations in Minneapolis.\nThen there's Stacey Patton, a black commentator who has wondered aloud whether the heavy white presence at the protests represents an act of solidarity or is merely \"performative.\"\n\"Are they trying to prove their wokeness and that they are not racist?\" she asked in a recent opinion column in the Washington Post. \"How are angry and traumatized black folks supposed to tell the difference between sincere white allies and those whose commitment begins and ends with the charade of performative solidarity?\"\nSome argue violent protests will help Trump get re-elected\nSome scholars believe images of black protesters choosing violence will spark a white backlash that will propel Trump to a second term. There's research to suggest these fears are not unfounded.\nWasow, the Princeton professor, published a research paper that examined the impact of media coverage of violent protests that followed King's 1968 assassination in places like Illinois, Ohio and New Jersey. He examined more than 275,000 newspaper headlines to see how media framing of the protests shaped public opinion.\nPolls showed that nonviolent protests increased white support for civil rights, while violent protests did just the opposite, he says.\nA soldier stands guard in Washington near buildings that were destroyed in the riots that followed the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. in April 1968.\nThat shift was enough to hand the White house to Nixon, who had pitched his campaign to the \"silent majority\" of Americans who were not out in the streets.\nWasow believes images of black protesters burning buildings and looting stores reinforced a preexisting narrative in American history about black people being inherently criminal.\n\"That is a story about black people that the media has been telling for hundreds of years,\" he says. \"That script is readily available to the American public, to news reporters, and it's an easy groove for the media to slip into.\"\nThat script is so ingrained in the American psyche that even peaceful protests for racial justice provoke white anxiety, other research suggests.\nAnother scholar said in a recent research paper that Trump's vocal support for police during his presidential campaign in 2016 helped gain him the support of white voters who were anxious about the social changes being proposed by Black Lives Matter protesters.\nDemonstrators raise their arms as they protest the shooting death of Michael Brown on August 17, 2014 in Ferguson, Missouri.\nWhile many Black Lives Matter protests were peaceful, others turned violent, especially after a white police officer shot and killed Michael Brown, an unarmed black man, in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014.\nNew images of black protesters looting and burning buildings could trigger anxiety among white voters who are already uneasy about the changing demographics in America, says Kevin Drakulich, the paper's lead researcher and an associate professor of criminal justice at Northeastern University in Boston.\n\"That tends to fit with their views of resisting those changes on the basis of black Americans not being deserving,\" he says. \"It's proof in their minds of their undeserving nature.\"\nSome wonder if protests will ever change anything\nThe videos of black people dying at the hands of law enforcement keep coming. And how these people were acting before they died doesn't seem to matter, says Price, the political scientist at Prairie View A&M.\n\"What we've learned from the George Floyd video is that when you're compliant, when you're not causing trouble, when you have good control of your emotions -- you still die,\" she says.\nPrice also alluded to other recent incidents, including the fatal Ahmaud Arbery shooting and the death of Breonna Taylor, a Louisville EMT who was shot while she was sleeping during a police raid of her home.\nGeorge Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor, from left.\n\"If there's violence, there's racism. If there's peaceful protests, it's there. It's there if you're sleeping in your bed. It comes to meet you wherever you are,\" Price says. \"Yes, we could try to outsmart racists, but also racists could be less racist.\"\nBut as people in the black community debate how to navigate the aftermath of George Floyd's death, they received one hopeful sign this week.\nFerguson, Missouri, where Brown's death set off weeks of protests, just elected its first black mayor.\nHer name is Ella Jones, and she got her start by running for city council during the 2014 unrest.\nThe Ferguson protests got attention.

During his term, Rizzo was praised by supporters as tough on crime but accused by critics of discriminating against minorities, according to WPVI.\n\"The statue is a deplorable monument to racism, bigotry, and police brutality for members of the Black community, the LGBTQ community, and many others,\" Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney said in an online statement. \"The treatment of these communities under Mr. Rizzo's leadership was among the worst periods in Philadelphia's history.\"\nThe statue was scheduled to be removed next year, according to WPVI.

The scorer's table was surrounded by acrylic glass dividers, for example.\nTeam benches also consisted of multiple rows of seats -- with appropriate distance between each seat -- and were divided into three sections: players; coaches and team staff.\nDuring any timeout or period break, players and coaches could still huddle like normal, but they had to sit in or congregate around movable chairs apart from the team benches. The chairs used during timeouts or period breaks were cleaned and disinfected after each use.\nThe Los Angeles Lakers and the Los Angeles Clippers took their game down to the wire on Thursday -- just like the Utah Jazz and New Orleans Pelicans did earlier in the night.\nLeBron James was clutch at the end. First, he scored what turned out to be the game-winning shot by getting the offensive rebound on his own missed shot and laying it in. On the other end of the floor, he defended the Clippers two stars, Kawhi Leonard and then Paul George, to deny the Clippers from scoring. The Lakers would win, 103-101.\nThe league shut down on March 11 when -- just moments before the Utah Jazz were to take on the Thunder in Oklahoma City -- it was learned that Jazz center Rudy Gobert had tested positive for Covid-19.\nOn Thursday night, when play resumed, it was fitting that Gobert scored the first basket in a layup and hit what would be the game-winning free throws, in Utah's 106-104 win against the Pelicans.\n\"Life works in mysterious ways,\" Gobert said. \"I'm just happy, blessed to be able to be back on the court, to do what I love to do, to be back out there with my teammates and try to win a game.\""}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/25/us/five-things-june-25-trnd/index.html", "headline": "5 things to know for June 25: Coronavirus, Joe Biden, Ahmaud Arbery, Roundup, tariffs", "published_date": "2020-06-25", "text": "Get '5 Things' in your inbox\nIf your day doesn't start until you're up to speed on the latest headlines, then let us introduce you to your new favorite morning fix.

That expert prediction comes as the US records more than 2.3 million Covid-19 cases -- and as the three most populous US states set records for new cases daily. California reported more than 7,000 cases on Tuesday, obliterating a record hit a day earlier. Florida and Texas announced they had recorded more than 5,000 new Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, and one health expert fears major Texas cities could see \"apocalyptic\" numbers.

Joe Biden\nThe presidential election is still more than four months out, but polls out of Wisconsin and Ohio bring some good news for the Democratic nominee. A Marquette University poll from Wisconsin has former Vice President Joe Biden leading President Trump, 49% to 41%. In Ohio, where Trump beat Hillary Clinton by 8 points in 2016, a Quinnipiac University poll shows a tied race. Trump's job approval has ticked down slightly, with many Americans disapproving of how he has handled recent protests over police brutality and the coronavirus pandemic.

Bryan were indicted yesterday on malice and felony murder charges, a district attorney said. The charges also include aggravated assault, false imprisonment and criminal attempt to commit false imprisonment. Arbery was jogging in February outside Brunswick, Georgia, when the McMichaels chased him, authorities said. Investigators also said they believe Bryan, who made a video recording of the shooting, used his vehicle to try to \"confine and detain\" Arbery in the minutes leading to his death. Gregory McMichael's legal team said he was a victim of a rush to judgment, and Travis McMichael's lawyer said he is not guilty.

Bayer, the German-based company that acquired agrochemical giant Monsanto in 2018, said settlements in the US would bring about 75% of current claims to a close. The move comes after years of lawsuits from cancer patients who claimed Roundup caused non-Hodgkin lymphoma and that Monsanto failed to adequately warn consumers of the risk.

Tariffs\nNow might be a good time to stock up on European chocolates, olives and beer. Those items are among 30 products that could be hit with steep tariffs as part of a longstanding US-European dispute over government subsidies to aircraft makers. The US already levied 15% to 25% tariffs on $7.5 billion worth of other European goods as part of this dispute. The new items could be hit with tariffs of as much as 100%, according to the notice. The World Trade Organization has previously sided with the US in the dispute, concluding in 2018 that the European Union helped Airbus with unfair subsidies that hurt sales of US-based Boeing's wide-body jets.

I see it all.\"\nThe death of Miller, a Black businessman and community leader who was choked to death by NYPD officers in June 1978, became a flashpoint for Brooklyn activists. His death spurred a summer of protests and the formation of \"cop watches\"\u202f-- groups of Brooklyn residents monitoring police behavior while donning their signature green jackets emblazoned with Miller's face. They now remain largely forgotten outside of Brooklyn.\nWith no cellphones to capture video or social media to amplify the incident,\u202faccounts of Miller's death exist\u202f in newspaper clippings and the memories of those who witnessed it.\nArthur Miller, businessman, community leader\nArthur Miller was born in Nassau, Bahamas, to a family who immigrated to America when he was a teenager.\nAfter arriving in Crown Heights, Brooklyn -- a neighborhood that has long served as a hub for Caribbean immigrants -- Miller thrived as an entrepreneur, his hands busy with several business and community projects. Construction became Miller's primary trade, but he also owned a grocery store on Nostrand Avenue.\nMiller -- who played the congas, trumpet and guitar to the delight of his family -- also excelled as a community leader. He led Four Block Association, a group that received a federal grant to hire local residents as a trained neighborhood watch.\n\"This was a guy who had never should have been attacked by the police,\" Bob Law, a Crown Heights activist and DJ, told the Brooklyn Historical Society.\nBy spring of 1978, Miller was planning to open up\u202f a club on Nostrand Avenue, one that would include a skating rink for children and a nightclub for adults.\nHe was to call it \"LoLisa's VIP.\"\nA fatal encounter\nOn June 14, 1978, Sam Miller, Arthur's brother, was pulled over by police on Nostrand Avenue while driving one of Arthur's trucks. Police made the stop to serve a previous violation for littering, which led to police discovering\u202f Sam had a suspended license, according to an 1983 NYPD report on cases of alleged police brutality published in a Congressional report.\nThe NYPD report says Arthur was attempting to assist Sam before Sam fled the scene chased by two officers. In the report, the NYPD claims Miller then \"became more violent in protesting his brother's arrest\" and that two officers attempted to arrest Arthur but he \"violently resisted efforts to handcuff him.\"  \nAccording to the NYPD account: \"All witnesses agreed that a violent struggle took place, but witnesses disagreed as to whether Miller was struck by nightsticks, whether the police had headlocks on Miller, and whether a nightstick was ever locked on Arthur Miller's neck.\"\nOne eyewitness told the New York Daily News (in a report republished by the Philadelphia Daily News) that \u202fArthur approached the officers with his hands raised in the air, saying \"can't we talk this over?\" According to the same eyewitness, as\u202f Miller raised his hands, officers saw a gun in his waistband -- one he was legally permitted to carry -- and charged.\n\"This white detective runs up behind Arthur and shoves him down. They handcuff Arthur's hands behind his back,\" the witness said.\u202f\"Then they got him kneeling on the sidewalk here, and one of them comes from behind and hold a nightstick across Miller's Adam's apple. The rest of the cops, they start beatin' on him.\"\nWitnesses \u202fsaid they could \u202fsee foam coming from Miller's mouth as he was shoved into a police car\u202f with his legs sticking out of the vehicle's window, according to a New York Times report. According to the NYPD report, \"Officers said Miller was conscious and struggling, but some civilian witnesses said he appeared to be unconscious.\"\nArthur Miller was pronounced dead on arrival at St. Mary's Hospital.\nWhen\u202f Arthur's wife,\u202f Florence Miller, found him\u202f at the hospital, he had multiple pairs of broken handcuffs on his wrist, according to LoLisa.\n\"He was fighting for his life,\"\u202fshe said through tears. \"Trying to make it back home to his wife and his children.\"\nA movement born\nMiller's death sent shockwaves throughout Brooklyn. Protests quickly formed under the leadership of the \"Black United Front,\" led by Reverend Herbert Daughtry, and\u202f occurred throughout the summer of 1978.\n\"We are not satisfied that police are going to stop killing our model citizens like Arthur Miller,\" Daughtry said to a crowd in downtown Manhattan while standing on a police car, according to a New York Times report.\nMeeting protestors on the street, New York Mayor Ed Koch said Miller's death was \"not a racial incident.\"\n\"If there are people who acted in an illegal way, they will be punished,\" Koch told the New York Times.\nAfter hearing testimony from 77 witnesses, a grand jury declined to recommend criminal charges against the officers. In a press release following the Grand Jury's deliberation, the Kings County District Attorney's Office described the\u202f crushing of\u202f Miller's larynx\u202f as a\u202f \"tragic unforeseeable accident which occurred during a lawful arrest,\" according to the NYPD report to Congress. It added that \"Arthur Miller was not savagely beaten by anyone.\"\nThe district attorney concluded that officers used \"uniformly recommended procedures\" when restraining Miller.\nThe NYPD report to Congress concluded: \"The United States Attorney for the Eastern District conducted an investigation and reached essentially the same conclusion as the Brooklyn District Attorney's Office. A US Justice Department investigation into this matter found no police wrongdoing.\"\nNo officers involved were ever fired or criminally charged for Miller's death.\nMiller's death and the protest movement it spurred is remembered as a formative moment for a generation of Black politicians and activists coming of age in New York.\n\"Mr. Miller's death really started a tidal wave of energy around Black activism,\" Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams told CNN. \"That event was the spark that gave way to the blaze of activism that we're experiencing now.\"\n\"Arthur Miller's death left a large imprint on our community, well before there were hashtags and social media tags to amplify the issues of the day,\" Congresswoman Yvette D. Clarke told CNN. \"His murder sparked activism in our community because none of us wanted this type of gut-wrenching grief, violence, devastation and loss to take place again.\"\nBut as the marches petered out, Miller's name faded from memory.\n\"It [the protests] went nowhere,\" Florence told the Brooklyn Historical Society in a 2017 interview. \"If there were positive results, I didn't see them.\"\n\"They destroyed my family,\" LoLisa said. \"A lot of us have never been the same.\"\nA family devastated\nIn\u202fan oral history interview with the Brooklyn Historical Society, Florence, who never remarried and passed away in 2019, recalled the long-term devastation that her husband's death had on the family.\nFlorence says that Arthur's brother, Joseph, who witnessed the death, was continuously harassed by the police after the killing. The incident turned Joseph, who was never much of a drinker before, into an alcoholic, she says.\n\"The whole incident just turned him inside out,\" Florence said.\nArthur's son, Arthur Miller 3rd, was 12 years old when his father died. At the funeral, Artie, as he is known to his family, had to be physically restrained from jumping into the grave as the casket was descending, according to LoLisa.\n\"He didn't want to live anymore,\" LoLisa said.\nLoLisa Miller-Bradford, Roz Miller-Lloyd and Vallorie Miller hold a photo of their father Arthur Miller at the cemetery where he is buried.\n\"He lost a lot of interest in things. He wanted to play basketball. He was good at it, but he didn't seem to want it anymore. That wasn't important to him anymore,\" Florence said. \"It changed their lives in a negative way. It took away their childhood. It left an empty void.\"\nToday is different\nPhotos of the protests that followed Miller's death depict a largely Black crowd, in contrast to the multi-racial protests that have sprung from the wake of George Floyd's death.\nFor some Black leaders, one explanation lies in the pervasiveness of cell phone videos, including the one that recorded Floyd's death.\n\"People can actually witness what many people in Black communities have been saying, have been screaming about, for decades,\" said Thenjiwe McHarris, a strategist at Movement for Black Lives. \"You now have millions of people that cannot deny what's happening to Black people.\"\n\"I am certain that many Black deaths would have gone unspoken, uninvestigated and ignored if it weren't for video evidence of these horrific cases,\" said Congresswoman Clarke.\nAdded Reverend Herbert Daughtry: \"The atrocities have become more pervasively shown.\"\n\"For our community, it's more enraging because this is what we've been saying forever,\" said Lumumba Akinwole Bandele, an organizer with the Movement for Black lives, who was a young child in Brooklyn when Miller died.\u202f\"Our stories are never believed.\"\nReverend Daughtry, 89, says he's in awe of young activists he sees on the streets today. \"These people are out there in the street and they're putting their lives on the line for a cause.\"\nHe says his wife has prohibited him from protesting, and she has threatened to leave him if he joins the protests.\n\"I'm 89 years old, I can't afford to get kicked out,\" said Reverend Daughtry. \"My marching ability has been seriously reduced.\"\nAt Miller's grave, in a small cemetery in Dania Beach, Florida, LoLisa stands beside her older sister, Roz Miller-Lloyd. (All three surviving sisters kept the Miller last name after they got married in honor of their father.)\n\"It doesn't get any easier,\" LoLisa said through tears. \"So many Black families have been ruined and broken by the system. They have failed us, and they continue to fail us,\" LoLisa said.\n\"There are changes coming,\" Roz said.\n\"Oh, yes, there are changes coming,\" LoLisa said in agreement.\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story incorrectly identified Arthur Miller 3rd as Arthur Miller's eldest child."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/02/us/nyc-democrats-donate-police-money-trnd/index.html", "headline": "A 19-year-old called out New York Democrats accepting police campaign donations.

So people wanted to see this.\"\nSince sharing his \"Who's Taking Cop Money?\" Google spreadsheet on Twitter on May 29, eight Democrats -- including a state senator, state assembly members and New York councilmembers -- have vowed to donate their police-funded contributions to bail funds or criminal justice reform organizations. Fernando said he requires these elected officials to send him proof of their reallocated money before updating his spreadsheet.\n\"Your contributors are a reflection of who you are,\" he said. \"I think it's fair to ask politicians to take money that aligns with the values they espouse. If you're going to fight to end solitary confinement in New York, you shouldn't be taking money from corrections officers.\"\nNew York Democratic officials respond\nAmong the most notable politicians to reallocate their campaign donations is New York State Sen. Michael Gianaris, who says he donated $16,650 in contributions to bail funds and mutual aid after Fernando's spreadsheet made the rounds.\n\"I thought this was an important thing to do,\" Gianaris said. \"Others can decide for themselves. We're held accountable by the people we represent. I'm the deputy majority leader and highest-ranking senator from New York City, so I have a special obligation to take a stand, given what happened and what we continue to see on the streets every day.\"\nGianaris said even though the decision wasn't a reflection on police officers on the whole, he's received threats from police saying they will not respond to 911 calls if he should ever need to make one.\n\"It's outrageous to suggest someone's public safety should be put in danger,\" he said. \"We're not in a political alliance with law enforcement. That mentality highlights that we have a systemic problem.\"\nCatalina Cruz, a New York state assemblywoman, said it was a mistake to take the money and that she is giving it to bail funds.\n\"Nobody questioned where I stood, but it was me proactively saying no one should question where I stood,\" she said. \"I'm not going to allow anyone to question where I stand -- not even going to give it a chance. I said, 'Let's give back the money.'\"\nOthers, such as Assemblywoman Karines Reyes, said she hadn't even realized she had taken police contributions.\n\"The contributions don't necessarily come from police officers,\" Reyes said. \"They come from an organization whose sole purpose is to protect police officers even when they're in the wrong -- oftentimes when they are in the wrong. And that is counterintuitive to accountability. There is no profession where you can kill somebody without being accountable.\"\nReyes said her constituents made clear that they didn't want their representatives taking police money anymore, which Fernando said he \"never thought\" would happen when he first made the spreadsheet.\n\"I couldn't do anything without those people on the street,\" he said. \"Without those protests, it wouldn't have had the momentum to take notice.\n\"Black Lives Matter was in the back of (politicians') minds and now it's pushed to the front,\" he said. \"That's the way I see it.\""}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/14/us/police-violence-defund-debate-trnd/index.html", "headline": "Crime is surging in US cities. Some say defunding the police will actually make it fall", "published_date": "2020-07-14", "text": "(CNN)It's been a long time since summer in the US felt this feverish.\nIt's not just the coronavirus, the social unrest and the soaring temperatures. Violent crime is surging.\nShootings and homicides, which dipped during the initial lockdown phase of the pandemic, are now rising at alarmingly high rates.\nIn New York, the homicide rate for the first half of the year is up 23% over 2019, led by a huge spike in recent violence. In Chicago, homicides jumped 39% during the last week of June and the first week of July compared to the same period last year. And Los Angeles has seen double-digit rises in homicides the past two months.\nIn Atlanta, New Orleans, Washington and other cities, the shooting victims have included children. On Sunday in Brooklyn, a 1-year-old boy was killed by gunfire in his stroller while picnicking with his family.\nAt least 6 kids killed by gun violence over holiday weekend 03:07\nOpponents of the recent movement to defund police, including President Trump, blame Black Lives Matter protesters and civil unrest for this rise in crime. And they say that what's happening now is a prime example of why cities should not cut police departments' funding. As they see it, this crime surge calls for more police and bigger law enforcement budgets.\nBut supporters of defunding police -- reducing police budgets and redirecting the money to communities in other ways, such as social services -- argue this moment is proof that the US doesn't need more police. They say if cities focused on the root causes of crime, like poverty, substance abuse and disparities in criminal justice, there wouldn't be as much need for police.\nIt's too soon to know for sure why rates of violent crime are spiking, criminologists say. But to make cities safer and earn back the public's trust, they agree that officials will need to retool police in some capacity -- and not by adding more officers.\nWhy crime is rising\nCrime is a symptom of summertime. The combination of heat, no school, outdoor hangouts and interpersonal conflict mean cities often see their highest rates of crime in the warmest months.\nBut this summer is a different beast.\nRichard Rosenfeld, a criminologist who teaches at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, said it's \"reasonably clear\" that crime is climbing at least partially due to cities reopening and activities resuming.\nRosenfeld recently published research that found the homicide rate in large US cities plunged in March, April and May compared to the previous year. He said he's almost certain that coronavirus lockdowns caused homicides to fall.\nPolice work a crime scene in Brooklyn where a 1-year-old boy was killed July 13 when gunfire erupted at a family picnic.\nHis analysis of data for June isn't complete, but he said the uptick in crime is clear. He said it's highly likely that widespread social unrest in response to George Floyd's death and other police violence is contributing to an increase in violent crime.\nRosenfeld believes the protests have stoked existing tensions between police and the communities they serve. When people don't trust police or fear their response if they call for help, they won't contact them when crimes occur or cooperate with investigators.\nThe pandemic, which has disproportionately sickened and killed Black Americans, and the Black Lives Matter protests have hit a raw nerve among people of color, said Richard Aborn, president of the Citizens' Crime Commission of New York City. This has fueled distrust of institutions, including police, and led to a \"crisis of police legitimacy,\" he said.\nAnd when people don't trust the police, Rosenfeld said, they're more likely to take matters in their own hands and settle disputes on their own.\nDefunding police would boost crime rates, some say\nSome elected officials say that employing fewer police on the streets would only give criminals a leg up.\nUS Sen. Ted Cruz has repeatedly come out against cutting police budgets, a move he says would \"decimate\" vulnerable communities. Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana said defunding police \"would be great for robbers and rapists,\" a sentiment President Trump also tweeted.\nPeople protesting the death of George Floyd and police brutality on June 2 in New York City.\nPowerful police unions like the the New York Police Benevolent Association have deflected blame for rising crime and pointed fingers instead at city officials.\nIn a letter to Mayor Bill de Blasio and other New York leaders, PBA President Patrick Lynch said city officials \"created an atmosphere of hatred and disrespect toward police officers and criminals are taking full advantage.\"\nWhen the New York Attorney General issued guidelines for an overhaul of the NYPD, Lynch called them \"reheated proposals that have been part of the anti-police agenda for decades.\" He also criticized cuts to the NYPD's budget, and in a statement implied that fewer officers on streets would cause crime to spike.\nNYPD Chief of Department Terance Monahan recently said that \"anti-police rhetoric\" has \"basically destroyed morale\" among his officers.\n\"Our cops are unsure what to do,\" Monahan told the Police Executive Research Forum last month. \"They think there's no reason to do any quality-of-life enforcement.\"\nPolice take cover as a barrage of gunfire erupts during a demonstration to mark the one-year anniversary of the shooting of Michael Brown on August 9, 2015, in Ferguson, Missouri.\nThis issue has come up before. In 2014 and 2015, the country saw protests against police brutality and racism after the killings of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Freddie Gray in Baltimore. Some police chiefs argued that their officers didn't feel comfortable responding to calls out of fear of being vilified and that crime rose as a result -- a phenomenon they called the \"Ferguson effect.\"\nBut US crime rates during those years didn't fully support that theory. There were some indicators that police drawback in Chicago and Baltimore contributed to crime hikes. But one study examined crime rates in 81 US cities in the year after Brown's death and found no overall increase.\nOthers say a lighter approach to policing will actually make crime go down\nA revamped model of policing has already paid off in some cities now considered national models for reform.\nCamden, New Jersey, which was once considered one of the most dangerous cities in the US, overhauled its police department in 2012 to emphasize partnership and problem-solving over violence and punishment. Officers now host pop-up barbecues and pull up in ice cream trucks to get to know residents. The city's crime rate has dropped by close to half.\nStaunch defenders of traditional police tactics are missing an enormous opportunity to reimagine the way law enforcement works, some criminologists say. Reform is essential to regain the public's trust, they say, which is key to curbing crime.\nLorenzo Boyd, director of the University of New Haven's Center for Advanced Policing, was a police officer for over 15 years and has trained police for the last two decades. He said policing as it exists now is not sustainable, and those who defend it support a broken system.\nAn officer in Camden County, New Jersey, grills hot dogs for one of the department's pop-up neighborhood parties. The city has reformed its police department to focus on de-escalating violence in the community.\nBoyd said these people also subscribe to a belief that isn't logical: That more police leads to less crime.\nA 2019 joint investigation from USA Today and the Marshall Project found that the number of police officers doesn't correlate with a city's crime rate. Other studies have drawn similarly inconclusive results.\nThat's because the current system of policing in most cities is reactive, not proactive, Boyd said. Officers most often respond to crime after it happens.\n\"Police as currently instituted do not affect crime rates,\" he said. \"What they do affect are investigations and arrests after the crime.\"\nInstead of \"cracking down\" on crime, police would do better to address some of crime's root causes, Boyd said. Money could be reinvested from police budgets into social programs that would bolster the communities they police.\nFor decades Eugene, Oregon, has been dispatching mental health workers and medics to some 911 calls instead of police in a partnership with a local health services nonprofit. The move has saved the town millions and reduced the likelihood that some 911 calls turn violent.\nBoyd acknowledged this approach is more of a long-term solution than an immediate fix for the country's recent rise in crime -- but he believes it's a change this moment requires.\nWhat would the US look like without police? 02:17\n\"Crime is symptomatic of larger problems in society,\" he said. \"The reason we have crime is things like homelessness, transiency, levels of addiction, underemployment, undereducation, lack of food, lack of housing -- all of those things together make crime something that people will consider. Can we really expect police to address those issues?\"\nNeither Boyd nor Aborn, who leads the Citizens' Crime Commission, believe cities should defund the police entirely. Instead, they said departments should emphasize deescalation and empathy -- skills they can build by learning from the communities they serve.\nRosenfeld, the criminologist, disagrees with those who argue the country can't reform police and respond effectively to the surge in violence at the same time.\n\"We have to do both,\" he said.\nThe health and security of the nation -- this summer and beyond -- may depend on it."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/27/us/marsha-p-johnson-statue-petition-elizabeth-new-jersey/index.html", "headline": "More than 40,000 sign to replace a Christopher Columbus statue with black trans activist Marsha P. Johnson", "published_date": "2020-06-27", "text": "(CNN)More than 43,000 people say they want a statue of Christopher Columbus in Elizabeth, New Jersey, removed. But that's not all -- they want it replaced with one of Marsha P. Johnson, a tribute they say has been a long time coming.\n\"I've always said that Marsha was more recognized in New York City and around the world than she is in her own hometown,\" her nephew, Al Michaels, says.\nJohnson, a pioneering trans-rights activist and one of the central figures in New York City's gay liberation movement from the 1960s through the 1980s, was born and raised in Elizabeth and left in her late teens with nothing but a few dollars to her name.\nShe leaves behind both a legacy of kindness and perseverance. Despite the slew of challenges she had to overcome as a Black, transgender person, those who knew her say Johnson was defined by the confidence in who she was, the compassion and care she showed others and her vibrant personality -- often translating into colorful headpieces and dashing outfits.\nLast year, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the city would commemorate both the work of Johnson and her friend and activist Sylvia Rivera with statues in Greenwich Village. Their monument will be among the first in the world to honor transgender people, the mayor's office had said.\nMichaels says it was a pleasant surprise when he saw a petition calling for the change in statues in Elizabeth. He's one of the thousands of people who have signed in about a week. He says he's even more thrilled the movement has started with such a young crowd.\nMarsha P. Johnson handing out flyers in support of gay students at New York University in 1970.\nA petition gaining traction\nThat petition was created by 19-year-old Celine Da Silva, who also grew up in Elizabeth and says she's been familiar with Johnson for years. The activist long remained part of the conversations among the city's LGBTQ community, Da Silva says, but she only recently found out Johnson was from Elizabeth.\nInspired by the reignited Black Lives Matter movement across the country in recent weeks and the tearing down of more monuments reminiscent of brutal parts of US history, Da Silva says she felt it was time the city began trekking in the same direction.\nMarsha P. Johnson\n\"There was an overwhelming amount of positive support,\" she says. \"It tells me that times are changing. People are becoming more accepting to people who identify as LGBT. It tells me that people are realizing how whitewashed our history is and how some figures that we learn about, we don't learn everything about them.\"\nEarlier this month, two other New Jersey communities moved to take down memorials to Christopher Columbus. The mayor of Camden announced the removal of a Christopher Columbus statue saying in a statement its \"presence has long pained the residents of the community.\" And in West Orange, the mayor said a Columbus monument would also be coming down, adding celebrations of Columbus' life are \"divisive and a symbol of hate and oppression and cannot remain as part of our community.\"\nBoth communities say they are working to determine what they can erect as replacements.\nDa Silva says she wants her community and other communities across the US to be celebrating more minorities and more \"people who are different from us.\"\nMarsha P. Johnson, a black transgender woman, was a central figure in the gay liberation movement\n\"And I think that the LGBT and queer community should be able to learn more about historic figures from their own community,\" she says.\nThe four young people CNN spoke with working to create change in their hometown of Elizabeth all expressed disappointment in not learning as much about figures like Johnson.\nCarter Muelle, who also helped create the petition, says schools perhaps don't know how to approach those issues. Muelle told CNN they conducted their own research after learning about Johnson.\nThey describe Johnson as a \"legend\" for the LGBTQ community.\n\"Black trans women are the most ignored and the most disrespected people, in my opinion, out of anyone,\" Muelle said. \"So I feel just her being a statue here will give hope to a lot of younger people, for sure, a lot of LGBT youth.\"\nMarsha P. Johnson surrounded by what her friend Randy Wicker says she called 'her children'\n50 strangers at the door\nIt's hardly difficult to see why the crowd behind this movement is so passionate about honoring Johnson.\nThose who knew Johnson say to know her was to love her. And for those who didn't like her, well she had her middle initial to use as her response: P -- for 'Pay it no mind.'\nMichaels says he has memories of Johnson from his childhood, when the activist would often return to her family home in Elizabeth for the holidays. She had almost always given all the clothes her parents and siblings provided her to people she would say needed them more. And she'd almost always show up to the door accompanied by a crowd.\n\"She would bring them home and there'd be 50 strangers at my grandmother's door with Marsha,\" he says. \"Sometimes they'd be there for the whole week.\n\"I'm telling you, I never knew these people and you would think they were really, really family because they stayed like family.\"\nOne of those friends: Randy Wicker, whose Hoboken, New Jersey, apartment was often Johnson's home as well.\nMarsha P. Johnson with friend Randy Wicker\nWicker, now 82, was initially hesitant of Johnson, who often worked as a prostitute and would sometimes end up in jail as a result. The two had very different approaches as well: both activists for LGBTQ rights, he would often sport a suit while Johnson opted for colorful dresses and, more often than not, bright red lipstick.\nBy the end of her lifetime the two had become like family, he says. Johnson's body was found in the Hudson River in 1992 and the circumstances of her death are still unclear. New York police ruled the death a suicide and didn't investigate. Her case was later reopened and remains undetermined.\nThe challenges she faced -- taking to the streets for an income, battling mental illness and sometimes homelessness -- meant she never criticized people who were down and instead worked to help them overcome their own battles, Wicker says.\n\"She found importance in helping others,\" he says. \"She realized that -- well, we say it but we don't really practice it -- and that is: so many things are more important than money.\"\nAnd the community caught on, today often referring to her as a saint-like figure. After she passed, Wicker says he remembers reading a tribute for Johnson, which was accompanied by her photo. Over her head was a halo.\nNot a question, but a demand\nDa Silva, who created the petition, and her boyfriend, Daniel Cano, plan on bringing up their request to the city council.\nThe effort is just one of several steps the city's young residents have taken to create a more inclusive Elizabeth.\nIn recent weeks, a new organization has begun forming -- the People's Committee of Elizabeth -- which is meant to elevate the city's Black community, the group's co-founder, 22-year-old Priscilla Gaona.\nOnline petitions work best when you do more than just sign\n\"We basically say we have to amplify the voices of the most affected and vulnerable in our city which is the Black community,\" Gaona, who backs the petition, said. \"Any figure that is rooted in colonialism or white supremacy, that degrades what our goal is.\"\nOn Saturday, the group also plans to host a Pride march, Gaona says.\nCano, who helped with the petition's creation and has been pushing for support on social media, says he hopes this move is only the first step in transforming their community.\n\"Obviously we're not asking the city council to consider putting up a statue,\" he says. \"This is a demand.\"\n\"Ultimately, a statue is going to come up no matter what. And we're going to honor Marsha in the way that she deserves to be honored.\""}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/11/us/five-things-june-11-trnd/index.html", "headline": "5 things to know for June 11: Coronavirus, BLM, immigration, election, Nigeria", "published_date": "2020-06-11", "text": "Get '5 Things' in your inbox\nIf your day doesn't start until you're up to speed on the latest headlines, then let us introduce you to your new favorite morning fix.

Coronavirus\nThere are now more than 2 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the US, and health experts have issued a new and bleak prediction: Following widespread reopenings, another 100,000 people in the US will die of the disease by September, pushing the death toll to well above 200,000. While infection numbers and hospitalizations are going up in some states, health officials in Missouri are looking into an unusual case. Two hairstylists there who worked while they had coronavirus symptoms did not infect the 140 clients they served in mid-May. County health officials called the result encouraging and said they're looking into the case for insight on how to stop the virus' spread.\nGov. Cuomo: We've been through hell.

Black Lives Matter\nNASCAR has banned Confederate flags from all its races and events after African American driver Bubba Wallace called on the racing body to crack down on fans using the symbol. It's the latest move by a major brand amid protests for racial justice. US Soccer also repealed a policy requiring players to stand during the National Anthem, and some US military leaders are considering renaming bases that honor Confederate commanders. Around the country, statues of Christopher Columbus and other problematic historical figures are coming down. On the legislative side, the Trump administration is reportedly mulling an executive order on police reform, though it's unclear what it may contain. And in a case many activists say has gone under the radar during recent protests, the detective who applied for the warrant that ended in the March shooting death of Breonna Taylor has been placed on administrative reassignment.\nNASCAR driver to race with Black Lives Matter themed car 01:18\n3. Immigration\nA new Trump administration proposal would make it harder for migrants to claim asylum in the US. An asylum claim could face greater scrutiny if the person traveled through at least one country on the way to the US but didn't seek refuge there. It would also punish people who lived unlawfully in the US for a long time before applying for asylum. Though the latest rules don't mention the coronavirus, the past few months have seen more than a dozen changes to the immigration system tied to the pandemic: Immigration hearings have been postponed, refugee admissions have been put on pause and migrants have largely been barred from entering the US. In fact, the American Civil Liberties Union just filed a lawsuit against some of these stringent border restrictions.\nLawyer defending Trump policy makes stunning admission (March) 04:49\n4. Election 2020\nAfter Georgia's disastrous primary, election officials across the US are getting more concerned about the fall presidential contest. Besides long lines and technical problems, polling places in some counties changed at the last minute as some sites pulled out due to coronavirus concerns. Georgia voters also had trouble with mail-in ballots that had confusing instructions. All in all, the state was overwhelmed with nearly 1.6 million absentee ballot applications and struggled to process them all. This may be a worrying sign that other states new to mail-in voting could face similar challenges as they ramp up for November.\nPelosi claims Georgia voting issues could be 'by design' 04:29\n5.

Residents said men attacked the village in armored tanks and trucks filled with guns, the government reported. The Nigerian military is sending more troops to the area, and local officials want the military's help in ending the terrorist group's long-running campaign of indiscriminate violence in the region.

When video of the incident surfaced, it sparked protests across the globe with people taking to the streets to demand justice for Floyd and an end to police brutality.\nAt one point during the June 4 protest, Schatzel handed her phone to a friend, walked to the crosswalk and held up her \"Black Lives Matter\" sign waiting for her friend to snap a picture.\nThe moment was also caught by another camera, however -- and video of Schatzel posing amid a demonstration quickly went viral and sparked backlash. After being posted on @influencersinthewild, a Twitter account dedicated to showing the lengths social media influencers will go to for content, it garnered more than 19 million views.\nAs protests continue, Schatzel and a handful of other social media influencers have found themselves being accused of using the unrest sweeping the country as a chance to create content.\nOther instances have also gone viral, including one where a woman, wearing a mask and floppy hat, is seen posing in front of a boarded-up building in the aftermath of looting that occurred during some protests.

Some have described the actions of these select creators as \"shameless.\"\n\"People feel that it's okay to use protest and other tragic situations as political theater as props because they don't have a sense of consequences or propriety. It's shameless,\" Roberto Blake, an influencer, entrepreneur and educator, told CNN over Twitter.\n\"Whether it's an Instagram model in the streets or our leaders abusing sacred symbols, it's distasteful and entitled. If they put that time into planning a shoot instead into becoming educated about the issues, they wouldn't even contemplate it.\"\n'A lot of people do this kind of stuff'\nMike Metzler, a digital marketing manager, characterized the type of behavior exhibited by Schatzel and others as \"influencer opportunism.\"\n\"When you're an influencer and 'making content' is your job, you can begin to view every experience and part of your life as a 'possible' piece of content,\" Metzler told CNN over Twitter. \"This becomes a habit and a way of life for many influencers. But the truth is, not everything needs to be content, and there are certain situations where you really need to pause and read the room.\"\nTaylor Lorenz, a New York Times reporter who covers internet culture, said this type of opportunism isn't new.\nLast year, she wrote an article for The Atlantic about the backlash some influencers received after visiting Pripyat, Ukraine, the city left in ruin after the nuclear disaster at the Chernobyl power plant in 1986. The location spiked in popularity last summer due to the hit HBO miniseries \"Chernobyl.\"\nIn a way, what influencers did at Chernobyl is similar to what they've been seen doing around the US over the past few weeks, Lorenz told CNN.\n\"Influencer culture is so pervasive now,\" Lorenz said in a phone interview. \"Everyone is trying to capture their experiences and communicate their feelings about this very fraught subject and racism in general.\"\n\"This woman obviously missed the mark but a lot of people do this kind of stuff,\" Lorenz said, referring to Schatzel.\nA notable example of another influencer turning the demonstrations into an excuse to promote themselves involved one of YouTube's biggest stars.\nEarlier this month, Jake Paul was charged with criminal trespass and unlawful assembly after video showed him at a Scottsdale, Arizona, mall as it was being looted, police said.\nThe 23-year-old, who has 20.1 million followers on YouTube, was present during the looting and property destruction that happened at the city's Fashion Square mall on May 30, the Scottsdale Police Department said in a Facebook post.\nVideo taken by his photographer and posted by another user to Twitter appeared to show Paul outside the mall as people were attempting to break in.\n'People go to protests to be heard': Reflections on the '60s and today\nLater, the footage appears to show him inside the mall along with others after it had closed. It is unclear whether Paul took anything, and he has not been charged with any theft or vandalism that occurred.\nPaul, whose older brother Logan Paul is also a famous YouTube creator, said that he nor anyone else he was with was engaged in looting or vandalism, and that his group was tear gassed by police.\nThis isn't the first time Paul has faced controversy. He was booted from Disney Channel in 2017, and has since utilized his online popularity -- most notably from the former short-form video platform Vine -- to keep eyeballs on his content. He's been called out for his bad behavior many times, but continues to remain popular.\nSome, like Blake, hope Paul's most recent public controversy will become a \"teachable moment.\"\n\"My thought and hope is that this is a teachable moment for him as well as his audience and also his peers and that the right lessons are learned from it,\" Blake said, adding he doesn't know Paul personally. \"But I have no interest in condemning him or canceling, and even I did it would just be a distraction for the more important and more relevant issues that need to be addressed.\"\nHow to leave 'influencer opportunism' behind\nEven after the apology, Schatzel told CNN she feels she has ruined her reputation and career \"because of a picture.\"\n\"The backlash has been defamatory toward me as a woman and a human being; they (are) calling out for my public rape, murder threats, public lynching over a picture,\" she said. \"I can't wrap my head around this kind of backlash.\"\nBut some in the creator community are giving her the benefit of the doubt.\nGabrielle Epstein, an influencer with 2.3 million followers on Instagram, said she felt uncomfortable by Schatzel's post but understood Schatzel likely \"had good intentions.\"\n\"I think the spotlight needs to be about the movement as a whole rather than the individual,\" Epstein told CNN. \"We are all human, we all make mistakes, and in the era of social media have become frighteningly quick to judge and criticize others.

Jones attended Southern Baptist churches, Sunday schools, even a Southern Baptist college.\nBut it was only in seminary, in his mid-20s, that Jones says he learned the full truth about Southern Baptists' white supremacist roots. The denomination was founded to defend slavery and did not formally rebuke its past until 1995, when Southern Baptists voted to apologize for their history of racism.\nJones was a social scientist before he realized how stubbornly racist ideas can persist in White churches.\n\"White Christian churches have not just been complacent; they have not only been complicit,\" he writes in his book, \"White Too Long: The Legacy of White Supremacy in American Christianity,\" publishing next month.\n\"Rather, as the dominant cultural power in America, they have been responsible for constructing and sustaining a project to protect White supremacy and resist Black equality,\" he writes. \"This project has framed the entire American story.\"\nRobert P. Jones\nIn the book Jones, CEO and founder of Public Religion Research Institute, blends church history, memoir and contemporary public opinion surveys. Together, they make a clear and compelling case for why White American Christians need to reckon with their past.\nBut American Christianity's past is only part of the problem.\nIn survey after survey, said Jones, contemporary white Christians repeatedly deny that structural racism is a problem, that shootings of unarmed Blacks are not isolated incidents, or even that African Americans still face racism and discrimination.\nWhite non-Christians, on the other hand, more often agree with Blacks about racial discrimination, according to public opinion surveys.\nSo what gives? Why would White Christians be more reluctant to see racism than their non-Christian counterparts?\nIf that's the question that animates \"White Too Long,\" the answer will be challenging, if not deeply unsettling for many White Christians.\nCNN spoke to Jones recently about why so many White Christians turn a blind eye to racism, how white supremacy took hold of American culture and what Christians can do now to make amends.\nWhat prompted you to write this book?\nWhenever we asked questions about race or African Americans there was a huge gap between Whites who are Christian and those who are not. Whites who are not Christian were always closer to the attitudes of African Americans.\nSeeing that pattern over and over made me realize that something deeper is going on. And coupled with my own experience of growing up in the South and this current moment, I realized that these issues are not being dealt with well. Most White Christians try to ignore them.\nTo that point, it seems like more White evangelicals than we've seen in the past are speaking out against the recent killings of Black Americans by the police and vigilantes. Joel Osteen, who is often studiously apolitical, marched in a Black Lives Matter protest. Some evangelicals are even mentioning systemic racism, which they've been slow to acknowledge in the past. What do you make of their responses?\nOne measure of authenticity for White Christians is whether they link reconciliation with justice and repair. It's easy for a White Christain leader to jump in a march and put his arm around an African-American pastor. But will we see Joel Osteen preach a sermon calling for White Christians to reflect on the ugly parts of our history? Are pastors going to help White Christians free their faith from privileged claims of whiteness?\nOne of the challenges, historically, has been that the Christian theology developed in White churches intentionally blinds White Christians to racial injustice. White Christians are nearly twice as likely as non-religious Americans to say police shootings of unarmed black men are isolated incidents. That is a moral and theological problem.\nPastor Joel Osteen attends a march in honor of George Floyd on June 2, 2020 in Houston, Texas.\nWe've heard some Christian leaders denounce racism in clear moral terms, but that doesn't seem to filter down to the pews, according to surveys. And that's a problem not only for White evangelicals but Catholics and others, right?\nYes, that's true not only for evangelicals but Catholics and the more liberal mainline Protestant leaders. They've put out a number of statements and press releases, but historically they have not landed at the parish or congregational level. And that's where theology gets built: at the local level.\nThe hymns sung, the scripture passages preached, how people understand salvation, none of that has been deconstructed. It was all built for a world in which White Christians needed to shield their institutions and beliefs from claims of injustice by African Americans.\nYou can see that in the way Black Catholics were forced to sit in the back of the church and receive Communion last, and in the way the Southern and Northern branches of Methodism realigned after the Civil War but still didn't admit Black churches as equal members.\nWhy have so many White Christians been so slow to recognize the racism in their past, as well as the racism that continues in America?\nAs long as White supremacy has a hold on our culture, it's pretty comfortable for White Christian churches to say their theology is about personal salvation and personal lives. Theology has been constricted to be only about personal piety, disconnected from claims of social justice. Everything outside of salvation has been labeled \"politics.\"\nIt's a self-protective move. If you read sermons in Mississippi in the 1950s and 1960s you would have no idea that there was a Civil Rights movement. It was a lulling of white consciences to sleep.\nWorshipers leaving an American church in the 1950s. \"If you read sermons in Mississippi in the 1950s and 1960s you would have no idea that there was a civil rights movement,\" Jones says.\nBut what about now, this moment?\nI see the last four years as a moment of reckoning for White Christians. The election of President Trump, who has put White supremacy front and center, has brought these issues from just barely below the surface into plain view. Charlottesville changed things. Charleston changed things. Dylan Roof was a confirmed Lutheran, who, in his journal while imprisoned has been drawing crosses and white Jesus and is completely unrepentant.\nWhite Christians have inherited a worldview that has Christians on top of other religions, men over women, Whites over Blacks. There is a top-down authoritarian structure to it.\nWhat, if anything, can change that?\nIn the book, I write about two Baptist churches in Macon, Georgia, one White and one Black, who have built trust and a partnership in a way that allowed White Christians to be challenged about their assumptions. White Christians don't have the critical distance to do that for themselves. They have to put themselves in community with African American Christians. And frankly, even with that, it's going to be a long journey."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/09/us/disband-police-camden-new-jersey-trnd/index.html", "headline": "This city disbanded its police department 7 years ago. Here's what happened next", "published_date": "2020-06-09", "text": "(CNN)Last week, Minneapolis officials confirmed they were considering a fairly rare course of action: disbanding the city police department.\nIt's not the first locale to break up a department, but no cities as populous have ever attempted it. Minneapolis City Council members haven't specified what or who will replace it if the department disbands.\nCamden, New Jersey, may be the closest thing to a case study they can get.\nMinneapolis City Council members intend to defund and dismantle the city's police department\nThe city, home to a population about 17% of Minneapolis' size, dissolved its police department in 2012 and replaced it with an entirely new one after corruption rendered the existing agency unfixable.\nBefore its police reforms, Camden was routinely named one of the most violent cities in the US.\nNow, seven years after the old department was booted (though around 100 officers were rehired), the city's crime has dropped by close to half. Officers host outdoor parties for residents and knock on doors to introduce themselves. It's a radically different Camden than it was even a decade ago. Here's how they did it.\nWhy departments dissolve police\nA city's decision to dissolve its police department is often a matter of money -- and the cities that chose to do so are often quite small. Camden comes closest to Minneapolis in its size and history of misconduct.\nEarlier this year, the village of Deposit, New York, dissolved its department because it cost $200,000 per year. Now, a single sheriff's deputy is assigned to the village, CNN affiliate WICZ reported. Garden City, Missouri, laid off all of its officers and suspended its police chief because, as its mayor said in 2018, the city couldn't afford to keep them employed.\nIn a bizarre move, Rio Vista police leadership abruptly left the department, and half of the remaining officers left for other jobs, so the California city's department could no longer go on, CNN affiliate KCRA reported in January.\nLt. Zack James of the Camden County Metro Police Department marches along with demonstrators in Camden.\nCamden dissolved its police department to root out corruption.\nThe city's crime rate was among the worst in the US. Within nine square miles and among nearly 75,000 residents, there were over 170 open-air drug markets reported in 2013, county officials told CNN. Violent crime abounded. Police corruption was at the core.\nLawsuits filed against the department uncovered that officers routinely planted evidence on suspects, fabricated reports and committed perjury. After the corruption was exposed, courts overturned the convictions of 88 people, the ACLU reported in 2013.\nSo in 2012, officials voted to completely disband the department -- it was beyond reform.\nAnd in 2013, the Camden County Police Department officially began its tenure. No other city of Camden's size has done anything quite like it.\nHow the new Camden police changed its approach\nCity officials had two objectives in remaking Camden's police: reduce crippling violent crime and make residents feel safer.\nLouis Cappelli, Camden County freeholder director (another term for a county-level public official), said the department still has a ways to go, but its efforts over the last seven years have been largely successful.\n\"Back then residents of Camden city absolutely feared the police department and members of the department,\" he told CNN. \"They (the residents) wanted that to change.\"\nViolent crimes have dropped 42% in seven years, according to city crime data provided by the department. The crime rate has dropped from 79 per 1,000 to 44 per 1,000, the data shows.\nA Camden County officer grills hot dogs for one of the department's pop-up neighborhood parties.\nCappelli credits the improvement to new \"community-oriented policing,\" which prizes partnership and problem-solving over violence and punishment.\nIt starts from an officer's first day: When a new recruit joins the force, they're required to knock on the doors of homes in the neighborhood they're assigned to patrol, he said. They introduce themselves and ask neighbors what needs improving.\nTraining emphasizes deescalation, he said, and the department's use of force policy makes clear that deadly force is the last option.\nNow, police host pop-up barbecues and pull up in Mister Softee trucks to get to know residents, Cappelli said. They host drive-in movie nights -- recently, the movie of choice was \"The Lion King\" -- along what used to be known as the city's \"Heroin Highway.\"\nThe community-first initiative has made improving diversity within the force a priority, too. Whites are the minority in Camden, so Cappelli said the new department has hired more black and brown officers to serve black and brown residents. (Cappelli didn't have exact numbers for the increase, but said it's improved.)\nCappelli said the new department also hired over 100 officers who previously served the dissolved Camden Police Department. They joined the department, which now employs over 400.\n\"We want to make sure residents of the city know these streets are theirs,\" he said. \"They need to claim these streets as their own, not let drug dealers and criminals claim them.\"\nWhat Minneapolis can learn from criticism of Camden\nCamden and Minneapolis aren't perfect mirrors. The Midwestern metropolis is predominantly white -- 63% of the population -- and less than 19% black. In Camden, less than a quarter of all residents are white, but 42% of the population is black and over 50% is Latino.\nCamden also has about 356,000 fewer residents.\nThe criticisms lodged at Camden, though, may inform how Minneapolis goes about its restructuring.\nCamden County police pose with residents outside a Mister Softee ice cream truck.\nOjii BaBa Madi, a lifelong resident of Camden and Justice Minister at Asbury Community Church, said he's felt no improvement in his relationship with police because many of the new officers don't live in Camden or know the community well.\nAdditionally, the department's racial makeup isn't entirely reflective of the city it serves, he told CNN in an email.\n\"The demographics of the city do not reflect these demographics,\" he said. \"With a white chief, as thoughtful and progressive as he is, and only one African American captain out of seven, both the dynamics and optics of race are a problem.\"\nWhat has improved, he said, is officers' willingness to have a \"productive dialogue\" between police and community leaders like him. And the city \"does feel much safer at the neighborhood level\" since police started shuttering open-air drug markets.\nAs for abolishing police entirely, Ojii said the city is \"far away from any practical de-policed reality\" partly because of the crime that still exists there.\n\"I would prefer to nail some best practices for policing as it should be,\" he said, as the city -- and society -- figures out how to change law enforcement as it exists now.\nA Camden County officer plays basketball with a young resident.\nNyeema Watson, also a lifelong Camden resident who's the associate chancellor for civic engagement at Rutgers University -- Camden, said she thinks the restructuring has had a largely positive impact. Officers are more visible now, and they're building trust and welcoming feedback.\nCamden County Police Chief Joseph Wysocki marched with Camden residents in a \"Black Lives Matter\" protest in May. Hearing him acknowledge the \"rightful pain, anger and frustration\" black residents feel about police brutality was powerful, Watson said.\nWatson and Ojii agreed the city's problems remain unsolved. Those require more work than a shift in law enforcement alone can provide.\n\"We can't police our way out of social issues, unemployment, disproportionate health issues, economic challenges -- these are things that drive crime,\" Watson said.\nWhen the city improves access to education for its residents, they'll better understand systemic racism within law enforcement and how to dismantle it, she said.\n\"There are so many issues in our city, outside of policing, that promote a constant level of tension,\" Ojii said, naming gentrification, poverty and addiction among them. \"In essence, Camden remains a tale of two cities.\""}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/08/us/lapd-protesters-black-lives-matter/index.html", "headline": "Following backlash, LA officials say they won't criminally charge or fine peaceful protesters", "published_date": "2020-06-08", "text": "Los Angeles (CNN)After facing backlash over how Los Angeles Police Department officials treated protesters during the first week of demonstrations following George Floyd's death, city officials on Monday said they will not prosecute those arrested for curfew violations and failure to disperse.\n\"Our Office will be creating opportunities for violators to participate in an exchange of ideas and perspectives -- as well as a discussion of tangible steps that can be taken by individuals, communities, law enforcement and our office -- to address issues relevant to these protests,\" City Attorney Mike Feuer's office said in a news release.\nThe Los Angeles Times first reported the news Sunday.\nThe news comes after tension between Angelenos and police officials escalated amid protests for Floyd, a 46-year-old black man who died at the hands of Minneapolis police. Video of his death sparked protests nationwide, including in areas across LA, with demonstrators demanding justice for Floyd and an end to police brutality.\nWhile last week's demonstrations were largely peaceful, some organizations and city leaders have flagged concerning reports about previous protests being disrupted by police.\nLA Councilman Mike Bonin sent a letter to Los Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore on Saturday expressing his concern over various allegations of police brutality reported last weekend by the LA Times and his constituents.\n\"I am alarmed by the growing number of disturbing accounts and images of peaceful protesters being assaulted with plastic bullets, tasers, batons, physical force, and of reports that protestors were detained unnecessarily by law enforcement during last weekend's George Floyd solidarity protests,\" Bonin wrote in the letter, a copy of which was provided to CNN by his spokesman.\n\"I have spent several hours reading accounts and watching videos of the experiences of demonstrators,\" he wrote. \"Not just the accounts of longtime activists, but of newly engaged Angelenos who took to the streets. Not in other cities, but right here in our own Los Angeles.\"\nBonin called on Moore to investigate \"not just individual instances, but of underlying policies and of strategic decisions by the Los Angeles Police Department and other law enforcement agencies.\"\nWhen asked by CNN for comment regarding Bonin's letter on Sunday, a spokesman for the LAPD said, \"We don't have a statement we're putting out on that.\"\nBonin's letter came one day after the Los Angeles chapter of Black Lives Matter and the Los Angeles Community Action Network filed a lawsuit against the city over how LA police have handled protests.\n\"Over the course of approximately a week, the Los Angeles Police Department arrested more than 2,600 individuals engaged in peaceful protest,\" according to the suit obtained by CNN. \"This was not the first time that the LAPD has engaged in these tactics. Over the course of the last several decades, the Defendant City has been sued repeatedly for many of the same tactics on display the past week, including kettling protestors before declaring an unlawful assembly, excessive force with batons and rubber bullets, and prolonged handcuffing and improper conditions of confinement for arrestees.\"\nLAPD Public Information Director Josh Rubenstein told CNN in an email statement Monday that \"the Los Angeles Police Department is not able to comment on pending litigation.\"\n\"However, regarding any mistreatment, violations of Department policy, or excessive use of force; we are reviewing numerous videos, and personal accounts of what happened,\" he said. \"We will investigate thoroughly every allegation, as the treatment of protestors speaks to the heart of the very subject of these demonstrations.\"\nThe Los Angeles City Attorney's office has no comment regarding the suit, spokesman Rob Wilcox told CNN.\nVideos of some encounters between demonstrators and LAPD officials have surfaced online and circulated widely on various social media platforms. Saturday, the LAPD issued a statement to CNN about these viral videos.\n\"Protests, marches and demonstrations over the last several days have been often dynamic and at times dangerous situations for both officers and demonstrators,\" LAPD said in its email. \"A number of these gatherings have unfortunately devolved into chaos with rocks, bottles, and other projectiles being launched at police officers, who have sustained injuries that range from cuts and bruises to a fractured skull.\"\nThe statement goes on to note that the LAPD is \"aware of individuals who have posted videos online and on social media depicting encounters with the police, that they believe constitutes excessive force or misconduct during these demonstrations.\" They said they will \"investigate each instance thoroughly, and hold any officer who violates department policy accountable.\"\nThe LA City Attorney's Office said it will develop new programs focused on the relationship between the community and law enforcement and plans to implement them later this summer.\nIn the city attorney office's news release, Moore issued a statement backing \"this approach to criminal justice reform,\" adding that he will \"work closely with the City Attorney's Office to ensure it is successful.\"\n\"Resolving these violations through alternative methods is a productive and appropriate way to address these offenses, and will have lasting positive effects on our community,\" Moore said in the statement.\nArrests amid peaceful protests\nLAPD officers arrive to arrest protesters for curfew violation after a day of peaceful protest against police brutality. The protests were sparked by the death of George Floyd.\nLos Angeles was among the 40 cities nationwide that imposed a curfew after looting occurred during demonstrations the weekend of May 30.\nIn Santa Monica on May 31, a protest became violent, with police firing rubber bullets and other objects at protesters in an effort to get them to disperse.\nProtesters also threw objects, including slabs of concrete, at police. Stores were also looted.\nElsewhere in LA, rubber bullets were also used, some demonstrators said. \"Insecure\" actor Kendrick Sampson took to social media to share that he was shot seven times with rubber bullets by police during a protest May 30.\n\"He pointed the gun DIRECTLY AT ME,\" Sampson wrote on Twitter, linking to a news report about his experience. \"I actually got hit 7 times with rubber bullets and many with batons. My boy has stitches.\"\nThe Los Angeles Police Department did not respond to CNN's previous request for comment regarding Sampson's social media posts.\nLast week, graphic photos that circulated online showed a man in a wheelchair with a bloodied face, an incident Bonin cited in both his letter and tweets. The man in the image is also referenced in the lawsuit over the city's handling of the protests, where he is identified as Cincinatti.\n\"Cincinatti is disabled and in a wheelchair,\" the suit states. \"He pleaded with police not to use force on him before being shot in the face. But he was not the only disabled person in a wheelchair to be struck in the face by a rubber bullet as the LAPD enforced curfew laws and other misdemeanors in the last week.\"\nIn the lawsuit filed Friday, one demonstrator alleged that he was detained and handcuffed tightly behind his back for about four hours, experiencing numbness, bruising and soreness.\nThe lawsuit also alleges that some unhoused people \"had no place they could go to avoid violating the curfew,\" yet they were \"subjected to excessive force,\" arrested, \"tightly handcuffed\" and taken on buses to Jackie Robinson Stadium on the Veterans Affairs property in West Los Angeles.\nWhen asked about the photo of the man in the wheelchair and allegations of excessive force for those detained, a spokesperson for the LAPD told CNN over the phone: \"We're not making statements on any of those to the fact that they're investigations now and we cannot comment on them.\"\n'We want peace'\nDuring a news conference last Monday, Moore said those protesting by committing criminal acts were not mourning Floyd.\n\"We didn't have people mourning the death of this man, George Floyd -- we had people capitalizing,\" the police chief said June 1. \"His death is on their hands as much as it is those officers.\"\nMoore apologized on Twitter, but many had already expressed their outrage over his comments in replies to the video which was posted on Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti's Twitter page.\n\"I misspoke when making a statement about those engaging in violent acts following the murder of George Floyd,\" he wrote.\nSome demonstrators last week said they wanted \"peace\" with police.\n\"We want peace,\" Joseph Haynes told CNN on June 2. \"We're trying to tell the police, all over the country, if you just march with us you're showing that you're not standing in solidarity for a system that has oppressed people for hundreds of years.\"\nAn LAPD officer chases a suspected looter in an alley behind Hollywood Boulevard on June 1.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) branch in Southern California filed a lawsuit last week on behalf of the Black Lives Matter organization over the curfews in Los Angeles city and county, as well as San Bernardino.\n\"The curfews' extraordinary suppression of all political protest in the evening hours plainly violates the First Amendment to the US Constitution, and their blanket restrictions on movement outside working hours violate the Constitution's protection of freedom of movement,\" the ACLU said in a news release issued June 3.\nGarcetti, Moore and Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva are among the defendants listed in that suit.\nLA County and the city of LA had separate curfews. Both LA County and the Los Angeles mayor lifted the curfew last Thursday. A sheriff's spokesperson told CNN affiliate CBSLA that the decision to lift curfew was not linked to the ACLU lawsuit.\nMayor and police chief garner backlash\nLos Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti has agreed to slash between $100 million and $150 million from the proposed funding for the LAPD.\nAs people continue to voice their concerns over the police department's treatment of protesters, Garcetti has also become the center of backlash.\nGarcetti is the son of former Los Angeles District Attorney Gil Garcetti, who was elected in the aftermath of riots sparked by the 1992 acquittal of four officers charged in the 1991 Rodney King beating. The Rev. Al Sharpton said in 2012 that King's beating \"made America focus on the presence of profiling and police misconduct.\"\nNow the younger Garcetti is a leader amid a similarly tense time for the city.\nIn an interview with CNN's Ana Cabrera on May 30, Garcetti said there are \"absolutely\" lessons to be learned from his father's experiences during that time.\n\"What we learned from that is that we have to actually start to listen to each other,\" he said. \"Law enforcement has to hear the pain of African American men and communities of color ... but secondly, we have to humanize who those people behind the badge are, too.\"\nLast Tuesday, on June 2, protesters gathered outside Garcetti's home.\nA small group of protesters remained there hours after curfew, sitting on the ground with their hands up together, chanting \"peaceful protest,\" CNN reported. Police moved in to arrest some of those still gathered.\nMany Angelenos frustrated by the police department, specifically Moore, dialed in to a Zoom conference hosted by the Los Angeles Police Commission on June 2, the same day protesters rallied outside of Garcetti's home.\n\"Listen to the people of Los Angeles, they're not going to take it anymore,\" one caller said to Moore. \"You are all guilty if you don't figure this out. ... Send the National Guard home. We don't need protection, we need protection from you.\"\n\"Chief Moore is morally obligated to resign,\" another caller said. \"All your cute Zoom background photos of the city won't trick us into thinking you care about anyone but yourselves and what's in your pockets.\"\n\"Black lives matter, act like it. Happy Tuesday,\" the same caller said in his remarks, a clip of which has garnered more than 170,000 retweets on Twitter.\nThe meeting lasted about seven hours.\nAngelenos continue to protest\nProtesters march past LAPD officers in downtown Los Angeles on Saturday during a demonstration over the death of George Floyd while in Minneapolis police custody.\nSunday marked nearly two weeks of protests across the US, including in multiple areas of Los Angeles. About 20,000 people showed up to one demonstration in Hollywood, according to CNN affiliate KTLA.\nSome protesters in LA said the mood felt more peaceful this weekend.\nNaomi Trantu, a Los Angeles resident, told CNN on Friday that she has seen less of a police presence since the protests began.\nIn earlier days, \"the police were agitated,\" she said. \"Every day, there's been fewer police. I think the more peaceful energy is because of that. There's been no shift in intention. Empowerment was always there.\"\nGarcetti on Sunday afternoon announced the California National Guard units will leave the city \"this evening.\"\nThere's a growing call to defund the police. Here's what it means\nHe wrote in a tweet: \"I'm proud L.A. residents are leading a peaceful and powerful movement to build a fair, just, and equitable city.\"\nGarcetti also agreed Wednesday to slash between $100 million and $150 million from the proposed funding for the LAPD after Californians decried a proposal to increase its budget to $1.86 billion.\nThe People's Budget LA Coalition called Garcetti's pledge \"a start,\" noting that cutting $150 million from LAPD would \"still leave LAPD with 51% of the city's unrestricted revenues.\"\n\"We're encouraged to see that our constant action has pushed Mayor Garcetti and City Council to back up their nice words with some actual action, however small, that directly confronts the racist police state that is the City of Los Angeles,\" said Melina Abdullah, one of the leaders of Black Lives Matter Los Angeles, in a statement.\n\"But they need to go much further.\"\nCNN's Kyung Lah, Alexandra Meeks, Sarah Moon, Cheri Mossburg, Joe Sutton, Scottie Andrew and Jason Kravarik contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/26/us/miami-gardens-officer-charged/index.html", "headline": "An ex-officer is charged with battery and official misconduct after video shows him Tasing a woman with his knee on her neck", "published_date": "2020-06-26", "text": "(CNN)A former police officer in Miami Gardens, Florida, has been charged with battery and official misconduct after video surfaced of him Tasing a woman while his knee was on her neck.\nJordy Yanes Martel, 30, of Hialeah, was arrested Thursday on four counts of battery and two counts of official misconduct by Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) agents, an agency news release states.

There are countless songs about it. Streets still carry the name, as do restaurants and grocery stores.\nBut Dixie has also been a problematic label, carrying with it the ugly remnants of slavery and the exploitation of Black people.\nAs America once again reckons with racial injustice, it's also reexamining this weighty word.\nThis week the country trio the Dixie Chicks said it has changed its name to The Chicks. Dixie Brewery, the oldest brewery in New Orleans, is changing its name to a new brand that \"best represents [their] culture and community.\"\nAnd earlier this year, Miami-Dade County commissioners in Florida voted to rename portions of The Dixie Highway -- it runs 5,786 miles through 10 states from Michigan to Miami -- to Harriet Tubman Highway.\nDixie may have come to define an aspect of life in the South, but exactly how it achieved that is up for debate.\nSo how did the word Dixie originate?\nSeveral theories on where it came from\nHistorians disagree about its origins. Some believe Dixie derives from the Mason-Dixon line, between Maryland and Pennsylvania.\nThe line was drawn in 1767 to resolve a border dispute between the colonies but later became the informal border separating the South and North.\nWhy the noose is such a potent symbol of hate\n\"The other story is a 19th century story about the $10 notes in Louisiana. On the back side it said 'dix,' which means 10 in French,\" said Tammy Ingram, author of \"Dixie Highway: Road Building and the Making of the Modern South, 1900-1930\".\nBefore the Civil War, Citizens' Bank of New Orleans issued the notes, which became known as \"Dixies.\"\nSome historians believed the term was adopted to describe Louisiana and then later became the geographical nickname for the South.\n\"We don't actually quite know when the term started or where it was derived from. But by the mid-19th century it was a minstrel song,\" Ingram said. \"By that point it was clearly in popular culture associated with the South and recognized as a racialized term.\"\nIngram is referring to \"Dixie,\" a minstrel song composed by Daniel Decatur Emmett in 1859. The tune became the Confederate Army's most popular marching song and the unofficial national anthem of the Confederacy, according to Ingram.\nMinstrel shows of the mid-19th century featured White performers in blackface putting on tattered clothing and exaggerating their features to look stereotypically Black. The performances were intended to be funny to Whites, but they were demeaning and hurtful to the Black community.\nDifferent theories, but one conclusion\nThe word Dixie takes on a different meaning for different people.\nMost commonly, it's associated with the old South and Confederate states. Dixie was considered the land south of the Mason-Dixon line, where slavery was legal.\nBut once the term was used in a minstrel song, its correlation with racist ideologies became crystal clear, according to Ingram.\n\"Most historians would agree that Dixie is a word people understand as obviously a reference not just to a place, but a certain kind of ideology,\" said Ingram, a history professor at College of Charleston in South Carolina.\n\"There's no mystery around all this,\"she said. \"People's instincts about this being a problematic term is definitely correct. It's correlated with something a lot darker than just history.\"\nShe added: \"By the time Dixie made it into minstrel shows, it was clearly understood to be more than just a place name. 'Dixie' was the antebellum South, and the lyrics evoke a very nostalgic and romanticized view of slavery.\"\nLady Antebellum is changing its name to Lady A\nGeorge Floyd's death has reignited protests and a national conversation about race, police brutality and social injustice.\nAlong with calls to defund the police, and protesters tearing down statues of men who once championed or traded in slavery, music bands and companies are rebranding and dropping racial terms from their names.\n\"When the Dixie Chicks decided to name their band the Dixie Chicks, I don't think they were trying to come up with an offensive name.

Miller said she was tired and went home to wind down.\nWhen the knock on her door came later, she assumed it was Brooks, but it was a Georgia Bureau of Investigation agent.\nMiller thought the agent maybe had the wrong door, she said.

She told them \"he's in a better place,\" trying to keep it positive and keep her tears to herself.\nMiller painted a picture of a loving father who couldn't deny his children, especially the three girls, anything.\n\"They got him wrapped around their fingers,\" she said. \"There's nothing they can't have ... even when I'm saying, hey, stop, don't give them that, they don't need that.\"\nTheir son, a teenager, has shut down since his father's death.\nWhat Georgia law says about when police can use deadly force\n\"He's numb,\" she said. \"He's not ready to talk about it.\"\n\"I don't think he thinks it could have happened to someone so close,\" that it's not just on television, Miller said.\nThe couple's relationship, she said, was a \"friendship no one could break.\"\nBrooks was a happy person and \"always kept my spirits up,\" she said, adding he \"pushed me to be better\" and to \"grow into the woman I am today.\"\nProtests\nMiller said she's thankful for the protests but called on those taking part to remain peaceful.

And popular music groups such as Lady Antebellum and The Dixie Chicks -- now Lady A and The Chicks -- have changed their names.\nBut in a country where enslaved Black people were so essential in its rise to global power, it's impossible to stamp out every link to its painful history.

We are committed to fostering a greater understanding of slavery in America and supporting the Black community,\" New York Life said on its website.\nA company spokesperson told CNN that while New York Life cannot change its history, its long-standing recognition of that history has helped shape its commitment to the Black community.\nYale University\nYale University is named after Elihu Yale, a former slave trader.\nAmid racial injustice protests across the country, the hashtag #CancelYale began trending in June. It began with a bulletin on 4chan -- the online message board that frequently features extremist content -- according to the Yale Daily News. It then gained steam after Jesse Kelly, host of the nationally syndicated show \"I'm Right with Jesse Kelly,\" tweeted that Yale University was named after slave trader Elihu Yale.\n\"I call on @Yale to change it's name immediately and strip the name of Yale from every building, piece of paper, and merchandise. Otherwise, they hate black people. #CancelYale,\" Kelly's tweet read.\nWhile the motivation behind the hashtag may have been to troll liberals and cancel culture, there is some truth behind Yale's namesake. Elihu Yale was a slave trader who profited from the sale of human lives. The school's president told the Yale Daily News in June that there has been no consideration in changing the school's name.\nNFL stars call on Clemson University to sever all ties with John C. Calhoun, the slave-owning former US vice president whose plantation became its campus\nYale has also launched the Yale Slavery and Abolition Portal to help researchers and students \"find primary sources related to slavery, abolition and resistance.\"\nYale University turned down CNN requests for comment.\nYale has also addressed a building named after a leader who supported slavery. In 2017, after months of campus protests, the school changed the name of one of its undergraduate residential colleges to Grace Hopper College from Calhoun College, named after John C. Calhoun, a white supremacist who called slavery a \"positive good.\"\nMany US universities also have ties to slavery. Harvard and Princeton had presidents who owned enslaved people. At public universities like the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the University of Virginia, enslaved people worked on campus or helped build campuses. Some schools, like Georgetown University, sold enslaved people to pay off debts and keep the school running.\nCSX Transportation\nA CSX freight train passes through Homestead, Pennsylvania, on February 12, 2018.\nCSX Transportation owns a railroad that was built by enslaved people.\nThe Richmond, Fredericksburg & Potomac Railroad in Virginia -- acquired by CSX in 2003 -- owned and hired enslaved Black people from 1834, when it was chartered, until the end of the Civil War in 1865, according to The Virginia Museum of History and Culture.\nBank of England joins British companies in apologizing for slavery\n\"The company shares the nation's deep remorse for the shameful institution of slavery and racial discrimination that has occurred in the country,\" Cindy Schild, a CSX spokeswoman, told CNN in an email. \"CSX opposes any form of discrimination and is committed to raising awareness regarding racial disparities.\"\nJack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey\nJack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey.\nThat's right, even alcohol is connected to slavery.\nThough Jack Daniel never owned enslaved people, he did learn to make whiskey in Tennessee from an enslaved person named Nathan \"Nearest\" Green, who was owned by a Lutheran minister, according to the company.\nDaniel bought the business from the minister, then hired Green as his first head distiller.\nMinnesota's constitution still allows slavery as a punishment for crimes. Now lawmakers are trying to change that\nThe New York Times shed light on Green's story in 2016. Since then, Uncle Nearest, a new whiskey brand honoring Green, has emerged. The whiskey is an \"all minority-led business,\" according to its website.\nSvend Jansen, a Jack Daniel's spokesperson, told CNN the company has \"known and been public about the special relationship between Jack Daniel and Nearest Green for many years and it is a common story in Lynchburg, (Tennessee).\" Several of Green's children and grandchildren eventually worked for Jack Daniel's Whiskey, Jansen said.\nJack Daniel's installed a Nearest Green exhibit at its visitor center in March 2018, Jansen said.\n\"We continue to be thoughtful regarding other ways to honor the story of Nearest,\" he said.\nWall Street\nWall Street orignated as a slave market in the 1700s.\nBefore Wall Street became the world's largest stock exchange, the location thrived as a slave market between 1711 and 1762, according to JSTOR Daily, a digital library.\nIn 2015, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio commemorated a marker to the enslaved people who laid the foundation for Wall Street.\n\"This place reminds of us of one of the worst chapters in our history,\" de Blasio said at the time. \"Three-hundred-four years ago, with the approval of the city government, this became a place for buying and selling and renting human beings.\"\nPeople are again talking about slavery reparations. But it's a complex and thorny issue\nNew York City's first lady, Chirlane McCray, said slavery built the foundation of the city and its slave market was rivaled only by the market in Charleston, South Carolina.\n\"You could come here any day and see it happening and somehow it was considered normal in this city. It continued elsewhere in the city for close to 80 years more,\" de Blasio said.\nThe White House and US Capitol Building\nThe exterior view of the south side of the White House.\nFormer First Lady Michelle Obama caused a stir in 2016 when she said enslaved people built the White House. She wasn't wrong.\nConstruction on the original White House began in 1792. Officials planned to import European workers to help build the structure, but recruitment didn't go as planned so they turned to Black people, free and enslaved, according to the White House Historical Association.\nThe US Capitol building was also constructed with the labor of enslaved people. The building's construction started in 1793. Like with the White House, officials struggled to find skilled labor so they turned to enslaved people, who were often rented from owners. Congress unveiled a marker in 2012 honoring the enslaved people who built the Capitol, according to the Architect of the Capitol.\nStorm clouds fill the sky over the US Capitol Building.\n\"So when you see that slave labor was used on the Capitol and White House, it's not just about the personal relationships between the founders and slavery, it's about a national and institutional matter that the government itself was involved in slavery,\" said Adam Rothman, a Georgetown University history professor who specializes in slavery.\nAfter Obama's 2016 comments, the White House Historical Association began aggressively researching slavery and its relationship with US presidents and the White House, said Matthew Costello, a senior historian at the historical association.\nThe research helped form the website \"Slavery in the President's Neighborhood,\" which launched in February.\n\"We have to give those people their voices back. Historically speaking, people are interested in presidents and first ladies, but what about behind those closed doors? Who are the people that really make the White House function and operate?\" Costello told CNN.\nGeorge Washington\nAn oil on canvas of George Washington.\nThough George Washington's ties to slavery are fairly well known, the extent of those connections may surprise some.\nEnslaved people formed part of Washington -- literally.\nThough folklore depicts Washington with wooden teeth, there's no evidence to support that claim, according to historian Alexis Coe, who wrote the best-selling biography \"You Never Forget Your First: A Biography of George Washington.\"\nThe first president's mouth, Coe said, was full of the teeth of walruses, hippopotamuses and enslaved people. Washington paid the enslaved people an under-market rate for their teeth, Coe said.\nCoe said Washington also signed the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793, which allowed enslavers to arrest fugitive enslaved people and reclaim them as property.\n\"The propensity to put Washington on a pedestal does us no favors,\" Coe said. \"It keeps us removed from the man himself, because it's a dishonest reading of his life.\""}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/27/us/ole-miss-university-mississippi-name-controversy/index.html", "headline": "The Battle over Ole Miss: Why a flagship university has stood behind a nickname with a racist past", "published_date": "2020-07-27", "text": "(CNN)Cities, colleges and even the US Capitol are seeing growing battles over statues or building names after the killing of George Floyd.\nThe University of Mississippi is facing a fight over its very identity.\nLike other universities, the state's flagship campus in Oxford is not generally addressed by its full name. For more than a century, it's been called Ole Miss. It sounds like folksy shorthand for Old Mississippi.\nThe term's actual origin is more unsettling.\nIn 1896, a fraternity-backed council asked students to name the new school yearbook. Student Elma Meek proffered Ole Miss.\nShe borrowed it from the vernacular of the antebellum \"darkey,\" who used it as a term of reverence for the slave master's wife, Meek told the university newspaper in 1937.\nThe story, which explains how the term became \"the valued possession\" of the university at large, ran under the headline: \"Ole Miss takes its name from darky dialect, not abbreviation of state.\"\nThe day's biggest stories in 10 minutes or less.\nSign up and get access to videos and weekly student quizzes.\nSign Me Up\nNo, Thanks\nBy subscribing you agree to our\nprivacy policy.\nPlenty of students and alum say the name has evolved to embody all that's good about the northwest Mississippi school and its traditions. Others -- including many Black students, who make up 12.5% of the student body in a state where African Americans compose triple that percentage of the population -- point to Meek's words and ask: How could Ole Miss mean something else?\n\"I had often heard old 'darkies' on Southern plantations address the lady in the 'big house' as 'Ole Miss,'\" Meek told the school paper 40 years after the term's advent. \"I have never thought much about the matter, for I never dreamed, of course, that the term would grow into such popularity and favor.\"\nShe felt the term was a tribute to Southern women, the paper reported.\n'We will continue to use the terms'\nTo be clear, this isn't breaking news. The Ole Miss origin story is an open secret. Two sources, with something less than conviction, offered an alternate theory -- about a train that ran from Memphis to New Orleans -- but the tale doesn't withstand academic or journalistic rigor.\nOn its own website, the university explains Elma Meek Hall, which houses the art department, is named for \"the student who submitted the name Ole Miss for the name of the annual yearbook; Ole Miss subsequently became synonymous with the University of Mississippi.\" A cached version of a 2013 university yearbook webpage also credits Meek.\nA Confederate statue on campus is lowered as part of relocation process earlier this month.\nThe university declined CNN's requests to discuss the matter with the chancellor or provost, saying, \"Our leadership is absorbed with Covid-19 planning as we prepare to resume on-campus operations safely.\"\nIn 2016, then-Chancellor Jeffrey Vitter tamped down concern about the university retiring Ole Miss or its mascot, the Rebels, saying the university would continue to use them because they're popular and have taken on new meanings. A Rebel was no longer a Confederate; she or he was now \"someone who bucks the status quo,\" he wrote.\n\"I can assure you that we will continue to use the terms Ole Miss and Rebels as endearing nicknames for the university,\" Vitter wrote.\nUM has been here before\nThe Battle of Ole Miss hasn't materialized with the same intensity as fights over Robert E. Lee statues, but on a campus with so many remnants of the Confederacy in an era of increasing intolerance for the tributes, it could be next. Traditionalists have been steeling themselves for it, gathering on social media to preemptively defend Ole Miss' honor.\nThey see what's happened across the nation since Floyd's death. His killing ignited a simmering movement to redefine the legacies of Confederates and other historic figures -- and statues have dropped like bowling pins since.\nTributes to Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson and Jefferson Davis have already fallen. Military bases with Confederate namesakes, such as Fort Benning and Fort Bragg, are in the crosshairs. Vice President John Calhoun's name was stripped from buildings Clemson. His statue fell in Charleston. Princeton nixed President Woodrow Wilson. In some instances, protesters have pulled the tributes down themselves.\nTo understand the coming conflagration, know the University of Mississippi has been in a state of war over ideas for more than two decades. Its 1997 \"stick ban\" was viewed as a slick way of getting Confederate flags out of football games without irking alumni. UM booted its mascot, Colonel Reb, six years later. It stopped flying the Confederate-themed state flag in 2015. It quit playing \"Dixie\" at games. The school, too, has rechristened buildings and added \"contextualization plaques\" to others, some built by slaves.\nGuard Blake Hinson transferred to Iowa State, citing UM's ties to the Confederacy.\nUniversity leaders were more resistant to demands they take down a 30-foot Confederate monument that has stood prominently on campus since 1906, but the statue was relocated this month. A new controversy sprouted when plans surfaced for a privately funded facelift for the statue's new location that will cost up to $1.2 million. Opponents accuse the university of building a shrine to the Lost Cause of the Confederacy.\n\"It feels like you're in the Upside Down. Everywhere else in the country these statues are coming down,\" UM associate history professor Anne Twitty said. \"You feel like you're fighting the battle of 15, 20 years ago.\"\nThinking back on the struggles she's seen since joining the faculty in 2010, she said, \"The battle over Ole Miss will be particularly hot.\"\nLast month, Blake Hinson, a guard on UM's basketball team, put the school's ties to the Confederacy in the headlines by transferring to Iowa State.\n\"I'm proud not to represent that flag anymore and to not be associated with anything representing the Confederacy,\" the Florida native told The Daytona Beach News-Journal in June. Iowa State would not make Hinson available for an interview.\nAlso last month, the university esports team dropped all references to \"Rebels.\"\nThe dangerous messaging at play\nJack Carey received his master's and doctorate at the university. He devoted a section of his dissertation to \"the invention of Ole Miss\" and is writing a book, \"Jim Crow U.,\" about flagship Southern universities during segregation.\nThe story of Ole Miss' origin, he said, is but one example of the school's deliberate efforts to hitch its image to the Old South and Confederacy. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries -- as old Confederates convulsed at the notion of civil rights and crafted Jim Crow laws to strip Black people of rights -- the university covered the campus with Old South iconography, Carey and others say.\n\"There's really no ambiguity about what (Elma Meek's) tapping into: a romanticized vision of the Old South and slavery,\" said Carey, a University of Alabama instructor of American studies. \"A lot of people don't think that much about it, which makes it all the more important to acknowledge the origin. It's quite a bit to try to explain away or rationalize.\"\nAside from sending an unwelcoming message to more than a third of the state's residents, who are Black -- along with those who feel those residents' lives and feelings matter -- retaining the nickname poses deeper dangers in its messaging, he said:\n\"It requires imagining enslaved people felt affection or endearment toward slaveholders.\"\nIt props up the myth of the White savior, a paternalistic figure who was necessary to civilize the Black race.\nAnd it ignores the brutality, violence and force necessary to maintain slavery.\nBy romanticizing slavery, Carey said, an institution doesn't have to confront it.\n\"To speak honestly about the origin requires a pretty serious reckoning not just with the name but also the institution's identity,\" Carey said.\nBy fighting to keep its name and other holdovers of the Confederacy, he said, the university sends a strong message to prospective Black students: \"Go somewhere else.\"\n\"That is not the way that a flagship state university should be imagining itself,\" Carey said. \"That's really exclusionary in terms of who that university would welcome, and its commitment to academic freedom and diversity of thought.\"\n'I think rebellion is a good thing'\nNot everyone concurs with Carey. On Facebook and in interviews, many students and alumni -- and some would argue most -- feel the same way the university does about keeping Ole Miss. Despite their alignment with university leaders, they worry because the school has defended traditions like Colonel Reb and \"Dixie\" in the past, only to relent under pressure, said Howie Morgan, a 2000 graduate and political consultant.\nMorgan co-founded the Colonel Reb Foundation in 2003 to honor the wishes of the 94% of students who voted that year to keep the colonel, he said.\n\"I think the problem that anyone's going to have in the current climate is the University of Mississippi, through its leadership over the last several decades, has not been honest with the students, alumni and fan base in their argument to change the symbols,\" he said.\nGrowing up with Southern parents in Vicksburg, \"I didn't know what racism was,\" he said. The Confederate flag is just a symbol -- \"the Cowboy hat of the South\" -- made popular by Lynyrd Skynyrd and \"The Dukes of Hazzard,\" he said.\nA Mississippi fan takes a picture with some dressed up a former mascot, Colonel Reb, in 2015.\nThat the Ku Klux Klan and other hatemongers co-opted the flag after the Civil War is just an example of groups stealing symbols, he said: \"The Klan also used an American flag. The Nazis also stole a Christian symbol.\"\nHe frowns on efforts to change Ole Miss or Rebels, echoing his alma mater's assertion that they've taken on new meanings. Those who fought for suffrage and to end child labor were rebels, he said.\n\"I think rebellion is a good thing,\" he said.\nHe worries outside pressure is pushing administrators to \"change from a niche market into a more bland university so we would blend in with all the other universities across the United States.\"\n'We're destined to repeat the bad'\nFor senior Lauren Moses, a columnist for the school paper, the controversial symbols, along with Ole Miss and Rebels, are not honors. They're reminders, she said.\n\"Things that happened around the Civil War, we remember those things. We don't celebrate them, but we remember. I don't think the majority of students who utter the words support neo-Nazis or racism,\" she said. \"For me, Ole Miss means both the good parts and the bad parts of our history.\"\nWhen graduate student Zach Borenstein wrote a February column urging students to stop saying Ole Miss (he'd be charged months later with vandalizing the Confederate statue), Moses fired back with a litany of traditions, including James Meredith integrating the school in 1962, that she associated with Ole Miss.\nJames Meredith sits on a park bench in Jackson with Keri Herrington and Eriyuanna Woods last month.\n\"From changing the school mascot to governing bodies voting to move the Confederate statue to contextualizing many buildings on campus, Ole Miss has lost its identity,\" the 21-year-old wrote. \"Those who do not take the time to understand the importance of tradition may never know the beauty of our campus.\"\nShe sees it as a microcosm of what's happening across the nation, where historic figures such as Christopher Columbus and Thomas Jefferson are removed from the context of their history and unfairly measured by today's norms and moral codes, she said.\n\"I see a sort of nihilism. We're trying to whitewash our history and get rid of everything that's bad,\" she told CNN. \"I think that's dangerous for society and dangerous for Ole Miss specifically. We're destined to repeat the bad.\"\n'If they're not willing to unlearn, we're at a standstill'\nCarl Tart, 22, the university's first homecoming king, faced backlash when he told his family he was attending UM. Relatives disapproved of its racist and Confederate history, he said, but he had attended an all-Black high school in Yazoo City.\n\"I knew the world wasn't going to be all Black,\" he said. \"I wanted to learn how to navigate the world with people who are different from me.\"\nOnce on campus, he'd experience a range of racism. He shared anecdotes about hateful messages Facebook and screen grabs of death threats on Snapchat targeting Black students. Other bigotry he experienced was more Archie Bunker than Bull Connor, he said.\nWhite students at pep rallies couldn't tell star wide receiver D.K. Metcalf from other Black players, he said. They'd blurt out the n-word while singing along with rap music in local bars. At tailgates in The Grove, Tart and other Black students had to check each other's backs to make sure no one put \"Our State Flag\" stickers on them. Unwilling to study in halls named for racists (the contextualization plaques \"didn't go far enough\"), Tart did most of his schoolwork at home, he said.\nDespite his stature, 6-foot-5 and almost 300 pounds, he found himself anxious when a vehicle pulled alongside him bearing the Confederate flag.\n\"I tense up because I have no idea if these people are about to target me. I have no clue what's going to happen from this point forward,\" he said.\nOn June 19, he issued an ultimatum: If his alma mater breaks ground on a shrine glorifying the relocated Confederate statue, count him out of any marketing initiatives expected of him as homecoming king.\n\"It's time for change and change is happening whether people like it or not. We have to start leaving behind these old traditions and these old prejudiced ways and bring positivity to the change,\" he said.\nNow a graduate student at Louisiana State, Tart bristles at the idea Ole Miss can be \"rebranded\" with new meaning. He doesn't understand how university leaders can continue to justify its use, he said.\n\"We're expected to basically assimilate into a culture that's not ours. You can teach a person so many things, but if they're not willing to unlearn, we're at a standstill,\" he said. \"It's not OK you're allowing Black students to live in fear.\"\nA conflicted Black student experience\nArielle Hudson, a Rhodes scholar and outgoing president of the Black Student Union, which has been demanding the removal of UM's Confederate tributes for decades, says changing Ole Miss is trickier than altering the state flag or moving a statue.\n\"The biggest problem is Ole Miss is a brand. It's making money,\" she said.\nThe 22-year-old graduated in May and is destined for the other Oxford, in England, come fall, but she has made the drive from her hometown, Tunica, for campus protests. The statue has spawned a few.\nOle Miss has come to represent the school's strong sports programs and academics, supporters say.\nWhen Borenstein was charged with vandalizing the statue, she raised his bail money because \"his stance was strong. I wanted to help him out.\" (Borenstein's case remains open, according to the Lafayette County Justice Court.)\nAs a young orientation ambassador, Hudson recalls debunking \"wild\" rumors from prospective Black students -- no, the KKK doesn't live on campus; no, they're not still lynching people in Oxford -- while affirming other disturbing elements of the university's history.\n\"Some of this stuff happened, but that doesn't mean you don't belong here,\" she'd tell them.\nShe occasionally wears Ole Miss apparel but takes a harder line on Rebels gear. Her aunt won't wear any of it, she said. Depending on Hudson's audience, Ole Miss might slip out in conversation, but never in interviews or academic settings. Still, Hudson thinks the sobriquet sends a negative message, she said.\n\"I think it definitely means we haven't come to terms with all the history of the University of Mississippi and our role with slavery, with Jim Crow, within the Reconstruction era,\" she said.\nHonesty and transparency are often missing from the debate, she said, echoing a complaint heard from both sides. Administrators too often announce a victory, only to hatch secret plans \"to glorify Lost Cause mythology rather than contextualize Civil War history,\" which is what Hudson believes happened with the statue, she said.\nReal dialogue means listening to all sides and using opposing arguments to hone her own, she said.\nJefferson Davis descendent: State flag should represent population 01:08\n\"You have to get more people engaged with that history and understanding that history,\" she said. \"Education pulls people to your side.\"\nAdministrators also do the right things for the wrong reasons, she and other students and faculty complained.\nThe stadium stick ban was purportedly about safety, rather than denouncing the Confederate flag. Ditching \"Dixie\" and Colonel Reb were couched as efforts to make pregame more inclusive. The new names for buildings and the statue relocation came after a consulting firm said such honors hurt the school's reputation.\n\"That's not the only problem or the main problem,\" she said, explaining that just once she'd like hear university leaders say, \"No matter how much it costs or how much we lose, it's wrong and we're going to take it down.\""}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/07/us/atlanta-georgia-crime-mayor/index.html", "headline": "Atlanta mayor says increase in shootings stems from 'perfect storm of distress'", "published_date": "2020-07-07", "text": "(CNN)Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said Tuesday the increase in shootings and murders in the city and across the country is the result of a \"perfect storm\" of frustration, the coronavirus pandemic and issues with police brutality.\n\"I think it's just this perfect storm of distress in America,\" Bottoms said on \"Good Morning America.\"\n\"I think that that people are obviously anxious, and even angry about Covid-19.

These cities, including Atlanta, New York City, Chicago and Los Angeles, are also seeing a significant decline in other violent and property crimes.\nThere's a rise in shootings but a drop in other crime\nAtlanta Police publishes data on its site weekly of eight serious crimes: murders, rapes, robberies, burglaries, aggravated assaults, larcenies from automobiles, other larcenies and automobile thefts.\nAs of June 27, the latest date for which Atlanta crime data is available, there were 50 murders in Atlanta compared to 46 at this point in 2019, and 41 murders at this point in 2018.\nThis year's murder total so far is slightly below the 55 murders as of the end of June 2016, when cities across the country saw Black Lives Matter protests against police violence spurred by the killings of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile.\nCiting violent crime in Atlanta, Georgia governor declares state of emergency and calls up National Guard\nIn addition, the 282 shooting incidents so far in 2020 in Atlanta is a 19% increase from that point last year, the data shows.\nThe increase is even more stark over the past 28 days compared to the same 28-day period in 2019, as murders in Atlanta have jumped from six to 14 and shootings incidents have nearly doubled.\nBut at the same time, reported robberies, burglaries, larcenies from automobiles, other larcenies, and automobile thefts have declined by at least 14% compared to this same point in 2019 as well as this point in 2018. Aggravated assaults are unchanged from last year's total as of June 27, while reported rapes are down 59%.\nIn all, the total number of serious criminal incidents so far this year is far lower than in previous years.\nAs of June 27 in Atlanta, there have been about 9,500 incidents of those eight most serious offenses -- an 18% decrease from the same point in 2019 and a 22% decrease from the same point in 2018.\nSimilarly, as of the end of June, there were about 12,400 of these eight serious offenses in 2018, 12,200 in 2017, and 13,600 in 2016, according to Atlanta Police data. And all of these totals are well below crime numbers as of the end of June 2009, when there were 18,900 of these incidents.\nIn all, the data is broadly consistent with the nationwide decline in violent crime over the past several decades since its peak in the early 1990s.\nWhy are large cities seeing similar trends?\nThis trend is not specific to Atlanta, as New York City has similarly seen a rise in shootings and murders this year but a decline in most other crimes. New York Police Department officials have blamed the increases on the coronavirus pandemic and protests against police brutality, as well as issues specific to New York like state bail reform and a decline in incarceration at Rikers Island jail.\nGun violence surges in major American cities in the midst of a pandemic and a policing crisis\nCriminologists are still trying to understand why so many American cities have seen similar trends. A report commissioned by the Arnold Ventures philanthropy said homicide rates declined in April and May in most large US cities likely because of coronavirus business closures and stay-at-home orders.\n\"Homicides depend on relatively vibrant activity patterns -- lots of people on the street,\" Richard Rosenfeld, a University of Missouri-St. Louis professor and co-author of the report, told the philanthropy's newsletter. \"When the streets are empty, the opportunities for all kinds of street crime go down.\"\nThomas Abt, a senior fellow at the Council on Criminal Justice and the report's other author, told CNN last week that there appeared to be connection between violence and the \"legitimacy\" of the state and law enforcement.\n\"As legitimacy drops, the people in these communities simply don't use the criminal justice system to mediate conflicts and instead turn to violence,\" he told the newsletter.\n\"We saw a significant increase in homicides after the unrest in Ferguson, Baltimore, Chicago and other places. We may be in for the same thing in the wake of the George Floyd protests.\"\nCNN's Chris Boyette, Ray Sanchez, Brynn Gingras, Kate Conerly and Laura Dolan contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/09/us/texas-atascosa-emergency-chief-coronavirus-trnd/index.html", "headline": "Texas emergency chief who led efforts to secure PPE dies of coronavirus and effects of leukemia", "published_date": "2020-07-09", "text": "(CNN)They called him the \"radar\" of Atascosa County.\nAs the emergency management coordinator of the Texas county, David Prasifka was always on the lookout for how he could help his community.\nSo when the coronavirus pandemic started to creep in, he hit the ground running, searching near and far to procure personal protective equipment for the county's first responders, hospital staff and essential workers on the front lines of the fight against the virus.\nThen last week, Prasifka fell ill, with doctors diagnosing him with acute leukemia, according to Atascosa Judge Robert Hurley, who worked closely with Prasifka on the county's Covid-19 efforts.\nBut then another diagnosis came shortly after. A positive test for Covid-19 -- the very disease he had been \"valiantly fighting against,\" Atascosa County officials said in a Facebook post.\nPrasifka passed away on Saturday from the effects of leukemia and Covid-19, according to his obituary. He was 58.\n\"David had been leading Atascosa County through the COVID-19 pandemic. His humor, heart, and passion for not only his EM job, but his family will be missed by many,\" the county officials added.\nA lifelong dedication to serving others\nBefore he was appointed as Atascosa's emergency management coordinator nearly six years ago, Prasifka served with the Jourdanton Volunteer Fire Department for more than 25 years, first as a volunteer firefighter and then as chief.\nDavid Prasifka served with the Jourdanton Volunteer Fire Department for over 25 years.\n\"David jumps into things feet first. He never ran from a problem,\" Don Penny, the county's EMS director told CNN. \"He looked out for everyone else.\"\nIn his role as emergency management coordinator, Prasifka already wore many hats. He would investigate if somebody got hurt on the job and would take steps to prevent it from happening again. He would prepare the community for any dangerous weather events and update people on any accidents or crimes around the county.\nBut when the pandemic hit and quickly became \"overwhelmingly serious,\" Prasifka \"stepped in at every level,\" Hurley, the county judge, said.\n\"He worked evenings, he got up early in the morning. He communicated with state officials when PPE was extraordinarily short. He scrounged all over the state for it ... Sometimes that involved him driving a couple hundred miles to pick up PPE. It didn't matter how far he had to go, what he had to do to get it.\"\nPrasifka had also led the county's efforts of organizing the state-run Covid-19 testings, helping move the testing sites around different locations to make it easier for people to get tested.\n\"We probably had more (testing sites) in our county than any other that are our size, at least in our area of Texas, and he ran them personally,\" Hurley said. \"There's no question (he helped save lives)... We had extremely low numbers for a county our size until they opened the bars and beaches back up.\"\nAs of Wednesday afternoon, Atascosa county reported 148 confirmed cases and two deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University date.\nTwo heavy diagnoses at once\nTwo weeks ago, Prasifka decided to get tested at one of his Covid-19 testing sites \"just for the heck of it,\" Hurley said, and it came back negative.\nHe had been feeling tired and losing weight, but he blamed it on an abscessed tooth. Then on Monday, he started having fainting spells so he went to the doctor at the strong recommendation of his friends and family.\n\"David was not the kind of person that would go to the doctor,\" Hurley said. The doctor diagnosed him with acute leukemia and he was admitted into a San Antonio hospital, where he was tested for the coronavirus once again, a standard procedure at the hospital.\nThis time, it came back positive.\n\"He called me Friday morning,\" Hurley said. \"He told me what his situation was and that he had tested positive, but that he felt great. They were going to start treating the leukemia and everything was going to be fine. He was upbeat just like he always is.\"\nHurley was later told that night by a family member that Prasifka was put on a ventilator. Then by noon the next day, his organs were shutting down.\n\"At 4:33, he was dead,\" Hurley said.\nContinuing his work\nOn Monday morning, dozens of first responders from Atascosa and the neighboring county of Bexar escorted Prasifka's body from the hospital to the funeral home.\n\"I stood on the side of the road and watched that procession and just cried,\" Hurley said. \"There were fire departments, police departments, emergency management departments from all over.\n\"Everybody is in a state of grief over losing David. We still can't believe he's gone. He was always just there, always ready to help,\" he added.\nPenny, the county's EMS director, has been working to keep Prasifka's work going.\n\"It's a real shame that one of our greatest ones in Atascosa county, the one that was working the hardest to keep us straight died from (Covid-19),\" Penny said. \"I know that I will continue his fight. We worked on this a lot together and he taught me a lot on the aspects of his job.\"\nPrasifka leaves behind four sons, his wife, Donna, and five grandchildren.\nWhile there are no funeral services scheduled at this time, his family is asking that instead of flowers, people donate to leukemia or coronavirus research."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/24/us/florida-coronavirus-cases-surge/index.html", "headline": "What's behind the surge of Covid-19 cases in Florida", "published_date": "2020-06-24", "text": "(CNN)As Florida emerges from its coronavirus shutdown, the state is experiencing a surge of Covid-19 cases, with younger Floridians accounting for a significant number of positive tests.\nThe Florida Department of Health reported an additional 3,286 cases of coronavirus on Tuesday, bringing the state total to 103,503.\nMedical experts and elected officials have attributed the rising numbers to a combination of more testing and more social contact as businesses reopen and, in recent weeks, to people's participation in large protests, although that has not been clearly established.\nNo state has successfully moved out of lockdown with the right tools in place, former CDC chief says\nIn Miami-Dade County, the state's most populous with 2.71 million people, data compiled by researchers at Florida International University shows that the number of positive Covid-19 tests has increased by an average of 35 every day during the past two weeks.\nResearchers also found that hospitalizations, intensive care visits and ventilation use have all begun to increase over the past two weeks. Combined with a rise in cases, researchers say, this evidence points to increased community spread.\n\"Municipalities received guidelines on reopening but they do not have guidelines on when to pull back, which is why it is so critical to monitor the cases closely before the hospitals and ICUs start to have capacity issues -- which is something we have avoided so far in Miami-Dade County,\" said Dr. Mary Jo Trepka, the head of the epidemiology department at FIU.\nPeople are 'out and about'\nHealth experts can't really say for sure why cases have risen, but from the data, it's clear that community transmission is ongoing, Trepka told CNN. \"More people are out and about,\" she said. \"That has most likely contributed to it.\"\nTrepka cited other factors as well, including children being out of school, the Memorial Day weekend and the recent protests in which some demonstrators did not wear masks. New research, however, suggests Black Lives Matter protests across the country have not led to a jump in coronavirus cases.\nTo limit transmission, she said, people should continue to perform the basic practices recommended by health officials over the past three months: Wear a mask, practice social distancing, wash your hands and, most importantly, stay home if you are sick or have symptoms.\nPeople enjoy a sunny day in Miami Beach, Florida, on June 16, 2020.\n\"Stay home until you get the test result back and it's negative,\" she said.\nFlorida is one of the states that does not have a statewide requirement that masks be worn, though the state's health department recommends them.\nLocal governments such as Miami-Dade County require the use of masks. Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, a Republican, told CNN on Monday that large venues where rallies or sports events are held would not be opening and that Miami was not heading into the third phase of reopening because of the rise in cases.\n\"It has really nothing to do with an increased amount of testing. It has to do with more people that are getting tested coming out positive,\" Suarez said.\nThe county is seeing record numbers of Covid-19 patients, the Miami Herald reports. One medical center in Homestead reached its ICU limit on Tuesday after county officials identified it as a hot spot of new cases.\n\"Countywide, hospitals report far more beds available than beds filled with COVID patients. Still, hospital administrators and emergency room physicians say they're concerned by the surge, and that they've resumed near daily meetings with state regulators,\" the newspaper wrote.\nPatients now are younger and not as sick as they were in April, The Herald wrote. That, combined with the knowledge gained then, means shorter hospitalizations and healthier results.\nOver the weekend, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis attributed the surge in cases to \"testing more.\" He said the vast majority of the cases in Florida now are in people with no symptoms.\nCounties such as Broward and Duval have a \"large 20-to-30-year-old population, mostly asymptomatic. But we're also seeing that not only are they testing positive because they're testing more, they're also testing positive at a higher rate,\" said DeSantis, a Republican.\nDeSantis said testing has also increased because of people \"returning to the workforce.\"\nAnother ICU demand surge?\nStates seeing an increase in the number of new Covid-19 cases will face \"another ICU demand surge,\" said Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, director of infectious diseases at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.\n\"There are time lags between the peak numbers we're seeing reported and the consequences that get people into the ICU. So you're looking at this two- to three-week period,\" Marrazzo told CNN on Tuesday.\n\"What makes me very concerned is that we are already seeing a spike in ICU admissions in a place like Florida,\" she said. \"And yet, the cases are continuing to climb. So, we're going to be facing another ICU demand surge in not that long a time.\"\n'It's still deadly': Florida Republicans urge caution as state sees spike in coronavirus cases\nIt is \"really important for us to think about the implications there -- in terms of readiness and in terms of blunting the consequences of these increased cases,\" Marrazzo added.\nDr. Andrew Pastewski, the head intensive care unit physician at Jackson South Medical Center in Miami, is also seeing a surge in patients, he said.\n\"A week ago we had eight patients, none on a ventilator,\" Pastewski told CNN on Tuesday. \"We were feeling like we were handling this well. We had a nice Covid floor, 24 beds with the capability of four ICU ventilators in that unit, so we thought we could use that as our Covid floor going forward.\n\"And within 10 days, we're now at over 40-plus patients, four on ventilators. We've had to find a second Covid unit and are looking for a third Covid unit right now.\"\nPastewski has two sets of patients in the ICU now: older patients who may live in a nursing home, and younger patients in their 50s and 60s, he said.\nSome of his colleagues are not seeing an increase in Covid patients going into ICU units as of now, Pastewski said.\n\"Some of them don't know that there's any kind of Covid surge happening because they only handle the Covid ICU patients,\" he said. \"My group at Jackson South sees every Covid patient in hopes of catching them before they get sick, so I know that the numbers are higher.\"\nThis recent rise in cases among young adults could lower Covid-19 death rates unless those same young adults infect others, according to a tweet from Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\"With younger age of recent infections in at least some places such as Florida, expect a lower death rate in this wave ... until the 20-to-40-year-olds who are infected today go on to infect others,\" Frieden, president and CEO of the initiative Resolve to Save Lives, tweeted Sunday.\nThe shift of the coronavirus pandemic to younger Americans is not necessarily good news, said Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute.\nYounger people are less likely to get sick and less like to die from the virus, Jha told CNN. But even if they aren't sick, they can infect others, he noted.\n\"Those younger people have parents.

You know, lock us away.\"\nRayshard Brooks opened up about the struggles of life after incarceration in an interview before his death\nBrooks told the interviewer he was arrested for false imprisonment and financial credit card fraud.

Two years later, he was sent back to prison for 12 months for violating his probation.\nThe Rev.

Derek Chauvin, who pressed his knee into the unarmed black man's neck, was charged with a new, more serious count of second-degree murder. The three other officers at the scene during his killing have now been charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter.

Protest response\nElite former military leaders have issued unprecedented levels of criticism against President Trump's response to the protests. Former Defense Secretary James Mattis said in a statement that the President doesn't even try to unite the country and that the American people need to find a way forward without relying on his leadership. Retired Gen. John Allen criticized Trump's photo op in front of a church during the protests, saying it was trying to use religion to gloss over an abuse of First amendment rights.

(CNN)Students at Robert E. Lee High School in Fairfax County, Virginia, got in really \"good trouble\" after pushing to rename their high school in honor of late US Rep. John R. Lewis.\nThey felt that the school's name did not appropriately reflect its mission, nor the diversity of its current student body. And after a student-led drive for change, the Fairfax County School Board voted on Thursday to rename the school after the civil rights icon.\nLuna Alazar, a senior at the time, spoke up at the first school board meeting on the subject this fall. She is now 18 years old.\n\"I would like if you imagine being a Lee High School student. We are a tremendously diverse community with strong ambitions and remarkable unity. We are charismatic and full of pride. We have different ideas and imaginations that make us truly unique. However, we are named after someone who doesn't represent us at all,\" she told the Fairfax County School Board in October 2019.\nThe school's student body is largely made up of minorities -- 45.46% Hispanic or Latino, 23.94% Asian, 14.93% White and 12.97% Black, according to the county's website.\n\"It's kind of like a slap in the face to say that we go to Robert E. Lee High School, the Confederate general, the man who was fighting against the Union in favor of slavery,\" Edward Cari\u00f1o, a 15-year-old Filipino immigrant and rising high school junior, said.\nThe day's biggest stories in 10 minutes or less.\nSign up and get access to videos and weekly student quizzes.\nSign Me Up\nNo, Thanks\nBy subscribing you agree to our\nprivacy policy.\nAlazar said that while some alumni present at the board meeting supported the need for a name change -- some saying they were embarrassed to show their children a diploma with the name Robert E. Lee -- others were adamant that changing the name would erase years of Virginian history and Lee's heritage.\nShe said she felt hopeless after that winter meeting. Many older community members who opposed the name change told her she was just a student, without experience or knowledge.\n\"Why should we listen to you?\" they asked.\nThe effort to rename the school, however, was reignited in recent months, inspired by the current national reckoning on racial justice.\nIn June, during a virtual meeting of the school board, many students, including Alazar and juniors Amanda Hurst and Nour Kassem, stressed that they are the current face of the school and that they have to deal with the ramifications of the school's name every day.\n\"It feels very ungenuine for all of us to say, 'Black Lives Matter,' if our school's name is Robert E. Lee and we haven't tried to change the name,\" Hurst, 16, said in an interview, speaking to the reason many students spoke up en mass this summer.\nFollowing community-wide pleas for change, the school board announced it would hold a one-month period of public comment on possible new names. Name suggestions included Mildred Loving and Cesar Chavez.\nAt the end of that period, the school board voted unanimously to rename the school after Lewis.\n'Good Trouble' in action\nLewis, a champion for civil rights, famously inspired young people to stand up for what they believe in.\nWhen asked about Lewis's legacy and how they will honor his commitment to civil rights, Fairfax County students shared that, in part, they have already embodied 'good trouble' by fighting to rename their school.\nWith plans to create a social justice committee, and discussions around revising the school's curriculum to be more representative of their diversity, these students will continue to speak up for change in their community.\nEdward Cari\u00f1o, 15\n\"We are using our voices to ruffle people's feathers in order to make some good change, because in order to make change, I mean, some people are going to be opposed to it obviously... (we're) using our voices to advocate for what's right.\"\nLuna Alazar, 18\n\"I still stood up and I still fought, even though many people were against me or didn't care about what I had to say. And I think that's 'good trouble' because you're fighting for a cause that means more to you than it does to many... it supports many that have been so lost. So many students at my school who feel like they aren't supported, felt supported after this name change. They felt that they were heard because before they didn't feel like they had a voice, but now they know they do.\"\nFarva Khan, 16\nFarva Khan\n\"We're planning on starting a new committee for our class at John Lewis called the social justice committee to highlight students' civic engagement and activities and opportunities because John Lewis was an advocate for young voices, and we believe it's the best way to honor him. And we want students, like he stated, to get into 'good trouble' by using their voices to advocate for change.\"\nRawan Hashim, 15\nRawan Hashim\n\"We want to have a 'good trouble,' committee, we also want to meet and talk and get the word out to other students about any social injustices. We have a lot. From everything going on right now, we did notice that our community needs more awareness. A big issue right now is racial injustice. The school's named after John Lewis. It's very important for them to know what he did in terms of fighting against racism.\"\nAmanda Hurst, 16\nAmanda Hurst\n\"We think (Fairfax County Public School's) curriculum is very White-washed and very Eurocentric... It's supposed to be world history, yet we don't learn about women, we don't learn about people of color, and we're hoping that we can push for (Fairfax County Public Schools) to really change their curriculum and really remove the White-lensed glasses that are currently on it.\"\nNour Kassem, 16\nNour Kassem\n\"In my history class, government class actually, we learned about Martin Luther King's, 'Letter from a Birmingham Jail.' And I know he talked briefly about, if you know something is wrong, test the limit, and if a law is wrong, you know, break it... so you can show how wrong it is. I feel like that kind of represents 'good trouble' in a way, where you're causing trouble to show light on something... I think it's like the protests, you know, they wanted to show how unjust everything was, and I guess you could say they got into good trouble, and things are changing now.\""}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/12/us/videos-jail-custody-death-sterling-higgins-invs/index.html", "headline": "Videos raise question about in-custody death deemed an 'accident' by Tennessee officials", "published_date": "2020-06-13", "text": "(CNN)Within hours of his call to 911 outside a convenience store, Sterling Higgins lay dead, after video shows him being forcibly restrained on the floor at the Obion County Jail in Union City, Tennessee.\nA surveillance camera video from that morning, 15 months ago, shows a correctional officer gripping Higgins' neck and head for nearly six minutes, and part of that time his arresting officer with one foot on him. Then, Higgins' limp body was dragged to a restraint chair and wheeled into a cell.\nThe video, submitted in a wrongful death lawsuit filed in federal district court in Tennessee, is at the heart of another claim that yet another black man needlessly died in custody because of law enforcement misconduct. All the defendants have denied the allegations in legal filings.\nSterling Higgins\nThose videos were never shown to a grand jury that, last October, declined to indict any of the officers involved, as first reported by WSPD, in Paducah, Kentucky. The 27th District attorney general, Tommy Thomas, told CNN he didn't see the need to show jurors the video because he already had decided not to seek criminal charges against the officers.\nHe said that while he doesn't believe the officers handled the situation correctly, \"that's a long way from being criminally responsible for a homicide.\"\nEdwin Budge, a Seattle-based attorney representing Higgins' estate, said the videos are crucial evidence and that the grand jury \"should have been provided with those facts; and now it's our job as civil attorneys to bring these facts to light.\"\nWe offer several ways to reach our journalists securely.\nHiggins's death raises questions not only about the events of that night, and the officers' use of force, but also about police training and practices in how to handle people behaving bizarrely or who seem to be mentally distressed.\nNathan Tilly, the attorney representing the three corrections officers named in the suit, declined comment, other than to say, \"we've denied the allegations.\" John Burleson, the attorney representing the arresting officer, Robert Orsborne, declined comment. In court filings, Orsborne denied causing Higgins' death. All the officers claimed qualified immunity, a doctrine that holds officers immune from personal liability for acts done in their official capacity unless they violated a clearly established law or constitutional right. The city and county also denied wrongdoing.\nAccording to Union City police records, Higgins, 37, called 911 from the parking lot of Pocket's Market, a convenience store. He told police that someone was following him, trying to kill him and steal his money. According to the complaint, one of the officers \"suggested to Mr. Higgins that he probably needed to go to a hospital,\" based on how he was behaving. Attorneys for the defendants denied this allegation. He agreed to leave.\nOfficers place Sterling Higgins into a restraint chair in the Obion County Jail in Union City, Tennessee.\nBut officers soon returned, after another 911 call, to find him hiding inside a cooler at the back of the convenience store. They arrested Higgins for trespass.\nBased on his erratic behavior, the complaint alleges, police should have realized Higgins was suffering from a medical or mental-health crisis and taken him to a hospital or mental health facility. According to records, Higgins' estranged wife told investigators that \"he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia but refused to take the medication prescribed to him.\" Budge said he couldn't comment on Higgins' mental health because he hasn't yet seen the underlying medical records.\nUnion City Police Chief Perry Barfield said his department's policy is that \"if someone has a medical condition that warrants going to hospital, then they would transport them there first, but there's nothing in place regarding mental-health issues.\"\nInstead, officers took him to the Obion County Jail. Surveillance video at the jail shows Higgins, handcuffed, running around the police car. Taken inside, he briefly grabbed the hair of a female corrections officer, before being taken to the floor by Orsborne, then held on the floor by officer Waylon Spaulding.\nIn a handwritten statement, Spaulding said Higgins tried to spit at him, so \"I ... put my hand under inmate Higgins' chin in an attempt to keep him from spitting on any other officers.\"\nAs Spaulding gripped Higgins' throat and face, two other jailers put shackles on his feet and legs. While the video is unclear, the arresting police officer, Orsborne, told investigators he put a foot on Higgins' leg, then stood on the leg shackles' chains to help restrain him.\nSterling Higgins with his daughter\nThe video shows Spaulding holding the grip on Higgins' neck, and Orsborne standing over him, for several minutes. Higgins' body goes limp, but Spaulding maintains the pressure for another two minutes, according to the lawsuit. By the time he removes his hands, it has been nearly six minutes in total.\nAt about 1:55 a.m., the jailers drag Higgins' limp form to a restraint chair, the video shows. They wheel him into holding cell 15. A few minutes later, they check him. Spaulding, in his handwritten statement, said Higgins wasn't breathing, so they called emergency medical services. EMS records show they received a call at 2:06 a.m.\nAt 2:15 a.m., an EMS team arrived. Higgins had no pulse and wasn't breathing, according to the EMS report, which described his \"primary symptom\" as \"obvious death.\" The team performed CPR. He was declared dead at a local hospital at 2:52 a.m.\nIn his autopsy report, pathologist Marco Ross noted a small hemorrhage on a muscle on the left side of Higgins' neck. \"He stated the finding did not mean that Higgins was choked or strangled. The injury is common and not fatal,\" said an investigator's report. Ross concluded Higgins' \"death was caused by excited delirium due to methamphetamine toxicity,\" and termed it \"an accident.\"\nBudge said an independent medical examiner is reviewing the findings, as part of the suit, \"and the full facts will come out.\"\nHiggins' post-mortem showed 620 nanograms per milliliter of methamphetamine in his blood. A footnote in the autopsy report stated that \"blood levels of 200-600 ng/mL have been reported in methamphetamine abusers who exhibited violent and irrational behavior.\"\nTommy Thomas, the district attorney general, told CNN that as soon as he found out about the death, he called the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation to do an independent investigation. But based on the autopsy findings \"and other investigative work done by the TBI, it was my determination that there was no criminal liability here,\" he said.\nThomas also said he told Higgins' family \"that there is a much lower standard in a civil responsibility case. Then I recommended that they seek counsel and perhaps proceed with a civil lawsuit. And that's what the family has done.\"\nSterling Higgins with his daughter and her mother, Jennifer Jenkins, the administrator of Higgins' estate.\nThomas added that he refers all deaths in custody to a grand jury, as he did this one, as a matter of policy. But, \"in this case, I did not believe beyond a reasonable doubt that any of those officers were guilty of a crime.\" Typically, grand juries issue indictments when there is probable cause to believe a crime was committed; the reasonable doubt standard is used by trial juries deciding whether to convict.\nTo Budge, the key issue is that Higgins didn't need to die.\n\"I think that there are multiple points in time where Mr. Higgins' life could have been saved,\" he said.\nHe questioned why Higgins needed to be arrested in the first place, rather than being referred for medical or mental-health care. He questioned why, once Higgins arrived at the jail, Spaulding apparently maintained pressure on Higgins' neck for so long.\nThe jail's use-of-force policy states that \"the amount of force applied shall only be as much as is reasonable and necessary to control a given situation.\"\n\"Officers have a way to deal with people who are alleged to be spitting. There was a spit mask available to the officers. Apparently, they never applied it,\" Budge said. \"And it certainly doesn't explain why an officer would keep his hands around somebody's neck or throat area for fully two additional minutes from the point that the person stops moving.\"\nThen, too, he said, \"the fact that medical was not called immediately after he became limp and nonresponsive raises great questions.\"\nThere are also questions about the conclusion that Higgins died from \"excited delirium.\"\nAccording to the National Institutes of Health, excited delirium \"is not a currently recognized medical or psychiatric diagnosis,\" in either the diagnostic manual of the American Psychiatric Association or the international classification of diseases of the World Health Organization.\nOne medical examiner, who spoke on condition of not being named because he wasn't involved in the Higgins case, said that coroners sometimes the term \"excited delirium\" when there were multiple factors and they're not really sure just what caused the death. He said, \"a lot of people don't use that term anymore,\" and that often, it's more useful simply to list all the contributing factors individually.\nBudge also questioned the finding of \"excited delirium.\"\n\"Ultimately, the end goal is to get to the truth and get justice for Sterling Higgins,\" he said, and \"that change is made so that people's lives are protected because nobody, nobody should be in the position of dying in jail when that death is preventable.\"\nIn a statement, Jennifer Jenkins, administrator of Higgins' estate, said, \"Sterling Higgins was a good man who deserved fair and humane treatment. He left behind two young children, who will now grow up without a father. He was treated as if his life doesn't matter. We want the truth to be known. We want accountability. We want justice or Sterling Higgins.\"\nCNN's Curt Devine, Yahya Abou-Ghazala and Collette Richards contributed to this report"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/24/us/five-things-june-24-trnd/index.html", "headline": "5 things to know for June 24: Coronavirus, Justice Department, NASCAR, Mexico, Canada", "published_date": "2020-06-24", "text": "Get '5 Things' in your inbox\nIf your day doesn't start until you're up to speed on the latest headlines, then let us introduce you to your new favorite morning fix.

Coronavirus\nSome alarming Covid-19 trends are emerging across several US states, and officials are desperately pleading with people to stay home, wear masks and keep their distance. California, Florida and Arizona are reporting thousands of new cases each day. And in Texas, health authorities have said new cases and hospitalizations are rising at their fastest rate yet. These are among 26 states -- a number also on the rise -- seeing new cases increase compared with the prior week. Despite warnings that Black Lives Matter protests across the country could lead to a jump in cases, new research suggests that's not happening. Instead, the latest surges stem from the number of places in the country that reopened too soon and too quickly. It's a stark contrast with other parts of the world.

Aaron Zelinsky, a prosecutor on former special counsel Robert Mueller's team, plans to testify that the sentencing recommendation for Trump's longtime friend and adviser Roger Stone was watered down due to political pressure from the \"highest levels\" of DOJ, according to his prepared remarks. John Elias, a career prosecutor in the Antitrust Division, accused Barr of ordering investigations into 10 mergers of cannabis companies because he did not like the industry, according to a copy of his testimony. Their criticism comes just days after Barr's decision to fire Geoffrey Berman, the US attorney for the Southern District of New York, which has investigated Trump and his associates.\nBerman to CNN: I'm just here to do my job 02:40\n3.

It collapsed buildings and prompted evacuations, even damaging hospitals that had been dealing with coronavirus patients. The quake could be felt as far as Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. Tremors were also felt in the capital Mexico City, more than 200 miles away.

Trudeau is now under pressure to do something about the case of the \"two Michaels,\" possibly including facilitating a prisoner swap.

Close to 10,000 people were expected to attend the visitation, which was open from noon to 6 p.m. local time Monday, said La'Torria Lemon, spokeswoman for the funeral home.\nTo comply with social distancing rules, only 15 masked guests were allowed inside the church at a time. Guests were allowed to stay inside no more than 10 minutes after viewing the body. Guests must wear a mask and gloves, and casual attire was permitted.\nMany of the visitors wore shirts supporting Black Lives Matter and stating Floyd's last words, \"I can't breathe.\" With gospel songs playing in the background from artists including CeCe Winans and Kurt Carr, several mourners wiped away tears as they stopped in front of the casket.\nAbbott called Floyd's death \"the most horrific tragedy\" he has ever seen.\n\"George Floyd is going to change to arc of the future of the United States,\" Abbott said. \"George Floyd has not died in vain. He life will be a living legacy about the way America and Texas respond to this tragedy.\"\nAbbott said he is already working with legislators and is committed to working with the family to \"ensure we never have anything like this ever occur in the state of Texas.\" He hinted there may be a \"George Floyd Act\" in the works \"to make sure we will not have police brutality like what happened to George Floyd.\"\nSen. Amy Klobuchar, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, actor Kevin Hart and rappers Master P and Ludacris were also in attendance. Lawmakers from Ghana paid tribute to Floyd in a taped presentation in which Barbara Oteng Gyasi, the minister of tourism, unveiled a plaque and mural.\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott passes by the casket of George Floyd during a public visitation at the Fountain of Praise church, Monday, June 8, 2020, in Houston.\nFloyd graduated from Jack Yates High School in 1992, where he helped the football team win the state title. He also played basketball there, Lemon said. A vigil for Floyd will be held at the high school at 8:30 p.m. Monday for local and national alumni.\n\"The Alumni of Jack Yates is deeply saddened and enraged over the senseless murder of our beloved Lion. We wish to express our support for the family and friends of Mr. Floyd. We along with millions of others across the world demand Justice for this Injustice. We are asking all current and former Jack Yates Alumni to wear Crimson and Gold,\" the school said in a statement.\nBefore moving to Minneapolis, Floyd was well known in the Houston music scene, rapping with a group called Screwed Up Clik (SUC).\nFloyd died last month after former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes during an arrest.\nChauvin has been fired and charged with second-degree murder. Three other officers on scene were charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter.\nProtesters have been marching for nearly two weeks and crowds have only gotten bigger\nSaturday, hundreds of people lined up for a public viewing of Floyd's casket in Raeford, North Carolina, about 20 miles from where he was born.\nMeanwhile, demonstrations against systemic racism and police violence continued over the weekend, with large crowds in Washington, Philadelphia and other cities and towns.\nFloyd's body is already in Houston, according to Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo.\n\"#GeorgeFloyd and his family are safely in Houston,\" he tweeted Sunday.\nIt was \"a big deal for our city to bring him back home,\" Acevedo said. \"He's well known, he's known by a lot of our officers.

But Biden is not planning to attend Tuesday's service.

The movement supports shifting the responsibility to uphold societal order to communities and investing money in them, too. It's a model of policing, some activists point out, many affluent white Americans already experience.\nThe hope is that stronger infrastructure -- and the absence of traditional law enforcement that many in the movement believe unfairly targets black Americans -- will reduce crime and deaths at the hands of police.\nThe movement to pare back the role of police isn't a monolith, though.\nThere are abolitionists who advocate for dissolving existing police departments and removing police from society, like organizers with the Minneapolis police abolitionist group MPD150.\nThere are defunders, who want to shrink police departments and their budgets and reinvest those resources in communities without getting rid of police entirely. Los Angeles Police Commission President Eileen Decker already made a small concession by pledging that between $100 million to $150 million cut from the LAPD budget would be \"identified to further enhance community neighborhood policing efforts.\"\nThere's no precedent for a police-free US, or at least a US where the role of police is limited.\nThe day's biggest stories in 10 minutes or less.\nSign up and get access to videos and weekly student quizzes.\nSign Me Up\nNo, Thanks\nBy subscribing you agree to our\nprivacy policy.\nAnd there are those who sit somewhere in between.

Cullors and McHarris believe in the abolition of police, too, but they also acknowledge that defunding is the first, crucial step. And Vitale supports strictly limiting the role of police so they're needed only to respond to dangerous threats.\nA traffic stop\nHere's what a traffic stop without police would look like 01:16\nMost Americans' contact with police comes during a traffic stop, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. But as recent data proves, routine traffic stops can turn antagonistic for black drivers.\nPolice pull over black drivers 20% more often than white drivers, according to the Stanford Open Policing Project, which analyzed nearly 100 million traffic stops between the years of 2001 and 2017. The data also shows that black and Hispanic drivers were searched about twice as often as white drivers on average. Searches of black and Hispanic drivers were often based on less evidence.\nAnd a 2018 Bureau of Justice Statistics report, which cited data from 2015, found that when police initiated contact, they were more likely to threaten or use physical force against blacks and Hispanics than whites.\nClick here to see an extended interview about this scenario.\nA domestic violence call\nDe-escalation would be the key to domestic violence calls 01:39\nAbout 1.3 million domestic violence incidents happened between 2006 and 2015, a Bureau of Justice Statistics report found. Although 56% of those incidents were reported to police, the offender was only arrested or charged 39% of the time.\nThe offender was arrested or charges were filed during the initial police response in just 23% of those reported incidents, the report found.\nMany domestic violence victims feel uncomfortable contacting the police for help. A 2015 National Domestic Violence Hotline survey of more than 600 women who had experienced partner abuse found that more than half of respondents said that calling the police would \"make things worse.\"\nAbout 80% of participants who hadn't previously called police were \"somewhat or extremely afraid\" to call in the future, 70% were afraid that calling would make things worse and 59% were afraid that police wouldn't believe them.\nThe survey responses don't reflect the efficacy of law enforcement's response to domestic violence, but they do suggest that victims lack trust in police to effectively handle their cases.\nClick here to see an extended interview about this scenario.\nA school shooting\nCould school shootings really be handled without police? 01:29\nSchool shootings are a terrible feature of American life, and the US hasn't been able to stop them. Over the last two decades, lawmakers have paid to bolster police presence in schools, a largely unstudied solution, to prevent gun violence. But the problem of school shootings remains, even with more school resource officers on US campuses.\nInitiatives that have involved police, like hiring school resource officers and installing metal detectors haven't been shown to decrease the likelihood of school shootings, and many of those measures were installed without evidence to support their efficacy, according to a 2017 review of studies on safety measures enacted over the last two decades.\nAfter the Columbine High School shooting in 1999, Congress allocated more than $800 million between 1999 and 2005 to support the hiring of over 7,000 school resource officers.\nAnd after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012, the Justice Department's Office of Community Oriented Policing Services dispersed $125 million among more than 260 cities and counties to create new law enforcement positions to protect schools.\nClick here to see an extended interview about this scenario."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/09/us/stephen-jackson-desean-jackson-anti-semitic-remarks/index.html", "headline": "Ex-NBA star Stephen Jackson says remarks about DeSean Jackson were twisted, but apologizes", "published_date": "2020-07-09", "text": "(CNN)Former NBA star Stephen Jackson issued a muddled apology for defending NFL wide receiver DeSean Jackson's anti-Semitic posts, saying he's sorry for using \"the wrong words,\" but that his comments were being twisted.\n\"I could've changed my words, but it's nothing I said that I support any of that,\" he told CNN on Wednesday. \"I could've switched up, but that's the end of it. I know I love everybody and that's how I always stand, and I'm not going to let anybody demean my character.\"\nHe has spoken to his Jewish friends, he said, and they know he wasn't trying to defend Adolf Hitler or the despot's ideals. He was merely pointing to what he felt were inequities between the Philadelphia Eagles' treatment of DeSean Jackson and their handling of a white wide receiver who uttered a slur seven years ago.\n\"That's the end of it. They can twist it how they want, but that's exactly what it is. I don't hate nobody,\" he said.\nStephen Jackson on what is justice: 'We never had it, so I can't answer it' 07:18\nStephen Jackson, 42, who also works as a basketball analyst, was a friend of George Floyd and became a fixture of Black Lives Matter protests after his pal was killed by Minneapolis police.\nHe stepped forward to become a voice for Floyd and Floyd's daughter, Gianna, and applauded the demonstrations and embraced his role as a leader and adviser in the movement to secure justice for Floyd's family.\n\"(Floyd) would love everybody screaming his name and away in Iran and the Netherlands and all that stuff. He appreciates all of that,\" he said in a June interview with CNN.\nBleacher Report columnist Mike Freeman believes Stephen Jackson, with his latest remarks, may have extinguished all the goodwill he garnered during the BLM protests, he said.\n\"He said some really passionate, smart things and was a really good almost spokesperson for what's happening,\" Freeman told CNN, \"and now I think this destroys it all. It obliterates it all.\"\n'He's speaking the truth. Right?'\nFollowing backlash to posts in which DeSean Jackson misattributed an anti-Semitic trope to Hitler and said that Jewish people planned to \"extort America\" and achieve \"world domination,\" the 33-year-old apologized.\nIn his apology post, the Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver said he will \"fully educate\" himself and work with local and national organizations to \"be more informed and make a difference in our community.\"\nNew England Patriots wide receiver Julian Edelman, who is Jewish, acknowledged his NFL counterpart said \"ugly things\" but stated he saw \"an opportunity to have a conversation\" with DeSean Jackson. The Eagles wide receiver has already accepted an invitation from Chairman David Adelman of the Horwitz-Wasserman Holocaust Memorial Plaza to tour the Philadelphia plaza and attend an educational session, Adelman wrote.\nNFL star apologizes for anti-semitic social media post 03:20\nStephen Jackson still weighed in, however, saying in a now-deleted Instagram video that while he read the Eagles' statement on their receiver, DeSean Jackson was merely \"trying to educate himself, educate people, and he's speaking the truth. Right? He's speaking the truth. You know he don't hate nobody, but he's speaking the truth of the facts that he knows and trying to educate others.\"\nLater, he sent out an Instagram post saying, \"Your races pain doesn't hurt more than the next races pain. Don't act like your hardships or more devastating then ours. And u wonder why we fighting for equality. Common sense ain't common. Truth Hurts. Never waste time explaining to people who never supported u anyway. Free Game.\"\nPressed on why he appeared to defend DeSean Jackson after the latter apologized, Stephen Jackson said his words were more related to the Eagles' treatment of DeSean Jackson, in juxtaposition to how the team responded to the now-retired Riley Cooper using the n-word in 2013. Cooper is white.\n\"Maybe I could've been more clear of what I thought DeSean was correct about, but I didn't feel the need to go into a conversation that me and him had about how they were treating him and Riley Cooper. I could've just changed those words,\" the 14-year NBA veteran said.\nRiley Cooper v. DeSean Jackson\nIn 2013, Cooper was caught on camera threatening to \"fight every n***er here\" after being denied backstage access to a concert. The Eagles fined him, saying the organization was \"shocked and appalled,\" and Cooper's behavior and attitude had no place in society.\nThe Eagles on Tuesday issued a similar statement about DeSean Jackson's remarks, using some of the same words, and said they were having conversations with their wide receiver and other personnel. The team is also weighing what actions to take, the statement said.\n\"We are disappointed and we reiterated to DeSean the importance of not only apologizing, but also using his platform to take action to promote unity, quality and respect,\" the Eagles tweeted.\nStephen Jackson speaks at a demonstration in Minneapolis on June 11.\nAsked again why he would co-sign something DeSean Jackson had retracted, Stephen Jackson replied, \"Nice try. I've been out here fighting for justice, for equality, and I was speaking on equality -- why they wasn't handling Cooper and DeSean Jackson any other way.\n\"Like I said, they can twist how they want to. You didn't hear a word out of my mouth saying I hate Jews. You didn't hear a word out of my mouth saying I'm supporting Hitler. They can twist it how they want. I don't hate nobody. I've been standing for everybody.\"\nHe'll continue that fight, he said, \"and that's just the end of it.\"\nEx-NBAer explains another Instagram post\nStephen Jackson further said nobody would be able to find video of him saying he hated anyone. Presented with a separate instance on Instagram in which he appeared to employ during a live conversation another Jewish trope -- alleging the prominent Rothschild family controlled the banks -- Stephen Jackson again touted his love for everyone.\n\"We was talking about money, and when I said that, he didn't take it the wrong way,\" he said, referring to an unidentified person involved in the Instagram chat. \"He said that people with money wasn't associated with Jews, and I just asked him that. It wasn't an insult, and he didn't take it as an insult. ... We had a good conversation, so the person I'm talking to understood what I was saying and he didn't take it as an insult. I don't think nobody else should.\"\nFamily patriarch Mayer Amschel Rothschild is credited as the progenitor of the modern financial system, and his family is often the target of anti-Semitic tropes and conspiracy theories.\nEx-NBA star Stephen Jackson: George Floyd was my brother 01:50\nStephen Jackson concluded his CNN interview, saying, \"I apologize for my words and I could've switched up, but that's the end of it. ... I'm not standing up here apologizing for a job. I don't work for nobody. I'm apologizing because what I stand for is love for all who have love for all, and I mean that -- and that's where I draw the line.\"\nPittsburgh Steelers offensive lineman Zach Banner has urged his fellow people of color to remember they need to \"put our arms\" around the Jewish community as much as they do each other, and Stephen Jackson said he concurred.\n\"I definitely agree. I just want that same energy when we're getting killed in the street,\" he said.\nStephen Jackson played for eight teams during his career, snaring a ring with the San Antonio Spurs in 2003. The Port Arthur, Texas, native was a forward and guard who could score, rebound and assist. His hard edge and leadership skills earned him the nickname, Captain Jack.\nCNN's Scottie Andrew and Don Lemon contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/31/us/five-things-july-31-trnd/index.html", "headline": "5 things to know for July 31: Coronavirus, election 2020, economy, stimulus, hong kong", "published_date": "2020-07-31", "text": "Get '5 Things' in your inbox\nIf your day doesn't start until you're up to speed on the latest headlines, then let us introduce you to your new favorite morning fix.

Coronavirus\nSome people who have never had the coronavirus may still have some immunity to it, which could reduce the severity of an infection. How? A new study found individuals who showed some immunity had T cells that were reactive, possibly from exposure to other strains of coronavirus. (Remember, the current strain is just one of many.) Now, scientists want to know more about the role these T cells play in fighting the disease. Another study about the presence of genetic material from the virus in children has raised questions about whether young kids are more likely to transmit it. That's not exactly encouraging news, with many children in the US headed back to school soon. Of the 15 biggest school districts in the country, 10 will begin the school year with online learning only.\nSee how risky your choices are right now 02:53\n2. Election 2020\nPresident Trump floated the idea of postponing the November presidential election, prompting swift and unequivocal pushback from both sides of the aisle. Trump criticized mail-in voting in a tweet and said, \"Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???\" The bottom line is, he doesn't have the authority to do that. Congress sets the election date. And GOP leaders like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy and Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz made it clear the election has never been delayed and never should be delayed. Many critics see the suggestion, even if it doesn't amount to anything, as a clear threat to the American democratic process. Meanwhile, Trump's campaign canceled a series of ad buys over the next few days to review messaging.\nTrump questions whether US should 'delay the election' 03:00\n3. Economy\nAmerica's big economic comeback is sputtering as coronavirus cases pick back up. The US economy contracted at a 32.9% annual rate from April through June, its worst drop on record, and unemployment claims rose for the second week in a row. The grim economic data caused stocks to sink as newfound uncertainty about the predicted economic rebound grows. Not everyone is feeling the pain, though. Amazon and Apple both posted gains this quarter, and Facebook's stock has risen as socially distanced users flock to the platform. Pandemic-era home cooking regimens have boosted Kraft Heinz's bottom line, too.\nUS reports worst economic plunge on record 00:55\n4. Stimulus\nThree key relief programs have either lapsed or are about to expire as Congress continues to debate the next round of coronavirus aid. The $600 unemployment enhancement ends today. A federal moratorium on evictions ended last Friday, leaving more than 12 million renters at risk for homelessness. And the Paycheck Protection Program, which still has $130 billion intended to help small businesses, is set to expire August 8. It doesn't help that, after several days of negotiations following the Republican Senate stimulus proposal, GOP and Democratic leaders are reportedly no closer to an agreement on what to do next.\nThis small business stood for a century, but Covid-19 closed it in months 02:45\n5. Hong Kong\nHong Kong's government has barred a dozen candidates from the city's legislative elections in September and says more disqualifications may be coming. The decision has raised even more questions about the integrity of the contest and the democratic freedoms of Hong Kong citizens. The city continues to feel the effects of the new national security law imposed by China at the beginning of the month.

In the US, young people are testing positive in the South and West as Americans fail to heed mask-wearing and social distancing guidelines. India, which has the fourth highest number of cases in the world, is allowing a religious festival to go ahead in a limited capacity, even as case numbers surge. In Saudi Arabia, the Hajj pilgrimage is still on, though officials will strictly limit the number of people who can take part. South Korea is seeing a \"second wave\" of infections, which a top health official says began during the May holiday period. And Brazil has reported an average of 1,000 virus-related deaths a day over the past week.\nCrematorium busier than ever as Mexico reopens economy 02:33\n2. Primary elections\nVoters in Kentucky and New York head to the polls -- or face absentee ballot deadlines -- today, as Democratic incumbents and establishment favorites square off against progressive challengers. In Kentucky, former fighter pilot Amy McGrath is up against progressive state Rep. Charles Booker. Until a few weeks ago, McGrath was considered a shoo-in to take on Sen. Mitch McConnell in November. But Booker's campaign has seen a surge in momentum as the nation reckons with racism and police brutality and a pandemic that disproportionately hurts minorities and the poor. Interest in the race has increased turnout expectations and intensified fears of long lines at limited polling sites. In New York, newcomers Jamaal Bowman and Mondaire Jones are campaigning to replace the state's two longest-serving House members, Rep. Eliot Engel and Rep. Nita Lowey. And Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is also defending her seat.\nMeet the candidates trying to unseat Mitch McConnell 02:45\n3. Rayshard Brooks\nRayshard Brooks, the 27-year-old Black man who was shot and killed by an Atlanta police officer this month, will be laid to rest today. His family and friends will honor his life in a funeral service at the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. served as a co-pastor. King's daughter, the Rev. Bernice King, will speak at Brooks' funeral. The Rev. Raphael Warnock, senior pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church and a Democratic candidate for US Senate, will deliver the eulogy. Mourners paid their respects yesterday during a four-hour public viewing at the church. Today's private service will begin at 1 p.m. ET.\nBefore death, Rayshard Brooks shared his struggle for redemption 03:09\n4. Law enforcement\nThings are still tense between law enforcement and demonstrators protesting police brutality. Seattle's mayor told protesters who had taken over a police-free \"autonomous zone\" that it's time for them to go home. The demonstrators wouldn't be removed by force, she said, but the city would work with Black-led community organizations to persuade them to leave the area. In California, employees of a sheriff's and district attorney's office were among those arrested after multiple people were caught on a security camera vandalizing a Black Lives Matter sign, authorities said. And in Minneapolis, where ex-officer Derek Chauvin was charged with murder in the death of George Floyd, eight corrections officers at the jail where Chauvin is being held say they were briefly barred from his floor the day he was booked because of the color of their skin.\nCNN goes inside Seattle's autonomous zone 02:42\n5. Immigration\nThe Trump administration is once again barring immigrants from coming to the US -- this time through a number of new restrictions on visas for temporary foreign workers. A wide range of workers, from au pairs to software engineers, will be blocked from coming to the US until at least January, though there are exceptions. Trump's argument: The devastating economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic has forced officials to do more to protect American jobs. But immigrant rights advocates and tech companies that rely on the visa programs to bring in skilled workers aren't buying it. They accuse the Trump administration of using the crisis to further its immigration agenda and say the restrictions will ultimately hurt the economy.\nTrump: Immigration order to apply only to green cards 02:59\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\nJoel Schumacher, director of Batman movies and 'St. Elmo's Fire,' has died\nHe was best known for directing the divisive \"Batman Forever\" and \"Batman & Robin\" films in the '90s.\nSchumacher: 'Batman' is for the audience, not for me (1997) 00:59\nA package of smelly fruit sent 6 people to the hospital and caused an evacuation\nThat's one heck of a stench.\nApple wants your iPhone to replace your car keys\nGreat news for those of us who are always losing stuff.\nWidgets, face mask Memoji, car keys: Here's what's new on iOS 14 03:04\nWomen are less likely to swipe right on men posing with cats in their dating profiles\nBut do you really want to date someone who would swipe left on your sweet kitty?\nIf you're wondering whether signing that petition will change anything ...\nWell, it's complicated.\nTODAY'S QUOTE\n\"I wanted to show whoever it was that you're not going to take away my smile.

I was standing amid the smoldering ashes of Los Angeles' South Central neighborhood in 1992, when I was a rookie newspaper reporter assigned to cover the Rodney King riots.\nThe viral video that set a city on fire 03:00\nBut the news cycle moved on, and the accounts and videos of black men brutalized by police kept coming. After all the deaths and the protests -- in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014 and in Baltimore in 2015, to name a few -- came the same calls for change and the same rhetoric: This time will be different.\nI've seen how this movie ends. I also covered the Freddie Gray riots, which erupted in the same West Baltimore neighborhood where I grew up. I've seen the same pattern: Exuberant protesters, vows for police reform, and then ... nothing.\nBut after the George Floyd demonstrations I find myself filled with a guarded optimism, even as I wrestle with the fear that nothing will stop these ghoulish videos.\nI see three big reasons why things really do feel different this time.\nWhite people get it now\nMy optimism starts with a painful memory. It was the most heartbreaking confession I've ever heard from a young black man.\nI was interviewing a black family in a gang-dominated neighborhood in Los Angeles not long before the King riots. They lived like moles. Everything in their house -- their furniture, their mattresses -- was as close to the floor as possible. A rival gang had shot into the house so much that they low-walked through the rooms. Bullet holes dotted the walls.\nA member of the family, 17 at the time, said many of his friends had already been killed. He couldn't envision reaching middle age.\n\"All I know is I want to make a baby before I die,\" he told me.\nBusinesses beginning to burn on Pico Boulevard during the Rodney King riots on April 30, 1992 in Los Angeles.\nBefore Black Lives Matter was a hashtag, it was a question mark. I met so many black and brown people in South Central who wondered if white people cared about how much they suffered. They lived in a perpetual crossfire -- terrified of gangs and the Los Angeles Police Department.\nCovering gangs like the Crips and the Bloods was my first journalism job out of college. It may sound exciting, but I was miserable, and sometimes terrified. What I remember most was the isolation of those communities. People felt like they were marooned in impoverished, dangerous neighborhoods by whites who couldn't give a damn about how many of them were murdered.\nRead more from John Blake:\nVoter suppression now has a white face in Wisconsin\nCoronavirus is bringing a plague of dangerous doomsday predictions\nBlack America is being hammered by a double pandemic\nNative Americans were already decimated by a virus. They're scared it could happen again\nHer father was called 'the most dangerous racist in America.' She wants a different legacy for her son\nTrump is doing what Obama couldn't\nBut the Floyd protests have introduced a plot twist that I didn't see coming.\nI've never had so many black friends and relatives call me, all saying the same thing: Did you see all of them white people out there?\nThose who focus on the surprising number of white people at these protests, though, miss an important point: It's not just the number of white people who are putting their bodies on the line, it's the type of white people who are showing solidarity.\nDemonstrators stage a sit-in on Tuesday, June 9, on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles during a protest over the death of George Floyd.\nWe're not just seeing Berkeley radicals at these rallies. Protests have spread to small, predominately white towns -- even places like Vidor, Texas, a former Ku Klux Klan stronghold that Texas Monthly once called the \"most hate-filled town\" in the state. More than 70% of Americans see Floyd's death as part of a larger racial problem, according to an ABC News/Ipsos poll.\nI've never seen so many white people as angry about racism as its victims.\nThis was unthinkable during the King riots.\nMany of the people I talked to in South Central perceived that much of white America saw them as animals. They thought whites were titillated by tales of gang violence and tough LAPD cops. One of my friends called it \"gangster chic.\" But most whites didn't seem interested in learning about the type of racism that made some black people's lives so miserable.\nThey are now. When President George W. Bush releases a statement asking, \"How do we end systemic racism in our society?\" something has changed.\nMore white people are saying what Andy Stanley, a prominent white evangelical pastor, said during a recent sermon on the Floyd protests: It's no longer enough to be a non-racist; one must be an anti-racist.\nDemonstrators gather in St. Paul, Minnesota on June 5, 2020, to protest he death of George Floyd.\nThe Floyd video was an Emmett Till moment for white America, one professor told me.\n\"Perhaps the tipping point of violence against black citizens has finally broken though the apathy of the dominant majority, such as Emmett Till's open casket and the images of his brutalized face (that) finally snapped many Americans out of a delusional belief that America was great for all,\" says Susan Peppers-Bates, a philosophy professor and director of the Africana Studies minor at Stetson University in Florida.\nOne of my friends put it best when he called me one recent night after watching white demonstrators square off against police in riot gear. He declared:\n\"White people get it now.\"\nThe Floyd protesters have the perfect villain\nMy optimism is also based on another encounter with a young black man. This one took place five years ago in Baltimore.\nThe experience literally hit home for me.\nI'd been sent to the city to cover the unrest over Gray, a black man who died while in police custody. The epicenter of the riots was in the same neighborhood where I grew up. National Guardsmen with assault rifles patrolled outside the house where I played with friends.\nI spotted a teenager in braids leaning against a sign at a nearby bus stop. He scowled as I approached. Everyone seemed angry that day.\nPeople walk past burning cars near the intersection of Pennsylvania Avenue and North Avenue in Baltimore on April 27, 2015. Riots erupted in the city following the funeral service for Freddie Gray, who died while in Baltimore Police custody.\nHis name was Malik, and he told me he was angry at Baltimore's mayor for calling young protesters \"thugs.\" He didn't think any of the city's political or law enforcement leaders cared about young black men like himself.\n\"They talk about 'We the future,' but they killing us,\" Malik, then 15, told me.\nThis wasn't a South Central rerun. Malik was angry at black people, not white people. The city leaders he castigated were all black.\nEvery protest movement needs a focal point for its wrath. The civil rights movement had a racist antagonist, Alabama lawman \"Bull\" Connor. The #MeToo movement has movie mogul Harvey Weinstein. But the Freddie Gray protests didn't really have that, and I think it hurt them.\nI detected a palpable letdown in my old Baltimore neighborhood when people finally saw the pictures of the six police officers arrested in connection with Gray's death. Half of them were black. The city's police chief and mayor were black. How could protesters claim that Gray was a victim of racist cops and politicians when Baltimore was controlled by black leaders?\nPolice officers from previous protests faded from public view like phantoms. Many have forgotten their names.\nThe Floyd protesters, though, may have the perfect villain in President Trump.\nIntentionally or not, he has mobilized protesters.\nPresident Donald Trump walks past police in Lafayette Park after he visited St. John's Church across from the White House on Monday, June 1, 2020.\nMany were outraged by his tweet saying, \"when the looting starts, the shooting starts.\" The use of smoke canisters and pepper balls to remove protesters so Trump could hold up a Bible in front of a church backfired by turning out more protesters, Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said.\n\"You have a leader who is thoroughly incompetent and inept in this moment,\" Bryan Adamson, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio, told me. \"He has managed to fan the flames of racism.\"\nPolice culture won't be the same\nAnother memory from 1992 Los Angeles suggests to me that this time may be different.\nIt's when I met one of the most notorious police chiefs in America. His name was Daryl Gates, and he was chief of the Los Angeles Police Department during the Rodney King riots. A veteran of the US Navy, Gates helped spread the militarization of police departments around the nation.\nGates once told a US Senate committee that casual drug users \"ought to be taken out and shot.\" He said that more blacks died from police chokeholds because their arteries were not the same as \"normal people,\" a remark for which he later apologized. Under Gates' command, the LAPD used an armored personnel carrier to bash in suspected drug houses.\nDemonstrators protest outside Los Angeles Police Department Headquarters after the verdict in the Rodney King case.\nGates was forced to resign from the LAPD in 1992. But until now I have never seen so many police officers break publicly with the military culture that's embedded in so many departments.\nPolice officers have knelt with and marched with protesters. Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo asked his department to provide escort services for Floyd's body upon his return to the city for his burial.\nThe days of big-city police chiefs acting like Gen. George Patton may be over. The potential legal and political costs are too high.\nBesides, there's something about the Floyd video that hits at law enforcement in a way that other videos didn't, says Adamson, the Case Western professor.\n\"I think many officers, especially black and brown, had to be wrecked by what they saw,\" Adamson says.\nPolice officers kneel during a rally in Coral Gables, Florida, on May 30, 2020 in response to the death of George Floyd.\nThe Floyd video could lead to concrete changes in police culture. Already, all four Minneapolis officers who were filmed arresting Floyd have been arrested and charged in his death. Other police departments have also taken swift recent action against officers accused of misconduct.\nPoliticians are getting involved. The Minneapolis City Council has pledged to defund and dismantle the city's police department in the wake of Floyd's death. Such steps could include everything from dismantling the structure of the city's police force to dramatically reducing its budget.\nCongressional Democrats released a package of proposed police reforms, and some local governments are banning chokeholds. Republicans, and the White House, are discussing reforms as well.\nSimilar reforms have been tried before, including after the Rodney King, Ferguson and Freddie Gray protests. But the movement has more momentum now.\nAnd what if it's still not enough?\nIf protesters ultimately help make policy, and not just noise, my optimism may be validated.\nThe US Congressman and civil rights icon John Lewis recently said something that's crucial: \"The vote is the most powerful nonviolent tool we have in a democratic society.\"\nA Trump victory in November, though, could derail any momentum generated by the protests, says Christopher Huff, a history professor at Beacon College in Florida who studies protest movements.\n\"It would be devastating,\" Huff says. \"If what's happening now translates into an electoral defeat in November, that would be an indicator that what's been going on may have lacked a grounding to effect long-term change.\"\nDemonstrators denouncing systemic racism and the police killings of black Americans rally in Washington Square Park on June 6, 2020, in New York City.\nI'm familiar with this kind of disappointment. I've seen the hope for police reform rise and fall. I try not to return to the level of pessimism that I once felt while listening to the young man who only wanted to make a baby before he was murdered.\nBut now I have a new fear. What if this time really is different, but that's still not enough to affect meaningful change?\nWhat if I keep seeing a succession of unarmed black and brown people struck down on videos? What if one day it's someone I know -- or me?\nAnd yet in other moments, I also believe that true change is possible. The price of police brutality is becoming too high to pay. There is a new generation of black, brown and white anti-racists who will change America.\nIn truth, I bounce between hope and skepticism: This time won't be different. This time will be different.\nIt may not make sense to believe both. But it's better than what I once felt: no hope at all."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/25/us/wilmington-north-carolina-police-officers-fired-trnd/index.html", "headline": "Three police officers fired after they are caught using 'hate-filled speech,' chief says", "published_date": "2020-06-25", "text": "(CNN)Three Wilmington, North Carolina, police officers have been fired after they were heard on video spewing \"hate-filled speech\" and referring \"to Black people as the n-word,\" Police Chief Donny Williams said Wednesday.\nThe officers were identified as Officer James Gilmore, Corporal Jesse Moore II and Officer Kevin Piner. According to a report that details the findings of an internal investigation, Piner and Moore also criticized Williams, who is Black. Piner and Gilmore criticized other Black police officers in the department.\nAt one point, according to the report, Officer Piner said he was \"ready\" for a civil war and talked about \"slaughtering\" Black people, referring to them by using the n-word.\n\"I can't wait,\" he said. \"God, I can't wait.\"\nEach officer was a veteran of the department, having been hired in the late 1990s, according to employment records released by the city.\nThe firing of the officers in Wilmington -- a coastal city about 80 miles north of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina -- comes amid a nationwide reckoning over race and policing following the deaths of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky, and Rayshard Brooks in Atlanta.\nIn a statement Wednesday, Williams said the Wilmington officers' comments were \"brutally offensive and deserved immediate action.\"\n\"This is the most exceptional and difficult case I have encountered in my career,\" Williams said. \"We must establish new reforms for policing here at home and throughout this country.\"\nWilliams said he has recommended that none of the three officers be eligible for rehiring in Wilmington. He said he would notify the North Carolina Criminal Justice Training and Standards Commission to determine whether the officers can maintain certification to practice law enforcement in the state.\nThe department also will consult with the district attorney's office about this case to determine if crimes were committed by the officers, Williams said in the internal investigation documents, and would review the cases the officers had charged to see if there was any bias toward the offenders.\nAdditionally, the police department is asking the courts to decide whether some or all of the video should be released.\nCNN has reached out to the union representing the police department for comment. Attempts to reach each officer were unsuccessful.\n'Put 'em back about four or five generations'\nThe video was discovered on June 4 during a monthly video review, according to the internal investigation report. The footage, captured by Piner's in-vehicle dashboard camera, was classified as an \"accidental activation,\" the report says.\nAbout 46 minutes into the nearly 2-hour-long video, Piner is heard speaking with Gilmore, who has pulled his vehicle up beside Piner's.\nThe two officers discuss recent Black Lives Matter protests, and Piner says that the department's only concern is \"kneeling down with the Black folks.\" Gilmore also describes a video he saw about White people \"bowing down on their knees and 'worshipping Blacks,'\" the report says.\n\"How many times have I told you it's almost like they think they're their own god?\" Gilmore said, according to the report.\nThree men indicted in the death of Ahmaud Arbery\nThe two officers criticized the police department's response to Wilmington protests and made derogatory comments about some of their fellow officers.\nLater, Piner is heard answering a phone call from Moore, who told Piner about a woman he arrested the day before, referring to her with the n-word, the report says.\nAt one point, Moore said that \"she needed a bullet in her head right then and move on. Let's move the body out of the way and keep going.\"\nPiner later said that he believed a civil war was coming, adding he was going to buy a new assault rifle. He felt martial law would be declared and said, \"we are just gonna go out and start slaughtering them f***ing (n-words). I can't wait,\" according to the report.\nMoore said he wouldn't do that, but Piner said he felt a civil war was necessary to \"wipe 'em off the f***ing map.\"\n\"That'll put 'em back about four or five generations,\" Piner said. Moore responded \"you're crazy,\" the report says.\nAccording to the internal investigation report, Moore and Piner also attacked the department's response to Wilmington protests. At one point, Moore said the police chief \"dropped the f***ing ball\" and that there were \"too many times that all he cares about is the f***ing community.\"\nBehavior 'will not be tolerated'\nEach officer was interviewed separately about the comments on June 9, as part of the professional standards investigation. The officers denied they were racists, but did not deny making the statements heard in the video, according to the report.\nMoore said he was off duty and on his personal phone at the time of his conversation with Piner. He said he was just \"venting\" about the arrest he had made and that the recent protests had caused him a lot of stress, according to the report. He told investigators he was embarrassed about the comments and said he doesn't typically speak like that.\nA generation hit by three soul-crushing crises\nPiner also said his comments were not characteristic of who he was and that he found them embarrassing, the report says. Recent protests had caused him a great deal of stress, he said, and made him fear for himself and his family. He pointed investigators to a video he saw on social media that he said showed a Black man calling on people to find officers' homes and kill their families. Piner also said he had reached out to the Employee Assistance Program because he felt he was at a breaking point, the report says.\nGilmore said during the interview that he was speaking about videos he had seen on social media, and that he \"always treats everyone fairly regardless of their race,\" the documents show.\nThe internal investigation found that the officers violated the department's standard of conduct, according to the report, and they were terminated.\nMoore and Piner were also found to have violated the policies prohibiting criticizing the police department and using inappropriate slurs.\n\"There are certain behaviors that one must have in order to be a police officer and these three officers have demonstrated that they do not possess it,\" Chief Williams said in a statement. \"When I first learned of these conversations, I was shocked, saddened and disgusted. There is no place for this behavior in our agency and our city and it will not be tolerated.\""}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/01/us/huntington-beach-stay-home-orders-george-floyd-protest/index.html", "headline": "In Huntington Beach, a George Floyd protest was deemed an unlawful assembly.

But Ventura and Orange Counties allowed citizens to go to the beach, as long as they adhered to a patchwork of guidelines and restrictions, including keeping parking lots closed to discourage outside visitors and limit crowds.\nSeeking relief from the heat, thousands crowded the beaches -- and photos quickly emerged of people packed under the sun in the sand, some not adhering to social distancing guidelines, others not sporting masks.\n\"It's a beautiful day,\" Frank Feerini, who was at Huntington Beach in Orange County, told CNN affiliate KABC on April 25. \"How can you keep anybody in? I think that people want to get out. I think they've been cooped up, I think they're going stir crazy.\"\nPeople enjoy the beach amid the novel coronavirus pandemic in Huntington Beach, California, on April 25, 2020.\nThe images prompted frustration and concern from Newsom.\n\"Those images are an example of what not to see, people, what not to do if we're going to make the meaningful progress that we've made in the last few weeks extend into the next number of weeks,\" Newsom, a Democrat, said of the images showcasing crowds of beachgoers in the state.\nThe following week, he ordered the closure of Orange County beaches, calling it a \"temporary pause.\"\nOrange County officials blamed \"misleading photographs\" for Newsom's decision, saying a telephoto lens made it look like there were more people on the beach than there were in reality.\nMichelle Steele, a county supervisor, said closing the beaches is \"a clear example of unnecessary government overreach.\"\nThe Huntington Beach City Council voted 5-2 in favor of directing the City Attorney to pursue any and all legal actions to challenge the beach closure, a news release from the city stated.\nTurns out, many residents felt the same way as the county's officials. On May 1, between 2,500 and 3,000 people attended protests over Newsom's order, according to Huntington Beach Police Chief Robert Handy.\nLarge protests following California governor's order closing beaches\nWhile the beach was technically closed, officers did not appear to be enforcing the governor's new closure order, CNN reported.\nOut of sight from protesters, riot patrol officers on horseback staged under the Huntington Beach Pier, with one officer telling CNN they were there \"just in case.\"\nOne protester walked past a line of officers blocking access to the beach and asked police officers if he was breaking the law. The officer responded, \"Yes, you are technically entering an unauthorized area,\" but did not stop the protester as he proceeded past the line of officers and to the ocean.\nOrange County reported a 22% increase in coronavirus cases amid protests to reopen beaches.\nThe protest came on the heels of many similar nationwide protests -- in both red and blue states -- over stay-at-home orders. People grew concerned about the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, and demanded the states reopen, even as cases continued to rise and the virus was far from contained.\nAfter the standoff with Newsom, California allowed three cities -- including Huntington Beach -- to begin reopening its coastlines.\n\"I cannot impress upon people more that we're not going back to normal,\" Newsom said. \"It's back to a new normal, with adaptations and modifications until we get to immunity, until we get to a vaccine. We'll get there.\"\nDemanding justice in the streets\nAlmost one month later, as more states slowly began to reopen amid the pandemic, the nation was shaken by yet another incident that provoked outrage.\nHowever, this incident, unlike a global pandemic, felt familiar -- as the nation had seen such police brutality against black people many times before.\nFloyd, a 46-year-old unarmed black man, was killed at the hand of a Minneapolis police officer, who in a video is seen with his knee on Floyd's neck for over eight minutes.\nA check-cashing business burns during protests in Minneapolis on May 29, 2020.\nThe former officer, Derek Chauvin, was fired, along with three other officers, after outrage increased.

Demonstrators funneled their anguish in cities like Atlanta, New York and Washington into chants and signs of Floyd's last few words -- \"I can't breathe.\" While some protests were peaceful, others were marked by chaotic scenes of violence, smashed windows and vehicles set ablaze.\nFive hundred people participated in protests near the Pacific Coast Highway and Main Street in Huntington Beach on Sunday, the Huntington Beach Police Department said.\nThe protest was declared an unlawful assembly after protesters became violent with numerous assaults, and officers observed protesters with weapons such as pepper spray and various impact weapons, the department said.\n\"Multiple weapons including cinder blocks, weights and rocks were located hidden in several of our alleys in the downtown area, indicating a precursor to planned violence,\" police said in a statement.\nHuntington Beach Police said protesters were also blocking traffic on Pacific Coast Highway and refused to leave the area after being asked to do so by officers.\nAs of Sunday night, 17 suspects had been arrested in the city for various charges, police said.\nHuntington Beach joined at least 40 cities in imposing a curfew.

The man disagreed.\n\"He explained that I was subhuman, that I was a different species,\" recalled Newbell. \"And he was trying to use Scripture as proof.\"\nNewbell, 41, chooses her words carefully. But the Knoxville native is candid about the racism she's faced during her ministry, including the past seven years as a community outreach director for an arm of the Southern Baptist Convention.\n\"Too many times to name, I have gone after a speaking event and wept in my hotel room,\" Newbell recalled in a recent interview, \"just realizing how deeply deceived some people are.\"\nSince the death of George Floyd in police custody in May, conservative White Christians have condemned racial injustice in unprecedented ways, with many acknowledging and pledging to fight the persistent scourge of systemic racism.\nWhite Christian leaders have prayed at vigils and marched in protests, damned the officers accused of killing Floyd and recited the slogan Black Lives Matter, often while distancing themselves from the organization of the same name. One evangelical magazine, Christianity Today, called for a church-led reparations project.\nBut even as they appreciate the scales falling from some White Christians' eyes, some Black Christians remain wary.\nTrillia Newbell says her faith has been tested by people who make racist comments.\nThat's especially true of those like Newbell who have spent significant time in predominantly White spaces. Many said they are bracing for a \"whitelash\" -- the moment White Christians tire of talking about race and bristle when Black pastors or congregants want to continue the conversation.\nNewbell said she is optimistic about the possibility of change, but is carefully guarding her heart. In the past, she's been told her interracial marriage is an affront to God, witnessed frustrated Black friends leave predominantly White churches, and -- too many times to count -- been expected to prove that anti-Black racism persists in America.\n\"It is so detrimental to someone's faith when your experience, your reality, is squashed because it's not the other person's reality,\" Newbell said. \"I have experienced that time and time again.\"\nThe sermon problem\nSunday morning has long been known as the \"segregated hour\" in American religious life, when many Black and White Christians worship the same God in separate sanctuaries.\nSome of the division may derive from the pastor's pulpit, according to recent public opinion surveys.\nMore than 6 in 10 Black Christians say it's important for sermons to address topics like racial relations and immigration, according to a recent Pew Research Center study. (Nearly a quarter called it \"essential.\")\nWhite Americans did not agree: More than 6 in 10 said those topics are not essential for pastor to examine, with 40% insisting that race and immigration should not be mentioned at all at church.\nPew's survey was conducted before Floyd's killing made international news and sparked nationwide protests. But Black Christians have been raising alarms about police brutality and systemic racism for decades.\nPastor Joel Osteen joins a march in honor of George Floyd on June 2, 2020, in Houston, Texas.\nAs recently as last summer, only 35% of White Christians said they were motivated to address racial injustice; and less than 2 in 5 believed the United States has a race problem, according to a 2019 poll by the Barna Research Group, a Christian public opinion firm based in California.\nMichael Emerson, a sociologist at the University of Illinois at Chicago, helped conduct that survey and is co-author of \"Divided by Faith,\" one of the most comprehensive surveys on race and religion in America.\n\"The racial gaps are huge on diagnosing the problem (of racism) and determining what we should do,\" he told CNN. \"There are even huge gaps on understanding what racism is and whether it's individual or systemic.\"\nSome of those gaps might have narrowed since Floyd's death. But, as some evangelicals acknowledge, that is not the only problem.\nThe theology problem\nLast month, the National Association of Evangelicals put together resources for churches and pastors to respond to racial injustice and encouraged its members to \"combat attitudes and systems that perpetuate racism.\"\nIt wasn't the first time the NAE, which represents some 45,000 local churches, has addressed systemic racism, said the Rev. Walter Kim, the association's president.\nAppointed last October, Kim is a Korean American and the first person of color to lead the NAE. He said he sees a broader, more active swath of evangelicals engaged on race in recent weeks.\nBut he also acknowledges that evangelicals haven't always been willing to address their racial history or see the wider repercussions of contemporary racism.\n\"There are streams of evangelicalism in which the issue of race has been woefully and inadequately addressed,\" Kim said.\nWalter Kim, president of the National Association of Evangelicals.\nEvangelicalism itself began as a spiritual renewal movement, with a primary focus on saving souls and fostering deeply personal encounters with Christ. Often, larger societal problems are seen as spiritual issues that can only be solved by salvation.\n\"The outworking of evangelicalism's public theology needs to catch up to its understanding of personal transformation,\" Kim said.\nBut like other evangelicals, Kim believes the wind has shifted since Floyd's killing.\n\"When America saw the death of George Floyd with their own eyes on a video played millions of times, it changed something,\" said Ronnie Floyd, a former Arkansas pastor who now heads the Southern Baptist Convention's executive committee.\n\"I really believe it will be a watershed moment for this country.\"\nFloyd, a longtime advocate of racial reconciliation, noted Southern Baptists' public apology in 1995 for its history of slaveowning and said there are a wide variety of views on race among Baptists. He also pointed out that 4,000 of the Southern Baptist Convention 47,000 churches are predominantly African American.\nRonnie Floyd, president of the Southern Baptist Convention, speaking on June 14, 2016, in St. Louis.\n\"Do we have a long way to go in the Southern Baptist Convention? Absolutely,\" Floyd continued. \"Are we making progress? Yes.\"\nBut there are caveats. Emerson noted that only 1% of White Christians worship in a racially mixed or predominantly African American church.\nNearly all of the increase in diverse congregations has been a result of Black and Latino Christians worshipping at predominantly White Churches -- where they haven't always had positive experiences.\nThe 'whitelash' problem\nJemar Tisby, author of \"The Color of Compromise,\" a book about White churches' complicity in racism, calls himself \"post-evangelical.\"\nThe Black Christian historian, who left his predominantly White denomination years ago, said he receives several messages per week from Christians looking to follow in his footsteps.\nHe says many write him after their White pastors minimize or try to explain away devastating incidents of anti-Black police brutality. They ask Tisby, should they leave?\n\"We are telling them to get out,\" he said. \"Especially at this moment, if your churches are not taking a strong stand on racial justice it's unlikely they ever will.\"\nEven when White churches say they are committed to addressing racism, their attention can be fleeting, said Dant\u00e9 Stewart, a writer and preacher in Augusta, Georgia.\nAn Easter sunrise service at Red Rocks Amphitheatre on April 21, 2019, in Morrison, Colorado.\nStewart, who was raised in Black churches, said he became immersed in White evangelicalism while playing football at Clemson University. After school, he and his wife worshipped at predominantly White churches.\nStewart said he was welcomed warmly -- until he started preaching about race. One church, which he declined to name, rescinded its offer to hire him as a pastor.\n\"Stew, you are making too much about race right now,\" he recalls one church leader saying. At the time, Stewart was writing articles in prominent evangelical magazines and being asked to speak on panels. But his church didn't want to hear about it.\nIt was a painful and exasperating experience, Stewart said.\n\"It was exhausting to stay in a White evangelical space,\" he said. \"They may have been around me, but they didn't love me and wouldn't fight for me. That's when I knew I had to leave and return to the Black church.\"\nKristina Brown Button, an author and advocate for racial justice, describes a similar sojourn through White Christianity.\nA mother of five who lives in Virginia, Button said she searched for 20 years to find a congregation and pastor who would make race and racism a top priority.\nShe recalls being the first Black member of her former church in Virginia Beach, which she joined with her future husband 20 years ago. There, Button said she endured years of isolation.\nWhite men addressed her White husband but failed to acknowledge her. Pastors proclaimed deep sadness about racism but were quick to move on to other issues, even after the shootings of Black men like Michael Brown demanded deeper responses.\nButton said she is heartened by what she hears now from White Christians. But experience has taught her that White Christians often balk when discussions get difficult and pastors dread offending White congregants.\n\"It's so rare to see White Christians stick with it unless they have a personal stake,\" Button said. \"I am not going to a predominantly White church again. It was just too painful.\"\nPastor Jevon Washington: \"This is the first time I am seeing White Christians responding in they way they have now.\"\nEven Black pastors said they have trouble engaging White Christians on race. Congregations are more than willing to tackle issues like homelessness and abortion, but racism is often deemed too \"political\" to touch, said Pastor Jevon Washington.\n\"Honestly, the church has been the worst when it comes to dealing with some of these things,\" said Washington, who worked at several predominantly White churches before settling in Rainier Valley in Washington. \"They just don't get it.\"\nSince Floyd's killing, more White Christians are joining the \"woke party,\" Washington said. But they are tardy and inconsistent allies.\n\"This is the first time I am seeing White Christians responding in the way they have now,\" said the pastor. \"But I am deeply saddened that it took a man getting murdered before their eyes to see the problem.\"\nThe Trump problem\nWhen 81% of White evangelicals voted for Donald Trump for president in 2016, some Black Christians viewed it as a betrayal.\n\"When presented with a choice between loving their black neighbors and supporting White supremacy, White Christians chose White power,\" said Stewart.\nIt's more complicated than that, White Christians have protested, arguing that there were many reasons to support Trump over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.\nThe Rev. Albert Mohler Jr., president of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, speaks to reporters in 2015.\n\"The disruption of our political system is not entirely attributable to Trump,\" said Albert Mohler, an influential Southern Baptist and president of the SBC's flagship seminary.\nMohler opposed Trump in 2016 but has said he will vote for the president in November. Evangelicals' political priorities should be abortion, adding conservative justices to the Supreme Court and protecting religious freedom, he said.\nThat's precisely the problem, say Black Christians. Challenging Trump's racial divisiveness is not a priority for too many White Christians, they say.\nFloyd, the head of Southern Baptists' executive committee, has also served on Trump's informal board of evangelical advisers. He said some evangelical leaders have called the White House to register objections \"when certain things happen that are not right.\"\n\"I don't think White evangelicals have been totally silent,\" he said, although he declined to offer specifics. \"Should they have been louder? Probably so.\"\nBut Floyd, who pastored a church for 35 years, said many local pastors are simply overwhelmed and often don't know enough to address difficult topics like racism.\nPresident Donald Trump holds up a Bible outside of St John's Episcopal church across Lafayette Park in Washington on June 1, 2020.\nThere's also the fact that when White Christians look at their congregations, they see a lot of Trump voters. According to a recent Pew poll, 8 in 10 White evangelicals said they would vote for him again.\nMeanwhile, nearly nine in 10 Black Americans do not think the president \"cares about people like you,\" according to a Fox News poll from last month.\nAnd therein lies perhaps the steepest obstacle to racial reconciliation.\nSome Black Christians have laid down a marker, saying that if White Christians vote for Trump in large numbers again, racial relations in this country may be irreparably harmed.\n\"If they have made all of these gestures in the wake of George Floyd's murder, only to go back to voting for a man who embodies racial bigotry,\" said Tisby, the historian, \"it will do more damage than if they had just remained silent.\"\nGeorge Floyd's death was a moment of racial reckoning for many White Christians. The presidential election in November will provide another.\nBlack Christians will be paying close attention."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/29/us/protesters-anger-george-floyd/index.html", "headline": "What protesters say is fueling their anger", "published_date": "2020-05-30", "text": "(CNN)As protesters gather in Minneapolis, Atlanta, Charlotte and other cities across the US, frustration continues to grow over the death of George Floyd.\n\"There needs to be change, officers need to be trained better,\" one protester who was arrested in Atlanta told CNN's Nick Valencia as he was being detained by police.\nA lack of change and police reform are just some of the reasons people are enraged.\n\"This protest is not just about George Floyd, and when people are looking at these protesters -- this rebellion that's going on around the country -- I hope they have some empathy because these people are going home.

In that case, an officer is seen kneeling on the side of Floyd's neck, and this has moved some police departments around the world to start banning neck restraints.\nIn the Oklahoma City case, police have said Scott had a gun and ran from officers who approached him, and that all techniques used to restrain him were proper. The officers were cleared of criminal wrongdoing, Oklahoma City police say.\n'I can't breathe'\nThe incident happened on May 20, 2019, in Oklahoma City. Someone reported that a man had pulled a gun on another man in a parking lot outside a taco truck, according to a 911 call obtained by the Oklahoman newspaper.\nWhen officers arrived around 1:40 p.m., they found a suspect, Scott, and began talking to him, city police Capt. Larry Withrow said.\nScott, 42, initially puts both his hands in the air, but then turns and runs across the parking lot, the footage shows. At least two officers run after him.\nLess than 30 seconds later, an officer catches up and tackles Scott to the ground near a curb, and tells him to put his hands behind his back.\nThe officer straddles Scott's back briefly as he works to gain control.\nAbout 10 seconds after the tackle, Scott says \"I can't breathe\" for the first time.\n\"I don't care,\" the tackling officer, a man, responds, still trying to control Scott's arms.\nA second officer -- a woman -- yells, \"Keep your hands behind your back.\" The male officer tells Scott to keep his hand out of his pockets.\nThe female officer says, \"I'm going to Tase you,\" as she helps to subdue Scott.\n\"I can't breathe, please,\" Scott says, less than 15 seconds after he made the first plea. \"I can't breathe.\"\nThe male officer, then kneeling beside Scott, straddles him across the back, appearing to try pull Scott's arm behind his back to be handcuffed.\nWhen a third officer arrives, she tells Scott, \"Stop, stop resisting now.\"\nAs all three officers work to put him in handcuffs, Scott continues to repeat: \"I can't breathe.\"\nOnce Scott is in handcuffs, the male officer switches from the straddling position and puts one knee on the back of Scott's leg.\n'He's acting like he's unconscious'\nNearly a minute later, as the officers attempt to roll Scott over, one of the female officers can be heard saying, \"He's acting like he's unconscious.\" One of the officers removes a gun from Scott's pocket as he lies handcuffed, face down in the grass. Scott can no longer be heard on the recording.\nAbout three more minutes pass without Scott saying anything. As the officers discuss details of the takedown before rolling Scott over on his side, he appears to be unconscious.\nA female officer says, \"I'll hold this leg down, but we need to get his knee, like, a little bit bent so that if he is not faking.\"\n\"Stay with us, man,\" the male officer says, as he appears to tap on Scott while his knee remains on Scott's leg.\nIn an image captured on the camera, Scott appears passed out.\nThe male officers says, \"He's not really,\" and begins to knead his fist into Scott's chest. Scott's head bobs with no apparent response as the female officer says, \"He's fine.\" A third officer checks his pulse and says, \"He's got a pulse, he's breathing.\"\nDuring this time Scott's face remains mostly off-camera. He is silent and his legs do not appear to move while the officers wait for an ambulance, which officers had called because Scott appeared to be in medical distress, police said.\nAfter about nine minutes, paramedics arrive.\nScott appears alert as paramedics examine him\nThe officer who had been kneeling on Scott stands up and places his foot on Scott's leg as the paramedics inspect him. Together they sit him up, from the back. Scott is holding his own head up and seems to once again be alert. With a jolt he begins to moan and resist the police officers, and they forcefully hold him down on the ground.\nScott's moans descend into a deep cry as officers and paramedics try to stand him up. As the officers lift Scott, he raises his knees as if to try to kick the officers but does not make contact. They continue to lift him onto a stretcher and cuff him to the gurney.\nAfter he was loaded into the ambulance, paramedics told the officers that he had become unresponsive, according to police. One of the officers helped paramedics administer CPR, police said.\nScott was taken to a medical center, where he was pronounced dead at 2:56 p.m., a report from the state's chief medical examiner's office says. That was about an hour after Scott was arrested.\nHe died of a collapsed lung, medical examiner says\nThe cause of death was a collapsed right lung, according to a report from the medical examiner's office.\nPhysical restraint, recent methamphetamine use, asthma, bullous emphysema (an air pocket in the lung) and atherosclerotic heart disease were listed as contributing factors to his death.\nThere was \"no fatal trauma,\" according to the medical examiner's report.\nFollowing an investigation by the Oklahoma City Police Department, the Oklahoma County District Attorney's Office reviewed the case and determined there was nothing inappropriate on the part of the officers, nor any evidence of any misconduct by the officers, police said.\nScott's mother: 'No mother or father should have to go through this'\nScott did have asthma, his mother, Vickey Scott, told CNN.\nVickey Scott said she didn't learn of her son's death until four days after he died. She wasn't allowed to see his body until the day before his funeral, eight days after the incident, she said.\nShe said she hasn't watched all of the body camera video because it was too painful.\n\"No mother or father should have to go through this,\" she told CNN.\nPolice say the officers' moves were proper\nWithrow, the police department spokesman, said the techniques used to restrain Scott are taught at police academy.\nHe said:\n\u2022 About straddling Scott's back: \"(The officer) starts out up on his abdomen area, when he's straddling his back, trying to gain control of him. As they gain more control over the suspect and he's handcuffed, that officer is sliding farther down on the suspect's body to his waist and ultimately to his leg, not restricting any of his ability to breathe at that time.\n\u2022 The female officer who placed her knee across Scott's shoulder blade did this to gain a reasonable amount of control while not restricting airflow, and it offered the \"least likelihood of injuring a suspect.\""}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/13/us/changes-from-protests-george-floyd-trnd/index.html", "headline": "The race-related things that have changed since protests began around George Floyd's death", "published_date": "2020-06-13", "text": "(CNN)As protests around the world continue over police brutality and the deaths of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd, change is happening across the US.\nThis article outlines some changes taking place in public life and police departments.

But on Wednesday prosecutors charged him with a more serious count of second-degree murder.\nChauvin is expected to appear in court next week.\nFloyd's brother, Philonise Floyd, says the charges aren't enough.\n\"I'm never going to be in comfort until those officers are arrested for first-degree murder, not second-degree, not third-degree,\" Philonise Floyd said. \"That was premeditated, and I want justice.\"\nCNN's Madeline Holcombe, Julia Jones, Renee Bahareen, Steve Almasy, Hollie Silverman, Jamiel Lynch and Andy Rose contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/16/us/race-newsletter-july-16-trnd/index.html", "headline": "How do you 'cancel' power?", "published_date": "2020-07-16", "text": "(CNN)For this week, we dive into the cancel culture conversation, revisit Eartha Kitt's run-in with the Johnson administration and look at the tension between White and Black Christians.\nThis week's culture conversation: 'cancel culture'\nBrandon: Have you heard about the Goya Foods controversy?\nLeah: A bit. Fill me in.\nB: After the company's CEO praised President Donald Trump, many Latinos -- the company focuses on the culinary tastes of Latino cultures -- said that they're going to boycott. Predictably, some people, including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and former governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee, didn't like that, and framed the reaction as another instance of \"cancel culture.\"\nWhat comes to mind when you hear that term?\nThe day's biggest stories in 10 minutes or less.\nSign up and get access to videos and weekly student quizzes.\nSign Me Up\nNo, Thanks\nBy subscribing you agree to our\nprivacy policy.\nL: My mind goes to R. Kelly, whom many have tried to cancel for his sexual abuse charges. But his music still gets played, regardless of whether people choose to engage with it. So is it even possible to cancel someone? What does that term even mean?\nB: I think of cancel culture as a sort of shell game: Its detractors say that they're about free speech, about protecting the First Amendment, but what they're really about, it appears, is freedom from criticism and accountability. To me, it's a term that's just so imprecise and incendiary that it's meaningless.\nL: OK, that's true. I agree that the term itself has basically lost all meaning. But it's an interesting concept, if only because it forces people to look at things as black or white: This person is bad, so we have to cancel them, and never again engage with them. Which isn't how life works. I mean, R. Kelly is referenced enough that he still has some cultural capital, you know?\nB: That gets at another problem I have with how cancel culture is tossed around. Most of the people who've been canceled haven't actually been canceled. The supposedly canceled tend to remain influential. R. Kelly's music is still available on Spotify. Dave Chappelle is still releasing comedy specials. JK Rowling is still a global icon and multimillionaire.\nLike \"political correctness,\" cancel culture is a flimsy, facile framework for social and political realities that can't be boiled down so easily. At their core, these are complicated conversations about power, about people -- women and people of color -- making their voices heard after being ignored for so long.\nThink about it: Who are the people usually characterized as cancelers? If we go back to the Goya example, it's Latinos, who are pushing back against a CEO's flattery of a President who's spent his time in office disparaging Latino communities in a racist manner. With Rowling, it's transgender communities and their allies, who are rebuking someone who's trafficking in harmful, essentialist notions of gender.\nL: Exactly! This idea of canceling someone is so vague. Like, remember when Shane Gillis, who was almost on \"Saturday Night Live,\" was fired for his racist jokes? So many people were all \"cancel culture strikes again,\" rather than actually grappling with the fact that Gillis was merely being held accountable for his actions. These situations always get labeled as \"angry internet mobs go after a celebrity,\" as if the celebrity did nothing wrong.\nB: A friend put it to me like this: \"Tell me your views on cancel culture, and I'll tell you who you are.\"\nIn short: power\nThe mass reckoning playing out across the country -- on university campuses, in newsrooms, on streets -- is about one thing: power. That makes sense, given that America was founded on extending control to a few while withholding it from the rest.\nOr in short: \"everything unsettling that is happening right now, in this moment -- perhaps, in yet another letter you've read -- is about power. who has it, who wants it, how its wielded, and what it means to challenge and upend that,\" as New York Times Magazine writer Jenna Wortham recently tweeted.\nThe historical context\nEartha Kitt and the Johnson administration\nCancel culture: What a hazy term!\nIts critics often conflate First Amendment-enshrined free speech with immunity from disagreement, including on social media. There's a dizzying amount of irony here: The people with healthy platforms -- columns at magazines, lucrative book deals, the White House -- are the ones who often believe that free speech is under siege. Meanwhile, the supposed cancelers are people who, until recently, had very little opportunity to meaningfully shape national conversations.\nHistory offers us an example of what being suppressed actually looks like -- and it's far worse than the sting of Twitter rage. In January 1968, the singer, actor, and activist Eartha Kitt attended a White House luncheon on juvenile crime. (She went reluctantly, according to her autobiography, because she \"felt a con coming on.\") When it was her turn to speak, she excoriated Lyndon B. Johnson's administration and America's involvement in the Vietnam War.\n\"You send the best of this country off to be shot and maimed. They rebel in the street. They will take pot ... and they will get high. They don't want to go to school because they're going to be snatched off from their mothers to be shot in Vietnam,\" Kitt said. \"Because there is a war on and I pray that there will be a just and honest peace -- that still doesn't give us a free ticket not to try to work for better things such as against crime in the streets, for better education and better health for our people.\"\nAfter that event, Kitt's career cratered. According to a 1978 New York Times article, \"the Central Intelligence Agency, asked by the Secret Service in 1968 about Eartha Kitt, produced an extensive report containing secondhand gossip about the entertainer but no evidence of any foreign intelligence connections.\"\nUnable to find employment in America, she worked for several years in Europe.\nIn all that is a lesson about proportion. Cancel culture's detractors may not like suddenly having to engage with historically marginalized groups -- but true, government-sanctioned suppression of free speech and diverging opinions is happening all around them, and has been for a long time.\nRecommended for your eyes and ears\nIs there anything that wouldn't benefit from Viola Davis' presence?\nVanity Fair's latest edition is yet more proof that the answer is no. The photos are stunning: commanding, incandescent.\nBut also fascinating is the history behind the photos: This was the first time a Black photographer, Dario Calmese, shot the cover of the magazine.\nThe photos highlight the importance of telling your own history: Calmese said that his goal was to subvert \"the White gaze on Black bodies, and (transmute) that into something of elegance and beauty and power.\"\nHis work is a world apart from Annie Leibovitz's photos of Simone Biles for Vogue. This difference illustrates that there's still a long way to go in terms of addressing the racial bias of photography.\n\"The Old Guard\" takes the traditional superhero film and turns it on its head. In a genre steeped in both Whiteness and the male gaze (hello, \"Catwoman\"), this Netflix blockbuster, directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood, a Black woman, feels like an action film for everyone else.\nShe takes the backgrounds of Black and gay characters and elevates them in a way that's sweet and focused but not contrived.\nIt just goes to show you how much power White people have had for so long, and it illuminates what other stories we can tell when other people are behind the camera.\nAs many in America begin to have difficult conversations on race, similar questions are being raised in other countries in light of the protests here.\nJust look at France, a country that prides itself on its assimilation narrative.\nThe New York Times explored the cultural shift happening there among first- and second-generation immigrants -- and how this shift could shake up the very essence of French society.\nAround the office\nWhy Black Christians are bracing for a 'whitelash'\nDaniel Burke, CNN's religion reporter, wrote about how Black Christians are bracing for \"whitelash\" -- the moment when White Christians tire of continuing the conversation on race after the death of George Floyd, and once again begin to bristle at such topics.\nHe writes: \"White Christian leaders have prayed at vigils and marched in protests, damned the officers accused of killing Floyd and recited the slogan Black Lives Matter, often while distancing themselves from the organization of the same name. One evangelical magazine, Christianity Today, called for a church-led reparations project. But even as they appreciate the scales falling from some White Christians' eyes, some Black Christians remain wary.\""}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/21/us/demonstrators-reimagine-public-safety-without-police/index.html", "headline": "Demonstrators say public safety re-imagined is a future without police", "published_date": "2020-06-21", "text": "(CNN)Tony Williams remembers pulling into a gas station in rural Minnesota late one night after getting lost on his way back home to Minneapolis in 2018. He saw a couple of police cars parked on the lot and thought he'd ask for directions. Williams, a black man, pulled his car in near them and two white officers immediately jumped out and ran to him, both with one hand on a holstered gun and the other holding a flashlight that shined in his face.\nWilliams did what society conditioned him to do in such situations: he put both hands up in the air.\n\"I was acutely aware as a black man that my life was in danger in that moment if I didn't have the right answers,\" said Williams, an organizer with MPD150, a Minneapolis effort created by local organizers that supports the dismantling of the city's police department and the reallocation of police funding to community-based organizations without a history of violence.\n\"What I needed then was not militarized folks who were worried that they're under attack at any given moment,\" Williams added. \"It really drove home for me that even in the most benign of circumstances, police are a threat to me.\"\nActivists, like Williams, who are calling for the defunding and abolition of police, say the future of public safety doesn't need to include police forces that systematically oppress black people, marginalized communities and communities of color.\nInstead, public safety could mean supporting and funding a network of organizations, health care providers, social service agencies, religious and community leaders and others who provide safety, support and prevention. Directing funding in that way would lead to a decline in crimes linked to poverty and systemic disinvestment, activists say.\nOnce thought to be a pipedream that bounced around activist circles, the idea of public safety without the police forces of today has turned into a viable policy platform in the wake of the death of George Floyd and the protests that have followed. Floyd, a black man, pleaded that he couldn't breathe while he was held down with a knee to his neck by a former Minneapolis police officer.\n\"We are seeing the political shift that is happening in real time here,\" David Kennedy, director of National Network for Safe Communities and a criminal justice professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice said.\n'I have...zero examples of police helping me'\nBut there's no one vision for what a future without today's police would look like.\nOn one end of the spectrum, it means pulling money out of policing budgets and redistributing it to community-based intervention programs and services. Instead of sending an officer to a mental health or a domestic abuse call, for instance, a team of crisis workers who are better equipped to de-escalate and provide rehabilitation services would respond. In that example, some sort of policing force would remain, called on for violent situations.\nOn the other end of the spectrum, the goal is to completely abolish police in the US. Policing, some activists say, profits punishment over rehabilitation because of its origin as slave patrols that paid vigilantes to recapture escaped slaves.\n\"My horizon goal is a future where people are not policed,\" said Kristiana Col\u00f3n, an afro-Latina playwright, poet and co-founder of Chicago's #LetUsBreathe collective, which began in 2014 as a way to support protesters on the ground at the Florissant Avenue encampment in Ferguson.\nCol\u00f3n, who works to bring the abolition of police to Chicago, said she is still recovering from being beaten by officers during the initial days of the demonstrations following Floyd's death.\n\"I have absolutely zero examples of the police helping me,\" she told CNN in an interview, recalling an instance when she couldn't get police to file a report about a break in at her home.\n\"I kept reaching out to them as though that's going to happen. And that's simply not how they function,\" she said.\nPeople walk down 16th street after \"Defund The Police\" was painted on the street near the White House.\nCities are reallocating money from police budgets\nIn the wake of Floyd's death, pushed by activists and the protests that have followed, some cities have announced plans to shift money from police departments.\nIn Los Angeles, Mayor Eric Garcetti and Police Commissioner Eileen Decker announced that the city's police budget would not be increased as planned and $100 million to $150 million would be reallocated to \"further enhance community neighborhood policing.\" New York City Mayor Bill DeBlasio said he would reallocate some of the NYPD's $6 billion budget to youth and social services, reversing an April budget proposal that suggested cutting $400 million from the same programs.\nBut no place in the country has gone as far as Minneapolis recently, where nine members of the city council -- a veto-proof majority -- pledged at a community meeting on June 7 to dismantle the police department in its current form.\nDemonstrators marching to defund the Minneapolis Police Department pause outside the Minneapolis Police and Fire Union Office on June 6.\n'Case study for a new era of how to enhance public safety'\nLast week, 12 city council members unanimously approved a resolution to declare the intent to create a \"transformative new model\" of policing in the city, setting off a year-long process to envision and create a new way to keep people safe.\nFive members also announced their intent to introduce a charter amendment for the November ballot of this year, which would propose the elimination of the Minneapolis Police Department to create \"a new Charter Department to provide for community safety and violence.\" A tedious process, according to local reporters, if it makes it to the ballot and is approved by voters, it would remove MPD from the city's charter and the city could begin to dismantle it. Activists say this would circumvent Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, who has said he's not in favor of dismantling.\nThe council's moves come after years of organizing from community activist groups including Black Visions Collective, Reclaim the Block, Black Lives Matter Minneapolis and MPD150.\nAfter a series of high-profile killings by the police in Minneapolis and demonstrations to demand action, Black Visions Collective along with Reclaim the Block began a campaign in 2018 that organized hundreds of community members to go to city budget hearings and explain to their council members what makes them feel safe. More often than not, the answer was not police presence.\nThose efforts bore fruit after video of Floyd's death went viral and protests began.\nMinneapolis Councilmember Steve Fletcher said police weren't responding to 911 calls during the initial days of the protests, so community leaders and activists started emergency troubleshooting. Some of his colleagues, Fletcher said, broke curfew to organize neighborhood watches while he and others took calls and emails from citizens to resolve issues in the middle of the night.\n\"We were deeply engaged in the kind of community problem solving and crisis work that both brought people together and showed people how much community capacity for problem solving we have. And also, prompted a lot of in a very tough conversation among us informally,\" Fletcher said.\nExactly what dismantling the police department in its current will look like in Minneapolis is unknown. Some say they don't want it to look like Camden, New Jersey, which broke its police unions, hired more officers for less money and implemented reforms, but residents still experience aggressive surveillance and policing, according to criminology professor Brendan McQuade.\nStill, Fletcher says he's heard from his constituents that they'd like to have some sort of tactical force with the capacity to respond to dangerous situations. The rest will be decided with massive input from the community and organizers, along with the city council.\nTwo police officers stand outside the Third Police Precinct during the \"I Can't Breathe\" protest on May 27 in Minneapolis.\nResponding with prevention in mind\nIn a police-free future, activists described a world where communities decide what behavior is allowed and highlight the importance of neighbors -- not as watchdogs but as those who can respond with prevention in mind.\n\"There will be a focus on in-the-moment de-escalating a situation, and also making sure that everyone involved has the resources that they need,\" said Molly Glasgow, a member of MPD150.\nThe restorative process will focus on understanding why the issue happened in the first place, Glasgow said.\nIn the case of a robbery or violent crime, Williams highlighted the use of community patrols that arose during the demonstrations in effort to guard against crime for the short term, until more money is invested into social services.\n\"Our neighborhood defense networks were an important part of recognizing that it was a threat and defending folks against it,\" Williams said.\nAnother idea is to use an operator for emergency services that would direct 911 calls to a tactical force, fire department or a mental health crisis line depending on the situation instead of all calls going directly to the police. A version of it is already being used in Austin, Texas.\nAnother option is to deploy crisis teams, similar to the \"CAHOOTS\" program in Eugene, Oregon, that dispatch a medic, and crisis worker trained in the mental health field to each case.\nIn a police-free future, domestic violence cases could be handled not by relying on a carceral system, but by focusing on understanding where violence stems from, be it a mental health problem, a substance abuse problem, an unemployment problem or unaddressed trauma problem, Vitale said. Safety for the victim would be prioritized, as police typically respond to domestic violence calls after they've already been committed.\n\"What we want is a place in the community that people can go to and say, 'I got a problem. I need some help, but I don't want anyone sent to jail. I want to keep this family together if I can.' And if that doesn't work, then 'I need help getting out of this arrangement,'\" Vitale said, adding that communities can create violence centers or women centers with trained professionals to identify resources already present in their lives.\nOrganizers acknowledge the framework has to come together at a quick pace, even as potential challenges loom, including pushback from the police union.\nNon-profits may be guides for cities\nThere are guides for how Minneapolis might create its new reality -- though they exist on a smaller scale as non-profits or community-based programs funded by local governments.\nThe Health Alliance for Violence Intervention is one non-profit example. Used in hospitals in 70 cities across the nation, violence intervention specialists from the same community arrive after a victim has been admitted to the hospital. They sit bedside to run a retaliation screening asking what happened and if the victim is still in danger, while providing supportive resources. And if the victim identifies the perpetrator or a network of community members does, the specialist then goes to the assailant to identify if risks still remain -- hoping to bring both the victim and perpetrator into the organization, halting the cycle of violence and promoting restoration through mediation.\n\"We're able to lower violence and their likelihood of coming back into the hospital with another gunshot wound, we're really focusing on their health and healing,\" said Fatimah Loren Muhammad, HAVI executive director.\nThe process works in large part because they're not asking police-like investigation questions, but asking what the victim needs in effort to create a solution, as victims are less likely to talk to the police after injury, according to DLIVE executive director Ray Winans, a partner of the HAVI in Detroit.\n\"Our approach is never to go after the perpetrator in a sense of an investigation but it's to get the perpetrator and the victim and or the network of folks to sit down and have communication.\"\nAsked what challenges Minneapolis can expect during their transformational process, Muhammad said it's understanding the scale of investment that it will take. And without that, the initiative could fail.\n\"This is not a Band-Aid issue, right? We're talking about structural racism, we're talking about systems that have perpetrated harm or in whole communities for a long time. So, you've got to be very strategic and you've got to invest deeply,\" she said.\nCommunity knows 'best way to keep each other safe'\nEven organizers in favor of abolishing police departments still worry about what the future will look and what mechanisms will be put in place to handle crimes like sexual assault and violence, when the current system goes away.\n\"What are we going to put in place in order to make sure both things don't happen? And that's a larger reimagining of what liberation and freedom looks like for everybody moving forward,\" Fadumo Ali, an organizer and teacher based in Minneapolis said.\nBut organizers and council members, who during the June 7 community meeting asked attendees to write down what makes them feel safe along with their questions and concerns as the first of many conversations, anticipate setbacks.\n\"We actually want to be honest about the fact that it sounds scary because we're like, how are we going to keep ourselves safe? Our assertion is that our community knows the very best way to keep each other safe.\" Noor added.\nReplicating across the nation\nAs Minneapolis pioneers a plan to dismantle its police force, legislators at the federal level are not on the same page. Republicans have been looking to tie Democrats to the issue, while Democrats have voiced support for investing more in communities but not dismantling police forces.\n\"I think that a big part of this conversation really is about reimagining how we do public safety in America, which I support,\" Sen. Kamala Harris said on ABC's \"The View\" earlier this month.\n\"We have confused the idea that to achieve safety, you put more cops on the street instead of understanding to achieve safe and healthy communities you put more resources into the public education system of those communities, into affordable housing,\" among other initiatives.\nMinnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar said she was not in favor of \"abolishing public safety departments and police departments,\" but said conditions can be put on their funding.\nFederal legislators point to reforms like a major bill introduced in the House and Senate Democrats called the Justice in Police Act that would create a national ban on chokeholds as an acceptable use of force, create a National Police Misconduct Registry, provide incentives for local governments to conduct racial bias training for officers, and set caps on the transfer of military-grade equipment to law enforcement, among other initiatives.\nBut advocates of dismantling police forces say cities with some of the worst policing records have passed many of the reforms and not much has changed, as it falls on individual police chiefs to implement them and just lessens the amount of damage done by police officers instead of eradicating it.\n\"When we talk about reform, often what that looks like is more funding for the police justified by, 'oh, we're going to do more training, or we're going to do different kinds of training,'\" said Col\u00f3n. \"Reforms are to police what thoughts and prayers are to mass shootings.\"\nWilliams is one of the people pushing for not just reform, but what he says is transformative change through the abolition of police forces.\nOfficers eventually accepted that he wanted to ask them for directions, he said.\nBut they warned him that should he need directions again, he should park far away and approach officers with his hands up, so as not to look like a threat, Williams said.\n\"Police abolition is ultimately about getting our communities the things that they need to be successful.\"\nCNN's Sarah Moon, Manu Raju, Clare Foran and Aaron Cooper contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/14/us/protest-writing-workshop-philadelphia-trnd/index.html", "headline": "'Protest Writing' workshop gives students an outlet to fight racial injustice and bullying", "published_date": "2020-07-14", "text": "(CNN)On a recent Friday afternoon, a handful of high school students in Philadelphia met over video chat from their respective homes to dissect the lyrics of songs by jazz musician Billie Holiday and rapper J.

For Holiday, it was the 1939 song \"Strange Fruit\" that stunned listeners with its horrifying depiction of black lynchings. For J.

Du Bois and Ida B. Wells and contemporary writers like Ta-Nehisi Coates and Nikole Hannah-Jones. They also analyze lyrics from artists, like Holiday and J. Cole, as well as Kendrick Lamar and Lauryn Hill.\nThe workshop culminates with a final writing assignment in the form of a poem, essay or spoken word, Jeannoute said.\n\"After surveying the history for Black oppression and protest writing, we are now examining current examples of protest writing in journalism,\" he said. \"We facilitated a very engaging conversation about how oppression manifests in almost every aspect of life as POC in America and in underfunded schools.\"\nOver the weekend, students will take time to work on their own narratives, drawing inspiration from the week's conversations.\nJeannoute said he's assigned two writing prompts: In what ways has Covid-19 directly impacted your life and learning? And/or speak about a specific event or instance of oppression. How can you use your voice to bring about change?\n\"We want to highlight the student experience and response but we are asking them to use Dr. Stephen Wilbers' 'Five Elements of Effective Writing,' he said. \"We'll give them the space to tell their story but it needs to be clear and structured.\"\nFrom the front lines, Black nurses battle twin pandemics of racism and coronavirus\nWith the events of this summer being the kind that make history, Jeannoute said he wanted to make sure students had a space to cope with what's going on in the world and discuss and creatively channel ideas.\nProtesting through a social media platform\nZion Perry, 16, a rising junior and workshop participant, told CNN she loves being able to log on from home and learn how to strengthen her writing and voice.\n\"I just want this workshop to help me become the powerhouse that I want to be,\" she told CNN.\nPerry's mom signed her up for the class. Having taken another class with Mighty Writers, she Perry she was excited at the thought of tying her ongoing social justice initiative with lessons from the workshop.\nPerry used to travel over 30 minutes from her Philadelphia home by public transport to get to her private school, Academy of the New Church in Bryn Athyn, Pennsylvania.\nBut since the pandemic forced her to stay at home and transition to an online-only format, she said it also gave her time to reflect on the education she was receiving and the racial inequality she was facing.\n\"It brought me to tears when I thought about how I was treated at my school,\" Perry said. \"There were many teachers at that school that just didn't believe in Black students being smart kids.\"\nPerry said she felt like teachers at Academy of the New Church would openly praise White students but wouldn't speak highly of any of her Black peers.\nThe workshop became a more formal extension of a project Perry was already doing on her own: Using Instagram as a form of protest to show what it is like to be \"Black at\" her private high school.\n\"I wanted to create this platform for Black women and men who don't feel like they're strong enough to stand up for themselves,\" she said. \"I used to be that student that would never speak up for a racial injustice so people could treat me any type of way.\"\nAs protests over the deaths of Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and Rayshard Brooks have filled US cities, Black students and alumni of some of the country's most prestigious private high schools have taken to social media to share their experiences of being Black at majority White elite private schools.\nWhen asked about Perry's account, the school told CNN they are listening to stories from students past and present in an effort to learn.\n\"We support all our students, alumni, and families in courageously speaking out about the hurt they experienced while attending our schools and we thank them for sharing input on how to make our schools better,\" an ANC spokesperson said.\n\"We are using their input and their voices together with other voices and professionals to help in formulating and implementing a plan to move forward with greater love and respect.\"\nAn ongoing fight for justice\nJeannoute said he's humbled to have been able to teach a class of this nature. In his experience, he said private schools provide \"a bit more latitude\" for kids to speak up about their ideas, whereas in public schools, some of those \"kids' voices get lost in the shuffle.\"\n\"This is an opportunity for me to give back to one of my principles of teaching, which is to give a voice to those who have been overlooked,\" he said.\nPerry said she and her siblings will not be going back to Academy of the New Church because of the racial inequality she said she has faced. Her family has moved to the Willow Grove area where she said she plans on attending a new school in the fall.\nAnd though she's changing schools, Perry said she will continue her fight against racial injustice -- because she doesn't want others to fight as hard as she has had to.\nCNN's Madeline Holcombe contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/09/us/confederate-statues-removed-george-floyd-trnd/index.html", "headline": "Confederate statues are coming down following George Floyd's death.

While some cities have already made efforts to remove them, others have passed laws to protect them.\nHere's a look at some of the monuments that have been removed over the past few weeks.\nRichmond, Virginia\nOn July 1, Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney ordered the immediate removal of several confederate statues in a video to the public.\n\"These statues, although symbolic, have cast a shadows on the dreams of our children of color,\" Stoney said. \"Let me be clear, removing these monuments is not a solution to the deeply embedded racial injustices in our city and nation, but is a down payment.\"\nThe work started with the statue of General Stonewall Jackson, according to CNN affiliate WWBT.\nThe mayor said all of the statues that are being removed over the next several days will be put into storage for now.\nOn June 10, a crowd of protesters in Richmond brought down the statue of Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy, according to CNN affiliate WRIC.\nThe statue of Confederate President Jefferson Davis is splattered with paint after it was toppled June 10 in Richmond.\n\"Jefferson Davis was a racist & traitor who fled our city as his troops carried out orders to burn it to the ground,\" Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney said in a tweet June 11. \"He never deserved to be up on that pedestal. July 1, we will begin the process the state requires to remove these monuments to the Old Richmond of a Lost Cause.\"\nHe asked for the sake of public safety that the community allow the city to legally take down the remaining statues professionally.\n\"I will push for us to waste no time on this and to make it happen as soon as possible,\" Stoney said in his tweet. \"Richmond, we will finish the job of removing these antiquated symbols of racism and hate.\"\nIt came a day after protesters vandalized and tore down a statue of Christopher Columbus using ropes at Byrd Park.\nCharleston, South Carolina\nCrews in Charleston removed a statue of politician John C. Calhoun from its pedestal in Marion Square on June 24.\nThe100-foot monument to former U.S. vice president and slavery advocate John C. Calhoun in Charleston, S.C.\nCalhoun, a former vice president of the United States and US senator, is known for defending slavery and owning about 80 slaves himself.

The bottom part of the monument is scheduled to be removed in August, according to CNN affiliate WTKR.\nOn June 11, Norfolk Mayor Kenneth Cooper Alexander announced plans to remove the statue and a day later it was removed. Alexander said at the time that the statue's \"continued presence could lead to injury or violence and therefore must be immediately removed.\"\nThe City of Norfolk said it will hold a public hearing July 7 to determine where the monument will go.\nPortsmouth, Virginia\nProtesters partially dismantled the town's Confederate monument, even completely removing one of the statues on June 10. A man was hit by the statue and went to the hospital with life threatening injuries, according to Virginia State Police at the time.\nProtesters in Portsmouth, Virginia partially removed a Confederate monument and in the process, a man suffered serious injuries.\nMayor John L. Rowe, Jr. said in a statement that Portsmouth Police did the right thing in confining the vandalism to the one piece of public property, so as to protect lives and the remaining private property in the area.\nThe issue of moving or removing the entire monument will be addressed at a public hearing July 28, the mayor said.\nLouisville, Kentucky\nThe John Breckinridge Castleman monument, a statue of a Confederate soldier in the heart of downtown, was removed on June 8, according to an online statement from Mayor Greg Fischer.\nFischer initially announced plans to remove the Castleman monument in August 2018. After a two-year effort to move the statue, a Jefferson County Circuit Court judge said June 5 that the city was able to move the Castleman monument.\n\"We all agree with the report's finding that our city must not maintain statues that serve as validating symbols for racist or bigoted ideology -- that's why we relocated the Confederate statue near the University of Louisville,\" Fischer said in 2016.\nIn announcing his decision to move the Castleman statue and another Confederate soldier statue in 2018, Fischer rejected the idea that moving them was an effort to erase history. \"Moving these statues,\" he said, \"allows us to examine our history in a new context that more accurately reflects the reality of the day, a time when the moral deprivation of slavery is clear.\"\nThe statue will eventually make its way to Cave Hill Cemetery, where Castleman is buried, according to the online statement.\nJacksonville, Florida\nCrews in Hemming Park in downtown Jacksonville took down a 122-year-old statue and plaque that honored fallen Confederate soldiers on June 9, according to CNN affiliate WJAX.\nPlaques in honor of Confederates are seen on the base of a monument in Hemming Park.\nDuring a peaceful protest on the steps of City Hall earlier in the month, Mayor Lenny Curry announced that all Confederate monuments citywide would be removed. This includes three monuments and eight historical markers, the mayor's office told CNN in a statement.\n\"If our history prevents us from reaching the full potential of our future, then we need to take action,\" Curry said. \"My staff will work with the Jacksonville Cultural Council to convene experts in history and art to ensure we acknowledge our past in a full and complete way; a way forward that leaves no person's heritage or experience behind.\"\nBirmingham, Alabama\nDemonstrators at Linn Park attempted to remove a 115-year-old monument during a protest on May 31.\nAn unidentified man walks past a toppled statue of Charles Linn, a city founder who was in the Confederate Navy, in Birmingham, Ala., on June 1.\nMayor Randall Woodfin arrived at the scene, telling the demonstrators he would \"finish the job\" for them.\nThe city's mayor pleaded with demonstrators to disperse before police came to make arrests, adding that he understood their anger.\nThe park houses memorials dedicated to veterans and a statue of Confederate sailor Charles Linn.\nWoodfin did not specify when exactly the monument would come down.\n\"In order to prevent more civil unrest in our city, I think it is very imperative that we remove this statue that's in Linn Park,\" he said at a news conference June 1.\nAbout 54 miles west at the University of Alabama, The Board of Trustees and the university's president, Stuart Bell, authorized the removal of three plaques on the campus that commemorate University of Alabama students who served in the Confederate army and members of the student cadet corps involved in defending the campus, according to an online statement.\nThe plaques at the University of Alabama were in front of the school's Gorgas Library and have now been removed.\nThe plaques were in front of Gorgas Library but were removed and \"placed at a more appropriate historical setting on the recommendation of Dr. Bell,\" a university spokesperson told CNN.\nAdditionally, a group of the university's trustees are set to to review and study the names of buildings on all UA System campuses.\nMontgomery, Alabama\nAbout 90 miles south of Birmingham, demonstrators tore down a statue of Gen.

Wells, was carried away from the city's Capitol grounds on June 1, according to CNN affiliate WKRN.\nThe removal came after demonstrators tore the monument down the previous weekend.\nA week after Carmack's statue was removed, singer Taylor Swift posted a series of tweets detailing the histories of Carmack and Nathan Bedford, calling on Tennessee officials to stop \"fighting for these monuments.\"\n\"Taking down statues isn't going to fix centuries of systemic oppression, violence and hatred that black people have had to endure but it might bring us one small step closer to making ALL Tennesseans and visitors to our state feel safe -- not just the white ones,\" she wrote.\nAlexandria, Virginia\nCrews in historic Old Town Alexandria removed a bronze statue of a Confederate soldier named \"Appomattox\" on June 2.\nCrews in historic Old Town Alexandria are seen removing a bronze statue of a Confederate soldier.\nThe memorial was erected in 1889 to honor Confederate soldiers from the Virginia city.\nAlexandria Mayor Justin Wilson tweeted photos of the statue's removal. \"Alexandria, like all great cities, is constantly changing and evolving,\" he wrote.\nA spokesperson for the city told CNN in a statement that the owner of the statue, United Daughters of the Confederacy, notified the city and said they would remove the statue on June 2.\nVirginia is home to more Confederate commemorations than any other state, according to its governor, Ralph Northam.\nNortham said he's directing that the statue of Robert E. Lee, which sits in the capital of Richmond, be taken down and moved into storage while a decision is made on its future.\n\"In Virginia, we no longer preach a false version of history,\" Northam wrote in a tweet. \"America is once again looking to Virginia to lead. And make no mistake -- removing a symbol is important, but it's only a step. We still need change in this country. We need healing most of all. But symbols matter. We all know it's time. And history will prove that.\"\nMobile, Alabama\nThe city removed the statue of Confederate Adm. Raphael Semmes from downtown and took it to a secure location, Mayor Sandy Stimpson said in a tweet on June 5.\nThe pedestal where the statue of Raphael Semmes once stood is now empty.\nThe monument was moved from a storage facility to the History Museum of Mobile on June 14, Stimpson posted on Facebook.\nStimpson said the decision to remove the statue was not about Semmes or an attempt to rewrite history.\n\"It is about removing a potential distraction so we may focus clearly on the future of our city,\" Stimpson wrote. \"That conversation, and the mission to create one Mobile, continues today.\"\nFrankfort, Kentucky\nThe Jefferson Davis statue that stood in the Kentucky Capitol rotunda was removed June 13, Gov. Andy Beshear tweeted.\nWorkers prepare to remove the Jefferson Davis statue from the Kentucky state Capitol in Frankfort, Ky.\nThe statue was in the building since 1936.

Take it down!\" Others applauded.\nRaleigh, North Carolina\nProtesters removed two statues from the North Carolina Confederate monument at the state Capitol in Raleigh on June 19.\nProtesters lynch a figure pulled from the Confederate monument at the State Capitol at the intersection of Salisbury and Hargett Streets in Raleigh, N.C.\nThe first was brought down by a strap wrapped around the statue's neck, and the second was knocked down on the other side of the monument. Protesters then continued marching and hung both statues from a street light post.\nCity crews began working on removing the rest of the 75-foot North Carolina Confederate monument on June 20 following Gov. Roy Cooper's order for removal.\n\"I have ordered the Confederate monuments on the Capitol grounds be moved to protect public safety,\" Cooper said in a statement to CNN affiliate WTVD. \"I am concerned about the dangerous efforts to pull down and carry off large, heavy statues and the strong potential for violent clashes at the site.\"\n\"Monuments to white supremacy don't belong in places of allegiance, and it's past time that these painful memorials be moved in a legal, safe way.\"\nWashington, DC\nIn Washington, DC, protesters toppled a statue of Albert Pike in the Judiciary Square neighborhood June 19, according to CNN affiliate WJLA.\nPike was a senior officer of the Confederate States Army.\nBristol, United Kingdom\nBritain's imperialist monuments face a bitter reckoning amid Black Lives Matter protests\nWhile there are several Confederate monuments sprinkled throughout the country, protesters across the pond are pushing for the removal of controversial landmarks as well.\nBlack Lives Matter protesters in Bristol, pulled down a statue of 17th-century slave trader Edward Colston on June 7 and rolled it through the streets before dumping it, unceremoniously, into the River Avon.\nBritain's towns and cities are dotted with monuments to figures like Colston.\nOn June 9, London Mayor Sadiq Khan announced a commission to examine the future of landmarks around the capital, including murals, street art, street names and statues.\nCNN's Amanda Jackson, Kaylene Chassie, Travis Nichols, Jack Guy, Carma Hassan, Jennifer Henderson and Rebekah Riess contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/08/us/atatiana-jefferson-siblings-police-violence/index.html", "headline": "As a nation cries for justice in police killings, Atatiana Jefferson's siblings demand she not be forgotten", "published_date": "2020-07-08", "text": "(CNN)Nine months after seeing a policeman gun down his aunt, Atatiana Jefferson, in her Fort Worth, Texas, home, 8-year-old Zion Carr is \"doing,\" his mother says.\nHe has high points and low. He still plays outside, watches TV and loves video games -- the pastime he was enjoying when the officer shot his Aunt Tay through a window -- but \"he has moments when he's not OK,\" Amber Carr, 30, said of her son.\nZion suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, family attorney S. Lee Merritt told CNN. Like many Black children, he's frightened by what he sees going on in the country. His family makes sure he has resources, counseling and plenty of friends to talk to, but the trauma, \"it seeps into his play,\" Merritt said.\nAs Americans face a reckoning over the deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and others, Jefferson's three siblings sat down for a video conference with CNN. They want to remind America that amid its demands for justice in police killings, protesters should not forget their sister.\n\"This literally was one of those situations where this could've been anybody,\" Ashley Carr, 36, said.\n'We're literally just doing normal, everyday things'\nOn October 12, Jefferson was babysitting Zion for Amber, who was recovering from heart surgery. She'd been released from rehabilitation two days prior. Jefferson was a caretaker. She adored family time, whether it was holidays or a game of spades.\nZion and his aunt were playing video games around 2 a.m. when two Fort Worth police officers arrived, responding to a concerned neighbor's call about doors being open at Jefferson's home.\nArtist Nikkolas Smith sought to capture Jefferson's \"final, joyful moment,\" he told CNN.\nJefferson, 28, heard something outside and grabbed her gun. Officer Aaron Dean did not identify himself as police. He demanded, through the window, that Jefferson show her hands before opening fire, killing her, bodycam footage shows.\n\"That is a blessing that I think that we have for ours is that we have a video because how would that narrative have went?\" asked Ashley Carr. \"What we have noticed, even with the Ahmaud Arbery case, is that that narrative is not how the video went. ... If the cameras weren't there, all of a sudden it could've been, 'It was a shootout and blah blah blah,' and we would've had to take their word.\"\nThe family has struggled watching videos of recent police killings.\n\"Revictimization: I didn't think how serious it was until I really started watching other people get killed,\" brother Adarius Carr, the father of a 7-month-old, said. \"I definitely feel the passion, the hurt, the anger rebubble up -- the need to do something, the need to fix our community, the need to figure out what can I do to make this world better for my son and for kids Zion's age. ... It happens every time that I watch it, so that's why I said sometimes I just don't watch it. You can't.\"\nAshley Carr never finished watching the Floyd video, in which a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for almost eight minutes. \"Longest video of my life,\" she said. She's familiar with other killings, and it makes her question the rules. At least during Jim Crow, she said, it was clearer what Black people could and couldn't do. Now, it feels nebulous, she said.\nPolice release censored footage of Fort Worth shooting 02:13\n\"I can't sit in my house and play video games. I can't go out and run for a jog. I fell asleep at Wendy's in my car, and now I'm losing my life. These are crazy things. I can't walk from the store -- Elijah McClain -- and I'm telling you, he's literally telling you he's an introvert,\" she said. \"We're literally just doing normal, everyday things and you can still be killed. That's a crazy place to live in. That's a scary place to live in, but that's the reality of a Black person.\"\nAmber Carr did finish the Floyd video. Upon seeing the 46-year-old plead for his mama, she thought of her sister.\n\"I wouldn't say I felt her or I saw her, but it made me wonder,\" she paused for several seconds, tears welling in her eyes. \"What were her last words? To hear them say their last words, did she cry out for her mom? Did she cry out for someone?\"\n'He wasn't even safe in the home'\nAdarius Carr is already planning to have \"the talk\" -- the Black boys' rite where parents explain they will be treated differently for their skin -- with his infant son, Thaddeus. He doesn't know how the chat will go, but he's locked down the theme.\n\"The best I can tell him is: Make it home to me,\" he said. \"Just make it home, son, as fast as you can. Whatever you have to do, make it home.\"\nIt's a sad reality Black children's parents must prepare for these conversations before their children have reached maturity, said Amber Carr, who also has a 4-year-old, Zayden.\nZion is smart. He knows what's happening. He knows why he's attending protests and rallies, but he doesn't understand the big picture, she said. He's too young.\nFort Worth residents tell leaders 'we don't feel safe' 01:49\n\"The bigger picture is I don't want you go outside and play because they don't like you out there. I want you in the house because I can watch you. I feel like you're safer in the house, but then I can't even say that,\" she said. \"He wasn't even safe in the home.\"\nAt the same time, Zion witnessed and lived through something to which none of his relatives can relate. Zion will occasionally remember a game he played or a trip he took with Aunt Tay and start talking, but his mother doesn't press him, she said.\n\"He actually lived the experience. We as his elders, we didn't experience anything like he's just experienced. I've only watched things like that on television,\" she said. \"I don't ask him questions. I don't know if I don't ask him questions for him or me. Probably for the both of us.\"\nLife as a coping mechanism\nAdarius, Amber and Ashley -- whose mother had dubbed them the A-Team before her passing earlier this year -- try mightily to live normal lives, despite the pall of their sister's killing hanging over them.\nYolanda Carr, their matriarch, was ill when tragedy struck in October. Jefferson had moved home to Fort Worth to help care for her. Yolanda learned of Jefferson's death in the hospital. She was too sick to attend the funeral and sent a eulogy for the pastor to read. Less than three months later, she passed.\n\"Being in the hospital and not being able to be herself and not being able to fight, that's crazy,\" Ashley Carr said. \"It's a lot of emotions that come back up, but through all of these emotions, we all have to still get up and go do jobs. We have to make sure that our kids are ready, that the household is still running -- all while having this on our back. It becomes a lot.\"\nFrom left, Jefferson and Amber, Yolanda, Adarius, Zion and Ashley Carr.\nAmber Carr hears praise about how well she's handling the loss, but there's no magic to it, she said. She has no choice but to persevere.\n\"People ask all the time, 'How do you do it? How do you smile through it all?' It's life, you know? You have to keep living,\" she said. \"I have my moments where I might not sleep for days or I might be in the car and I just start crying. You just have your moments.\"\nLike anyone, there are times when the siblings want to block out the world and forget their woes, but it isn't realistic. They must fight for justice. They must keep their sister's name alive, to ensure people understand she lived for something and died for nothing.\n\"Some days, you do want to just crawl up under a rock and pray that this all goes away. You think you're living in a nightmare, but this is life. This is our new normal, as they call it. We're trying to embrace this new life,\" Ashley Carr said.\nThe Atatiana Project and Sisters of the Movement\nAdarius Carr wishes he could do more. He left home about 12 years ago and now serves as a boatswain's mate in the US Navy. Military obligations prevent him from being as involved as his sisters in activism.\nOne of the family initiatives of which he's proudest is the Atatiana Project, which serves to bridge police and urban communities, and promotes STEM careers -- with an emphasis on coding and gaming -- for children. Jefferson, a biology graduate from Xavier University of Louisiana, worked in pharmaceutical equipment sales and wanted to become a doctor.\nThe Atatiana Project launched on Juneteenth.\nVictim's brother: I'm speechless about this 02:05\nAdarius, 32, loved playing video games with his little sister. Role-playing, fighting games -- nothing was off limits. As kids, they'd play all night and be bushed when it came time to go to school, he said. The memory brings a bright smile to his face.\nThe last time the Navy chief petty officer came home from deployment, he and Jefferson played Warframe for four days -- \"all night giggling, laughing, telling jokes. She's always a class act, always had me in stitches.\"\nToday, he keeps his sister's pillow in his gaming room in San Diego, where he's stationed. He catches himself asking her questions about the games he's playing.\n\"Giving back is a big thing for us in general,\" he said of the Atatiana Project. \"When you're hurting, it is sometimes better to just get people around you that understand the hurt, or you can help them with their hurt. We've been through a lot, and we want to see if we can help the next person.\"\nAmber and Ashley Carr have found solace in another initiative, Sisters of the Movement, an organization founded by women who lost siblings to police violence, including Sandra Bland's, Terence Crutcher's and Shantel Davis'.\nAnother founder, Allisa Charles-Findley, the sister of Botham Jean -- who, too, was killed in his own home by a Texas police officer -- helped Ashley Carr navigate losing a sibling and \"the different things that go on with family dynamics,\" Carr said.\nBotham Jean and Atatiana Jefferson were both killed by police in their homes.\n\"We end up realizing we are part of a movement and we need to be heard and that we do matter -- and that the people, they needed a voice and we want to be the voice,\" Ashley Carr said. \"That helped me show that I'm OK. ... These are valid feelings to be feeling angry, to be feeling upset, to be feeling like, How in the world could this happen to somebody who was just literally at home?\"\nAmber Carr texts with Botham Jean's mother, Allison, periodically. She's hilarious and \"a breath of fresh air,\" Carr said. Taking Zion and Zayden to visit her in St. Lucia is on Amber Carr's \"vision board\" for the future, she said.\n\"Those women, they're relatable,\" she said. \"That part helps me, to know I'm not by myself.\"\nWaiting for justice\nAs the A-Team grapples with grief and justice, former Fort Worth police officer Aaron Dean awaits trial on a murder charge.\nYolanda Carr sobbed from her hospital bed upon learning Dean was indicted in December, but she died weeks later.\nVictim's brother gets emotional, demands cop's arrest 02:10\nDean had tendered his resignation and has been free on $200,000 bail. The state police union will help pay for his defense. Dean's attorney, Jim Lane, declined to comment, citing the court's gag order, but told CNN last year, \"My client is sorry and his family is in shock.\"\nJefferson's siblings don't know much about the case. No one has given them a timeline. When Amber Carr last spoke to prosecutors, she said, she was told there are other cases ahead of theirs.\n\"We just have to wait our turn,\" Carr said. Because of Covid-19, the state has placed trials on hold until at least September 1, and no information on Dean's trial or next hearing is available, said Sam Jordan, spokeswoman for the Tarrant County district attorney's office.\nThe question the siblings keep asking: Why is this dragging out? It's so clear-cut, so egregious in their minds, it should be open-and-shut, they say. Where's the accountability?\nOfficer charged with murder after killing woman in her home 01:54\nAshley Carr, a former educator, is a budget analyst for Houston schools. If she were to hurt or upset a child, there'd be questions to answer. Amber Carr is a cosmetologist. If she were accused of cutting a client or being unsanitary, Texas might pull her license. Adarius Carr is a sailor. Every time he pulls the trigger, he has to answer to someone. They feel they're held to stiffer standards than police, they say.\n\"Rules of engagement is big in the military, and I don't see how my rules of engagement are a lot stricter than theirs,\" Adarius Carr said. \"They defend us, so it baffles me.\"\nMemories buoy siblings\nUntil they get answers, they'll keep championing Jefferson's legacy. They find warmth in the memories of their beautiful, smiling sister who would do anything for them.\nAshley and Amber will remember when they flew out to San Diego to see Adarius and saw The O'Jays at the 2018 county fair. Video from the concert shows them laughing and dancing and having a ball.\nJefferson loved her tunes -- all genres, from gospel to metal -- and was a talented musician, earning first chair for clarinets at every school she attended, the siblings said.\nAtatiana, Adarius and Amber Carr pose with \"sister-cousin\" Cerese Fortson In San Diego in 2018.\nAshley Carr will always think fondly of the last show they saw together: Beyonce and Jay-Z during the 2018 On the Run II Tour -- in Beyonce's and Ashley's hometown of Houston, no less. Jefferson had never been to a concert of that scale, her sister said, and Ashley didn't realize Jefferson was such an enthusiastic member of the Beyhive until that day. They had such fun, Ashley looked forward to more shows with her sister.\n\"I was like, 'Man, we're doing this all the time.' In my head, I was like, 'This is going to be my new concert buddy,'\" she said. \"When I listen to Beyonce, I always think of her. I always say, 'We had our moment.' We did have our moment, and I'm going to cherish that moment.\""}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/25/us/police-reform-civilian-oversight-invs/index.html", "headline": "When it comes to policing the police, strong watchdogs are the exception", "published_date": "2020-06-25", "text": "(CNN)The video showed a police officer from Austin, Texas, yanking a Black elementary school teacher out of her car and slamming her to the ground for an alleged speeding violation.\nThe dashboard-cam footage went viral in 2016, and local activists that year demanded the officer be fired. When it didn't happen, Austin police reformers clamored for stronger oversight of the police, and rejoiced when the city unveiled a beefed-up independent watchdog office in 2018.\nWe offer several ways to reach our journalists securely.\nCalled the Office of Police Oversight, the new city department operates independently of the police department and aims to not only hold individual officers accountable, but also make policy recommendations that focus on systemic issues, such as racial profiling. Even so, it hasn't been enough to eliminate the types of incidents that result in allegations of police brutality and racial bias.\nSince the city began revamping its oversight arm in January of 2018, Austin police have tased a Black man on his knees with his hands in the air; fatally shot an unarmed Black man in his car in a parking lot; and fired \"less-lethal\" bean-bag projectiles into the crowd at rallies honoring George Floyd -- sending a 16-year-old Latino boy and a 20-year-old Black college student to the hospital with head injuries, the latter a skull fracture.\n\"There is so much work left to do,\" said Austin City Council member Greg Casar, who is a vocal advocate of stronger police reforms. \"Policy change alone isn't going to solely do the trick. We need a culture change within policing.\"\nA protester in Austin, Texas, is detained during a rally against the death in Minneapolis police custody of George Floyd.\nIn addition to touching off a worldwide movement, the police killing of Floyd in Minneapolis has provoked a flurry of interest in police accountability, which often takes the form of police oversight agencies.\nThe day's biggest stories in 10 minutes or less.\nSign up and get access to videos and weekly student quizzes.\nSign Me Up\nNo, Thanks\nBy subscribing you agree to our\nprivacy policy.\nIn recent weeks, at least a dozen cities have reached out to the National Association for Civilian Oversight of Law Enforcement (NACOLE) to either launch some form of new oversight agency or expand on existing ones, said its director of operations, Liana Perez.\nBut at a time when \"defund the police\" has become a rallying cry for some activists, the notion of an oversight agency holds little appeal for those who want fundamental change.\nDisciplinary record of ex-officer who held Eric Garner in chokehold is finally released\nEven the strongest proponents of the civilian oversight model say it, alone, isn't enough to reform policing in America.\n\"This whole discussion is about policy and culture,\" said Robin Kniech, a City Council member in Denver, whose system of oversight has been praised as a model by experts. \"You can have a great use-of-force policy, but if you have a culture of impunity, it doesn't work.\"\nCraig Futterman, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School, said civilian police watchdogs can -- in theory -- be effective. However, he said, most of them are hamstrung by a lack or shortage of four things: independence from police departments or city hall, transparency, funding and authority.\n\"The answer to me isn't that there is something fundamentally wrong with the premise of civilian oversight,\" he said. \"The problem is, in America we still have not really tried.\"\nWatchdogs are few and their authority runs the gamut\nAbout 165 of the nation's 18,000 police departments are subject to some form of police oversight -- meaning the vast majority of law enforcement agencies across America are left to police themselves, said Perez of NACOLE.\nThey come in a dizzying constellation of formats with varying levels of authority, but in general consist of either appointed volunteers or paid non-law enforcement professionals who are tapped to police the police.\nUsually, the bodies lack the power to impose discipline directly, acting instead as advisory panels for police chiefs, internal police department investigators or city managers. Some of the bigger agencies possess the authority to conduct their own investigations.\nTheir effectiveness -- and power -- runs the gamut.\nIn Los Angeles County, it was the FBI -- not its civilian watchdog -- that was investigating allegations of abuse of jail inmates at the hands of deputies that led to a coverup and criminal convictions of the former sheriff and some of his top officials.\nWant to reform the police? Hire more women\nIn Inglewood -- a city in Los Angeles County with a high rate of violent crime -- the citizen oversight panel's meetings have been canceled each month since June 2018, according to the city website. Emails from CNN asking the committee members about this dynamic were not returned, but a 2016 story in the Los Angeles Times quotes a city official saying the commission has \"no authority\" to \"discuss or oversee or even hear any cases of [or] related to officer involved shootings.\"\nBy contrast, one of the nation's strongest civilian oversight boards is located in the northern half of California -- the Oakland Police Commission.\nThis February, in an extremely rare move, the panel of civilian appointees voted unanimously to fire without cause Oakland's police chief, who had clashed with the commission over police shootings and diversity on the force, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. Their action required mayoral approval, which was granted.\nNYPD officer suspended without pay following 'disturbing apparent chokehold incident'\nBut the commission -- which says it was founded to oversee policies in the wake of \"a sex scandal involving multiple officers with a minor\" in May 2016 -- was dinged in an audit earlier this month for failing to review the department's budget, comply with the state's open meetings law and hire an inspector general, among other things.\nIn response, police commission Chair Regina Jackson said the \"auditor's criticisms fail to account for the full span of the commission's work or the full scope of the commission's authority.\"\nTom Nolan, an associate professor at Emmanuel College in Boston, said Oakland is an outlier.\n\"It's the only city that I'm aware of where it has a police review agency that actually has the authority to terminate the chief for cause, or to recommend to the mayor that the chief be terminated without cause,\" he told CNN.\nProtesters hold banners in support of Eric Garner at Union Square on December 3, 2014, in New York City. Garner died after being put in a chokehold during an alteration with NYPD officers.\nOn the opposite coast, it was New York City's Civilian Complaint Review Board -- not the criminal courts -- that brought discipline to the officer who placed a chokehold on Eric Garner, who died after uttering the words \"I can't breathe,\" wrote the chair of the panel in a 2019 op-ed.\nAlthough no criminal charges were filed against police officer Daniel Pantaleo, the review board -- which has the power to investigate claims of wrongdoing, rather than merely review the investigations of internal affairs -- acted as the prosecutor. Its findings were presented to an administrative judge, who made the recommendation that prompted the NYPD to terminate Pantaleo without pension.\nThe watchdog agency last week released all the prior complaints made against Pantaleo after the New York legislature -- prompted by public outrage over George Floyd's death -- repealed a law that had shielded the disciplinary files of police officers from public disclosure.\nOversight not 'the panacea many expected it to be'\nResearch reveals many police watchdogs remain largely toothless.\nNACOLE recently completed a survey of civilian oversight agencies, including 54 that oversee municipal police departments, and provided the unpublished results to CNN.\nTwenty-four said they didn't have the power to issue subpoenas; for five others, their subpoena power excluded sworn officers.\nOnly two agencies, in Detroit and Chicago, said they had \"the authority to implement or impose\" new or revised police policies.\nTwenty-one agencies said the departments they oversee weren't even required to formally respond to the recommendations they made -- let alone actually make any changes.\nThere's no playbook for the battle between mayors and police right now\nAll but four of the agencies said that their access to information like use of force records, stop or search reports, body camera footage or personnel files \"depends on the cooperation\" of the police department they oversee.\n\"Civilian oversight has not proven to be 'the panacea many expected it to be,'\" wrote Stephen Rushin, a police accountability expert at Loyola University, in a 2017 report for Duke Law School.\nCivilian oversight agencies have also been weakened by police unions.\nIn New Jersey last year, the Newark Fraternal Order of Police won a lawsuit that pulled the fangs out of a civilian review board, stripping it of its subpoena power to investigate complaints against police. The board won an appeal and the matter now is before the state Supreme Court, according to a recent report in the Center for Public Integrity.\nAlso in 2018, in Tennessee, the Nashville Fraternal Order of Police spent $500,000 on TV ads and other campaign activities calling on voters to oppose a charter amendment to form an oversight panel -- a proposal prompted in part by the police killing of two Black men by White officers, according to the Tennessean. Despite the union's efforts, the initiative prevailed.\nWhat could make oversight more effective?\nIn recent years, the civilian board model has been losing ground to an emerging model of oversight that now makes up about a quarter of the nation's oversight agencies, Perez said.\nThese are often referred to as \"auditing\" or \"monitoring\" agencies, and they are composed of paid staff -- not appointed volunteers, Perez said. Many of the staffers are \"monitors\" who are lawyers by trade and report to the city manager.\nThe idea is to set expectations for officers on the front end, to better avoid disasters on the back end.\n\"Back ends don't work without good front ends,\" said Barry Friedman, a law professor and director of the Policing Project at New York University School of Law. \"Policing desperately needs a front end.\"\nTo that point, Denver has emerged as a model for effective police oversight.\nDenver Police advance after firing tear gas canisters during a protest outside the State Capitol over the death of George Floyd, on May 30.\nDenver's Office of the Independent Monitor is a city department with 15 employees -- led by mayoral appointee Nicholas Mitchell -- who weigh in on \"back end\" discipline cases and \"front end\" matters of policy. In late 2013, Mitchell, who like many of his employees is an attorney, uncovered a large backlog of civilian complaints in the sheriff's department that included accusations by jail inmates that they'd been physically, sexually or verbally abused by deputies.\nKniech, the Denver City Council member, said this led to a series of reviews that culminated with a major structural change: removing the sheriff's internal review arm and reestablishing it as an independent entity.\n\"Internal affairs are no longer internal,\" said Kniech.\nColorado governor signs bill mandating police body cameras and banning chokeholds\nThe union representing sheriff's deputies told the Denver Post they believed the new division would just add unnecessary layers of bureaucracy.\n\"We're just very disappointed in how this is going,\" Mike Jackson, president of the union, told the newspaper.\nDenver's robust watchdog apparatus hasn't been enough to change some of the more deeply rooted problems.\n\"We have not overcome the institutionalized racism that lives in individual officers and in the system,\" Kniech said.\nPolice unions stand in the way of lasting reform\nKniech cited the 2015 case of Jessica \"Jessie\" Hernandez, age 17, who was sleeping in a car that was suspected stolen with four other teens. When police arrived and got out of their cars to talk to the teens, Hernandez, who was behind the wheel, started driving away. Officers fired four shots into the driver's side window of the car, killing Hernandez.\n\"Rather than jumping out of the way of the car, the officer shot into the car\" and killed Hernandez, she said.\nThe officers involved with the incident were cleared of criminal wrongdoing by the DA; the officer who shot into the car said he feared for his safety.\nHernandez's parents later sued the city, which paid the family $1 million in a settlement.\nDespite improvements, there's still more work to do in Austin\nAustin city officials boast that their new office of oversight is the strongest in Texas. But while it, like Denver, uses the monitoring and auditing approach, unlike Denver, Austin's office lacks subpoena power.\nIt has, however, been credited for its transparency.\nWhy some police officers rally around their colleagues -- even when they're accused of committing crimes\nNew rules enable citizens to file complaints anonymously and easily -- by a phone call, for instance. Each complaint is prominently posted online, with the accused officer's name redacted.\nComplaints have skyrocketed. The George Floyd protest alone, in which Austin police fired \"less-lethal\" beanbag rounds into the crowd, generated more than 200, according to Farah Muscadin, head of Austin's police oversight agency.\nAustin Police Chief Brian Manley said in a Twitter post that officers on one occasion fired into the crowd after a demonstrator hurled a water bottle and bag at the police. He acknowledged that police accidentally hit another man, Justin Howell, a 20-year-old college student who suffered a skull fracture when a beanbag projectile hit the back of his head.\nChas Moore, a local activist who spearheaded the drive for revamping the oversight office, said the resulting reform, to date, has been \"very, very, very incremental.\"\n\"The APD has a very long way of going before they begin to regain trust in the communities that they harm the most, which is Black and other communities of color,\" he said.\nIn December, Austin City Council voted unanimously to conduct an audit of the department for racism and bigotry.\nCalls are growing to defund police in the US. Here are some lessons from overseas\nChief Manley, who did not respond to a CNN request for comment, has defended the department against such accusations.\nEarlier this month, the City Council grilled him about whether the police response to the Floyd protest is a sign the department is in need of \"institutional reform,\" with one member pointing out that the police didn't fire \"less lethal\" munitions on people protesting the coronavirus shutdown.\n\"I don't believe that the occurrences of this weekend should lead people to believe automatically that there's a culture problem,\" he said, according to the local NPR affiliate.\nTo date, few of the complaints involving excessive use-of-force allegations have resulted in disciplinary action since the oversight office's official launch in late 2018, said Muscadin, adding that she and the policing community typically don't see eye-to-eye on use-of-force matters.\nSenate Democrats block GOP police reform bill, throwing overhaul effort into flux\n\"We will watch the same video and see two different things,\" said Muscadin, an attorney who, prior to relocating to Austin from Chicago for the position, worked as an assistant public defender for the Cook County Public Defender's Office.\nThe office also released a racial profiling report showing that Austin police disproportionately pull over black motorists, who make up 8% of the population but constitute 15% of the stops. Muscadin has recommended a racial-profiling policy for the department, as well as a mandatory class on the history of race and policing.\nAustin's most high-profile open case involves the fatal police shooting in April of Michael Ramos, an unarmed Black man.\nThe oversight office and the police department are squabbling over how to release the body-cam footage, which shows Ramos getting back into his car in a parking lot of his apartment complex after being shot with a beanbag round. When he pulls the car forward, an officer fires live rounds into it, killing Ramos. The officer believed the vehicle at that point was a weapon, police said.\nIn late May -- a few days after Floyd's death -- the district attorney announced that she would present the Ramos case to a grand jury.\nLast summer, the same officer who killed Ramos -- Christopher Taylor -- was one of the officers involved in the fatal shooting of 46-year-old Mauris DeSilva, who had reportedly been holding a knife to his own throat in his apartment building. Police said DeSilva was experiencing a mental health crisis, and that he walked toward officers while still clutching the knife.\nThe case touched off an internal investigation, but nearly one year after the incident, all the evidence -- including the body-cam footage -- remains sealed from the public amid a civil lawsuit pitting DeSilva's family against the city. (A police spokesperson told CNN the state attorney general has ordered the city to withhold the evidence pending the outcome of the district attorney's review of the case.)\nKen Casaday, president of the Austin Police Association, said Taylor and the other officer \"followed their training\" with respect to the DeSilva case.\n\"That's all we expect,\" he told CNN, saying he is withholding judgment in Ramos case because the investigation is ongoing.\nMeanwhile, Ramos's mother, Brenda Ramos, who has demanded that the officer who killed her son be held accountable, continues to wait.\n\"I just miss him so much,\" she said in a phone interview. \"I'm hurting more and more, because that officer is working on the street after what he's done.\""}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/17/us/brooklyn-molotov-lawyers-protests/index.html", "headline": "How two promising lawyers found themselves facing life in prison for alleged Molotov cocktail attack during protests in NY", "published_date": "2020-06-17", "text": "New York (CNN)On an early October evening in 2014, a group of New York University law school students gathered for a joint birthday party at (Le) Poisson Rouge, a popular bar and music venue a few blocks from campus.\nOne of the birthday celebrants, Colinford Mattis, quickly hit it off with another guest, Urooj Rahman, who was studying law at Fordham. Both raised in Brooklyn, the two bonded over their professional interest in human rights and their engagement in local politics, becoming friends from there on.\nToday, Mattis, 32, and Rahman, 31, are in jail, facing federal charges alleging they participated in a Molotov cocktail attack on an empty New York Police Department vehicle during protests sparked by the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.\nThe promising young lawyers with enviable educational pedigrees and significant familial responsibilities -- he is raising three foster children; she is the primary caretaker for her elderly mother -- suddenly find themselves detainees indicted on seven federal felony charges for which they face life in prison. Their predicament has puzzled not only family and friends, but also prosecutors themselves.\n\"He's a person with an extraordinary career that was just starting in the law. He attended prestigious universities, he had some of the best education that you can have in this country and yet he risked everything -- everything -- to drive around in a car with Molotov cocktails attacking police vehicles,\" federal prosecutor Ian Richardson said during one of Mattis's initial court appearances.\n\"It is difficult for me, frankly,\" Richardson later added, \"to comprehend how somebody in his position with his background would do what he did.\"\nThe day's biggest stories in 10 minutes or less.\nSign up and get access to videos and weekly student quizzes.\nSign Me Up\nNo, Thanks\nBy subscribing you agree to our\nprivacy policy.\nA former colleague of Rahman's, Alicia Bella, said she couldn't reconcile the charges with the person she knew. \"I'm very surprised. My heart goes out to her, and I want to do everything I can to help her,\" she said. \"I know what this country does to people who express themselves. I'm definitely worried.\"\nProsecutors say the two lawyers drove Mattis's tan minivan late in the evening of May 29 to participate in widespread protests in Brooklyn's Fort Greene neighborhood. There, just before 1 a.m. on May 30, Rahman approached an empty NYPD vehicle with an already broken window and tossed in a makeshift explosive device, according to court filings. She also \"attempted to distribute Molotov cocktails to several other individuals and to incite them to use the Molotov cocktails in the course of the protests.\"\nThe van, driven by Mattis, then \"fled the scene,\" court documents say, and shortly thereafter police stopped the vehicle and found \"precursor items\" to build explosives, including a lighter, a Bud Light bottle stuffed with toilet paper and a gasoline tank. Both Mattis and Rahman have been indicted on charges including use of explosives, arson and civil disorder. They haven't entered a plea.\nThough the alleged actions of the two did not cause physical harm to any individual, their behavior, as described by prosecutors, came at the height of both the protests that swept the city and an eruption of destructive looting and property damage that sparked days of tension between police and those who had taken to the streets.\nBy all accounts, their alleged actions stand in contrast to their nature.\nAccording to their friends and lawyers and a review of their professional experiences and personal lives, Mattis and Rahman are lifelong social justice advocates with deep interests in civil rights and police reform, but neither displayed signs that they might engage in the sort of violent outburst of which they are accused.\n'He always wanted to use a law degree to do good in this world'\nMattis was raised and attended public school in East New York, a section of Brooklyn that has among the highest crime rates and lowest-performing schools in the city, according to public records.\nHe went on to attend St. Andrew's School, a prestigious private institution in Middletown, Delaware, where he published an essay for the school magazine that signaled his nascent interest in social and economic justice issues.\nHe wrote that, inspired by his colonial history class and the Kanye West song \"Diamonds from Sierra Leone,\" he had organized a forum on the trade of blood diamonds.\n\"As I researched the brutality of mining diamonds and lack of compensation, I was reminded of my time working at a fair trade coffee cooperative in Mexico over the summer,\" he wrote. \"There I learned the values of fair trade, and met the people who make an inexpensive commodity that Americans just consume. I realized that just because America is a capitalist society, success does not need to ultimately be 'someone loses and someone wins,' but rather everyone can win and have enough to live comfortably.\"\nAt Princeton University, where Mattis studied sociology and played rugby, he appears to have amassed a dedicated group of friends.\nDuring an early teleconference in his court case, his attorney, Sabrina Shroff, told the judge that \"almost all of the colleagues that he had at Princeton are either on this line, have called me or e-mailed me or offered to support him in one way or another.\"\nShe added: \"I could not overemphasize here the level of support that Colin has received from the Princeton community.\" Reached by CNN, she declined to comment for this story, though she told the court in a filing Tuesday that the alleged conduct outlined in the charges is \"highly aberrational.\" Of the suggestion Mattis would be involved in violent acts, she wrote, \"he is no such person.\"\nAfter two years teaching math and science in New Orleans as part of Teach for America, Mattis returned to New York City to attend law school, where he struck classmates as unaffected by the trappings of the institutions he had attended.\n\"I think it's very easy in that kind of setting to get wrapped up in the doctrine of the law and in grades, and he always wanted to use a law degree to do good in this world,\" said Olivia Ensign, a friend of his from law school who remains in close contact with him.\nTo Mattis, she said, that meant \"that it's not enough to really have access to these places of power and privilege, that you need to bring in other people and make sure that anything you do is with a sense of community and bringing down structural inequality.\"\nWhen he ran for social chair of the law school's student bar association, he described himself in his campaign pitch as \"pretty chill & super friendly + I like dopeness.\" He suggested that as chair he would push for food at events, puppies at dog therapy, \"and whatever fresh ideas y'all have.\"\nWhen he campaigned the next year to continue on as a third-year representative, Mattis advocated a plan for free or subsidized coffee on campus and to \"strengthen our intellectual community as a space for open and sincere discourse around legal and societal issues that matter.\"\n\"A vote for me is a vote for more awesome at NYU Law!\" he wrote.\nHe did corporate work at the law firm Holland & Knight after graduating, while volunteering for a group called Her Justice, which provides lawyers for women living in poverty. There, Mattis and another lawyer won an award for their advocacy for a mother seeking financial support for her young daughter, according to the group's website.\nSome law enforcement officers at protests have no badges and some have covered them. City officials say that is unacceptable\nMore recently, he worked at mid-size law firm Pryor Cashman LLP in its corporate practice group and was a member of the local community board in his childhood neighborhood of East New York, where he returned to live with his mother.\nHe was furloughed from the firm in April, amid the coronavirus pandemic, and after his arrest, the firm placed him on suspension without pay.\n\"As we confront critical issues around historic and ongoing racism and inequity in our society, I am saddened to see this young man allegedly involved in the worst kind of reaction to our shared outrage over what had occurred,\" the firm's managing partner, Ronald H. Shechtman, said in a statement at the time of Mattis's arrest.\nDuring his employment at Pryor Cashman, Mattis's home life took a turn, according to his lawyer and friends. His mother fell ill of uterine cancer while caring for three foster children. Last year, Mattis's mother died, and he assumed full-time care of the children, ages 5, 7 and 11, moving forward on the adoption process for two of them, with plans to do so for the third, according to his lawyer.\nA friend of both Mattis and Rahman, Salmah Rizvi, recalled him as unfazed by the daunting task of suddenly caring for three children on his own.\n\"He was inspired by this new responsibility and he felt that it really helped him to manage his time,\" she said, adding that he attended all of their parent-teacher conferences. \"He felt it was nothing but a blessing. Never ever did he use the word 'stress.'\"\n'Everything she did was to help underprivileged people'\nRahman cut a similar path. A Pakistani immigrant, she arrived in Brooklyn at age 4 with her mother to meet her father, who was already living in the US. Rahman grew up in Bay Ridge, where she attended public school and then gained entry to Brooklyn Technical High School, a specialized school that is one of the most competitive in New York City. Next came Fordham University.\nIn law school, also at Fordham, she became deeply interested in refugee rights and international human rights, winning a fellowship to work as a lawyer in Turkey, where she helped asylum-seekers in Istanbul, and then did similar work in Cairo for a group called Saint Andrew's Refugee Services, according to her lawyer.\nAs demand for police reform grows, military equipment program faces new scrutiny\nWhen she returned to New York, she got involved in local politics, becoming policy director for a longshot 2017 mayoral campaign by Robert Gangi, an activist and police reform advocate whose central campaign proposal was to eliminate \"broken windows\" policing in New York.\nThe eradication of that practice, which holds that issuing summonses and making arrests for minor offenses helps ward off more serious crimes, was important to Rahman, recalled Bella, one of Gangi's campaign managers.\nBella said Rahman kept their team organized, but rather than being a taskmaster, took on extra work herself if it needed to be done.\n\"I was talking to a few of our colleagues about everything and we were saying, when I forget how to keep going in politics, I think of Urooj. She was the reason why I felt like I could make a difference and my voice mattered,\" Bella said. \"Everything she did was to help underprivileged people.\"\nRahman's professional interests, however, belie the more casual side of a young woman who loves Cardi B, the New York Yankees and Bollywood dancing, her friends said.\nRizvi, the mutual friend of Rahman and Mattis, said Rahman helped choreograph dances for a ceremony the night before Rizvi's wedding, and often assists her in the kitchen.\n\"I like to cook, and she's always willing to cut my onions for me so I don't have to cry.\"\nPrior to her detainment, Rahman had been working for Bronx Legal Services, where she fought evictions for impoverished tenants in housing court, and was responsible for caring for her mother, who is in declining health, doing her grocery shopping and getting her medications.\nAt an early court hearing, a lawyer for Rahman noted that the care she provided for her mother was so extensive that she draws a stipend from a home health care organization.\nNow, however, Rahman may face a bleak outlook. As a prosecutor put it in court: \"She has thrown away her career in the law when she threw that Molotov cocktail at a New York City Police Department vehicle.\"\nSince the protests, video that appears to include an interview with Rahman taken the evening of the alleged incident has surfaced online.\nPosted to YouTube by a group called Loudlabs News NYC, the video shows a woman who gives her name as \"Urooj\" and who wears the same outfit in which Rahman was photographed that evening.\n\"This has got to stop, and the only way they hear us is through violence, through the means that they use,\" she says. \"Gotta use the master's tools, that's what my friend always says.\"\nShe continues: \"What I saw was targeting of property, and no property is above a human life. Destruction of property is nothing compared to the murder of a human life. So I understand why people are doing it. It's a way to show their pain, their anger, because it just never stops.\"\nHer lawyer, Paul Shechtman, said the conduct laid out in the charges, if believed, was \"an aberrant act in the heat of the civil protests that have swept the country over police violence and systemic racism. Viewed in the context of her life, violence is clearly not Ms. Rahman's way.\"\nThough Rahman and Mattis were initially granted bail by a US District Court judge, an appeals court ordered that they be detained while Brooklyn federal prosecutors appeal the bail decision. Since last week, the two have been incarcerated at the Metropolitan Detention Center.\nRahman's lawyer disclosed in a court filing Tuesday arguing against her detention that she is being \"held in isolation (in quarantine) for two weeks,\" adding that \"to believe that Ms. Rahman will turn to violence if released to home detention -- and thereby risk substantial harm to herself and to family and friends -- is to substitute fiction for reason.\"\nIn an unusual step, a group of 56 former federal prosecutors also submitted a proposed brief to the court Tuesday to argue that federal prosecutors in the Rahman and Mattis case have misconstrued the bail laws and that the defendants have been wrongly jailed.\nMeanwhile, their detention has alarmed their friends.\n\"They're just amazing people,\" said Rizvi. \"They're really kind-hearted and they do not deserve to be in jail right now. They are not a threat.\"\nCorrection: A previous version of this story had the incorrect name of the school Mattis attended.

Somehow the notion was that if you cut a police budget, you were soft on crime,\" said New York City's Comptroller, Scott Stringer, who submitted a proposal for reducing the police department budget but is not involved in passing it. \"Now, people want a different kind of budgeting and a different kind of governing.\"\nCalls are growing to defund police in the US. Here are some lessons from overseas\nMaria Haberfeld, a professor of police science at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, said nearly 90% of police department budgets go to paying personnel, including salaries and overtime. The rest of the money covers other expenses such as equipment and training.\nDrastic budget cuts would affect every facet of policing in America, Haberfeld said.\n\"With crime increasing you cannot afford to dilute the deployment,\" she said. \"There'll be cuts to overtime. Investigations will suffer. Response times will suffer \u2014 everything we ask the police to improve in terms of response time, in terms of clearing investigations and finding people responsible for various crimes.\"\nAlex Vitale, coordinator of the Policing and Social Justice Project at Brooklyn College and author of \"The End of Policing,\" said the calls for change stem from decades of \"gross over reliance on policing\" in the country.\n\"This is really a reaction to 40 years of American politicians turning every social problem under the sun, especially in low income and communities of color, over to the police to manage,\" he told CNN. \"And people are demanding that we find better solutions.\"\nThere are calls for $1 billion NYPD budget cut\nThe case for defunding the police 18:21\nAs protesters cried out to \"defund the NYPD\" while marching through the city's streets, advocates and city leaders considered which parts of the department's nearly $6 billion budget could go.\n\"The NYPD budget is incredibly opaque. It's the most secretive budget in the entire city,\" said Joo-Hyun Kang, director of Communities United for Police Reform, an advocacy group that proposed a $1 billion cut from NYPD's budget for the 2021 fiscal year.\nWhen it comes to policing the police, strong watchdogs are the exception\nOne of the most draconian measures proposed by the group is a hiring freeze, which would save $263 million in fiscal year 2021, according to the plan. It would also reduce the number of uniformed officers by taking officers out of schools, firing about 220 officers who are on modified duty and accused of misconduct, and removing officers from \"non-police\" enforcement roles including homeless outreach, mental health response and transportation.\n\"Cutting at least a billion dollars from the NYPD is the floor not the ceiling of what should be done,\" Kang said. \"NYPD's budget has been allowed to balloon and has been politically protected for years ...\"\nIn a statement, the NYPD cautioned there will be consequences of such a hit to its budget.\n\"Depleting NYPD personnel by several thousand police officers, at a time of increasing violence, would harm New Yorkers \u2014 particularly the communities most in need of public safety. While we support the shifting of some services to other city agencies to achieve the kind of real savings that are necessary now, significant budget cuts threaten to erode our shared successes, our continued reforms and the quality of service New Yorkers expect and deserve.\"\nThere's a growing call to defund the police. Here's what it means\nStringer, whose office focuses on city spending and how to make it run more efficiently, has a more modest proposal that would still cut $265 million from NYPD's budget each year over the next four years, for a total of nearly $1.1 billion.\nThe biggest cuts under Stringer's proposal would be to the department's 36,000 uniformed officers. He suggests cutting through an estimated 3% attrition rate. Those cuts, plus other \"fringe savings,\" would save the city $223 million for the year.\n\"Defund is not just about taking money from one agency to another. Defund is also about investment to fight systemic racism,\" Stringer said. \"A budget is as much a moral document as a financial one. It lays out the aspirations of a city. You put a price tag on those aspirations. I would like money directed at communities that need it the most.\"\nA push is on to fund youth and social services\nNYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea told CNN earlier this month he views shifting police funds to help youths as separate from the \"defund\" movement.\nNYPD commissioner testifies in ongoing investigation into interactions between police and the public\n\"Look at the fiscal crisis that we're about to be met by -- everyone is going to have to tighten their belts, including the NYPD,\" Shea said. \"I absolutely do commit to taking some money out of the NYPD budget if it can be used to restore programs for kids. I think that's crime fighting. I think it's crime fighting in a different way.\"\nNew York City is already struggling financially because of tax revenue shortfalls due to the pandemic.\nCrime rates, meanwhile, have spiked.\nNYPD statistics show the city's murder rate is up over 18%, over the first five months of the year compared to last year. Overall, shooting incidents are also up over 18% for the year as compared to last year, statistics show.\n\"It's a combination of things,\" said NYPD Chief of Department Terrance Monahan in an exclusive interview with CNN. \"More people not in jail. Rikers Island (jail) in New York is empty. Between Covid, between bail reform, the protest caused animosity towards the police, which took us out of neighborhoods that needed us the most.\"\nMayor Bill de Blasio has said he supports cutting money from the NYPD budget to shift toward youth and social services and is in closed-door negotiations with the City Council.\n\"I'm very hopeful that we'll get to a positive outcome with the Council, a major shift of funds from the NYPD to youth services and other community needs,\" de Blasio said on Friday.\nHouse approves police reform bill named in honor of George Floyd\nWhile de Blasio has said he does not support cutting $1 billion from the police budget, New York City Council Speaker Corey Johnson said Thursday the council is pushing the mayor to consider slashing more. He and other council members called for $1 billion in cuts to the NYPD's budget for next year.\n\"We have been negotiating, we have been pushing, we have been prodding, we have been telling them every single day that the number needs to be a bigger number,\" Johnson said.\nThe speaker said he was \"incredibly concerned\" about increasing crime rates.\n\"And we want to make sure that we are effectively dealing with those issues, but we don't think that the traditional methods of policing are the only things that work,\" Johnson said.\nPolice advocates argue that cutting uniformed officers at a time of spiking crime rates is a recipe for disaster.\nPolice Benevolent Association President Pat Lynch said, for decades, city agencies that failed at their tasks had those jobs taken away and given to the police.\n\"If the City Council wants to give responsibilities back to those failing agencies, that's their choice,\" Lynch said in a June 12 statement. \"But they will bear the blame for every new victim, for every New Yorker in need of help who falls through the cracks. They won't be able to throw cops under the bus anymore.\"\nThe NYPD said 272 uniformed officers have filed for retirement between May 25 and June 23 \u2014 which Lynch attributed to cops being at their \"breaking point.\" Last year, 183 officers had filed for retirement during that period.\n\"We are all asking the same question: How can we keep doing our job in this environment?\" he said in a statement.\nMinneapolis has been the most aggressive\nMinneapolis has taken the most dramatic steps, essentially declaring its police department beyond reform.\nThe City Council on Friday officially moved to dismantle its police force and replace it with a department of community safety and violence prevention in the wake of the police killing of Floyd in that city.\nFour weeks after George Floyd's death, an embattled police union finally speaks out\nThe unanimous vote approving a proposed charter amendment represents a first step in a complicated process that includes a review by a public commission before the measure could ultimately end up in the hands of voters at the November ballot.\nThe proposed change to the charter also faces a review by a council policy and oversight committee next month.
