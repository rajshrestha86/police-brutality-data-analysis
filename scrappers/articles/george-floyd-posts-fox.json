Her remarks also came amid efforts by Democrats to pin the blame on outside white supremacist agitators, even though data suggests the vast majority of arrested protesters in recent days are local.\n\"To designate Antifa a terrorist organization, fine, but let's also focus on the right-wing terrorist organizations,\" Rice told CNN's Wolf Blitzer, referring to President Trump's decision earlier in the day to brand the left-wing militant group as a terrorist organization. \"The white supremacists that he's called, in the past, very fine people.\"\nRice's claim that Trump praised white supremacists has been debunked.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, for example, said Saturday that officials thought \"white supremacists\" and \"out-of-state instigators\" could be behind the protests in the wake of Floyd's death, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz also claimed most of the protesters arrested were from outside Minneapolis and sought to take advantage of the chaos.\n\"We are now confronting white supremacists, members of organized crime, out of state instigators, and possibly even foreign actors to destroy and destabilize our city and our region,\" Frey had tweeted Saturday.\nBIG-CITY DEMS LET PROTESTERS FLOUT CORONAVIRUS LOCKDOWNS\nHowever, a report by KARE 11 showed \"about 86 percent\" of the 36 arrests listed their address in Minnesota, and that they live in Minneapolis or the metro area, according to data the outlet analyzed from the Hennepin County Jail's roster. Five out-of-state cases came from Arkansas, Florida, Illinois, Michigan and Missouri.\nSt. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter later admitted he was wrong when he falsely claimed that \"every person\" arrested in Minneapolis protests was from out of state.

Whoever, whether or not acting under color of law, willfully causes bodily injury to any person or, through the use of fire, a firearm, a dangerous weapon, or an explosive or incendiary device, attempts to cause bodily injury to any person, because of the actual or perceived race, color, religion or national origin of any person.\"\nVideo\nAdditionally, any offense committed against an individual because of actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or disability is also a hate crime.\nDespite the mainstream media\u2019s attempt to spin when it comes to police brutality and hate crimes perpetrated against unarmed black men, the truth may not be what you expect.\nFrom Trayvon Martin to Freddie Gray to Michael Brown to Eric Gardner to Alton Sterling, no rogue cop or racially motivated citizen\u2019s arrest was ever charged with a hate crime under the Obama administration\u2019s Department of Justice.\nAs shocking as all of this may sound to folks like Ice Cube and others, President Donald J.

Around one-third of those arrested were women.\nMeanwhile, in New York, it is believed that the groups have operated using encrypted communications and seek external funding for bail money. One source connected to the NYPD pointed out that political and celebrity vows to bail out those arrested across the country have inflamed the situation and further emboldened the violence.\nMoreover, rumors were being stirred up across social media to conjure up fear and anxiety in communities even in far-reaching counties such as Suffolk County in Long Island, a common terrorist tactic, the police source said, adding that federal and local police, in recent days, have infiltrated the various rioting clusters to ascertain further information below the radar.\n\"But, those doing the damage are from all walks of life, kids to educated adults. Some come in groups, and some come alone,\" the official continued.\nOne known Antifa offshoot in New York, as investigated by Fox News, came together for planning meetings regarding various social causes in early 2019 and was comprised mainly of university students, local writers and artists, some former U.S. military members and minority groups passionate about multiple causes ranging from LGBTQ rights and Palestinian rights to Native American and immigration issues. Ready-made \"F-- the Police\" signs stood at the ready whenever needed, and a few of the most vocal in the group typically advised newcomers on how to deal with such things as tear gas or police pushback.\nThe effort was led primarily by a university professor and self-proclaimed human rights activist with extensive experience in protest movements. Little vetting was done on those who joined the group, but when it came to discussing anything potentially criminal, all discussion went underground.\nIn Chicago, Mayor Lori Lightfoot has stressed that \"there clearly was coordination\" among the looting faction and that \"they were clearly listening to our radio traffic.\"\n\"The number of U-Haul trucks that magically showed up in front of stores, car caravans that dropped people off and broke windows, and they were hustling the goods out into the backs of the cars,\" she added. \"Absolutely, it was organized \u2013 there's no question whatsoever about that.\"\nWeapons recovered in Minneapolis after a weekend of riots.

He said Sunday that law enforcement was cognizant of their presence on the ground, but it remained unclear how many there were and if they belonged to a specific outfit.\nIan Bradbury, the president of Terra Nova Strategic Management, a Canadian advisory and strategy firm that has enabled the counter-violent-extremism sector to better resolve complex challenges, said that the most observable of those committing violence and riot behavior included local street gangs, local and out-of-state anarchists and Antifa groupings \u2013 using black bloc tactics centered on vandalism of public property and rioting \u2013 as well as unassociated individuals.\n\"Some far-right elements have been observed acting as provocateurs, but with only minor observable representation thus far in comparison to other actors. Should the destabilizing conditions continue, these observations may shift as more interests become involved,\" he asserted.\nAs for just how \"outside\" the rioters were, those on the ground contend it's been a mixed bag of locals as well as opportunists from rural areas and neighboring states. Several sources interviewed by Fox News indicated that there was little to prove an overwhelming outside presence, as most arrests in cities seemingly were those living in and around the area.\nThe aftermath of riots Friday in Minneapolis. (Brian Peterson/Star Tribune via AP)\nBut in the case of Detroit, as per Mayor Mike Duggan, many have traveled from out-of-state to contribute to the calamity. On Friday, he claimed 65 percent of those arrested were from outside the Detroit area and even well beyond Michigan's borders. That number jumped to 75 percent on Saturday night.\nAnd, as Boyd pointed out, many of those arrested this weekend in Boston stemmed from outside the urban hub and were from New Hampshire, Vermont and rural pockets of Massachusetts.\nOfficials also were rushing to develop a clearer picture of the involvement of foreign actors and cyber instigators in the calamity, both in pushing narratives and as propaganda victories.\n\"Chinese propaganda has been quick to label the American government as incompetent as the U.S. deals with an intricate network of interstate activists using technology to exploit revolutionary lessons learned since Ferguson, and perfected in places like Portland, Oregon, against unprepared communities across America,\" global-risk analyst Dennis Santiago conjectured. \"The Chinese clearly remain worried that their mishandling of the novel coronavirus outbreak will have severe repercussions from the global community as post-COVID-19 re-opening and realignment of supply chain dependencies plays out.\"\nHe also highlighted the role cyber has played in adding fuel to the fire.\n\"Social-media engines have had to contend with a new series of both artificial intelligence and expert-system robotic attacks from abroad in recent times, particularly pushing the Chinese narrative that the U.S. is an incompetent government,\" he said. \"Born out of worry about the novel coronavirus, the extent to which it has was a contributor to domestic U.S. events remains to be seen. There are other... robotic-narrative campaigns sourced within the U.S. that are equally powerful. This is still an election year, and the presidential election is divisive.\"\nExperts largely have concurred that the extended lockdown to squash the spread of the coronavirus, or COVID-19, created something of a \"perfect storm\" that thousands of looters have been able to exploit \u2013 either driven by pent-up frustration or loss of income.\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\nBut, with mass riots and little in the way of \"social distancing,\" some analysts feared the worst was still to come.\n\"The riots have underplayed the COVID-19 threat,\" Schiena added. \"We are potentially facing disastrous consequences with a potential severe spike in cases, forcing an extended lockdown which would damage the U.S. economy even further.\""}, {"url": "https://www.foxnews.com/media/cnn-headquarters-atlanta-vandalized-protesters-george-floyd-death", "headline": "CNN headquarters in Atlanta vandalized by protesters after George Floyd death", "published_date": "2020-05-29", "text": "Protesters gather outside CNN headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia\nProtesters reportedly have smashed windows of CNN building.\nA protest erupted outside CNN's headquarters in Atlanta on Friday amid nationwide demonstrations following the death of Minneapolis man George Floyd, with many of the protesters seen vandalizing the entrance of the building in videos posted to social media.\nA crowd gathered in front of the CNN Center and grew over the course of several hours, initially breaking windows and spray-painting the CNN sign, and later throwing objects -- including what appeared to be a firecracker that exploded -- and reportedly shooting BB guns into the lobby.\nThe iconic CNN sign, a popular tourist destination in the downtown area, was covered with graffiti and others were seen jumping on top of the structure.\nA CNN journalist captured footage of a window being shattered by the crowd, which can be heard sparking cheers.\nLaw enforcement eventually cleared the area, pushing the crowd further down the street.\nCNN REPORTER, CREW FREED AFTER BEING ARRESTED WHILE COVERING GEORGE FLOYD PROTESTS\nReporting from CNN correspondent Nick Valencia showed multiple police cars that were set ablaze and Georgia State Police entering the scene.\n\"This is terrible to witness, it's terrible to witness,\" Valencia told CNN anchor Anderson Cooper.\nValencia later reported live from the lobby of the CNN Center, where police officers were seen lined up inside the headquarters guarding the entrance.

According to the FBI, for example, an estimated 16,214 people were murdered in the United States in 2018. If we had fewer police on our streets that tragic figure would be higher. And you can bet that criminals would commit more robberies, assaults, rapes, burglaries and other crimes as well if there was a smaller police presence on the streets.\nWe need police to continue to fulfill their vital function of protecting the innocent and holding lawbreakers accountable.\nAnd so, anyone who cares about America should proclaim from the rooftops that \u201cdefunding the police\u201d would produce terribly dangerous consequences.\nPolice officers in the United States risk their lives to serve and protect their fellow citizens. The overwhelming majority of officers are outstanding public servants who each day perform their difficult duties for all the right reasons.\nThis defunding makes as much sense as cutting funding for a hospital or a school where a doctor or teacher has engaged in criminal conduct against a patient or student.\nCertainly, there are individual cops unworthy of the badges they wear, whether due to corruption, incompetence or hot tempers that get out of control. A small number of officers hired to fight crime turn into criminals themselves, violating the rights of citizens, engaging in police brutality, and \u2013 on rare occasions \u2013 even killing innocent people of all races.\nBut the solution to this problem lies in specifically identifying the officers acting improperly within police agencies \u2013 and removing those who are incorrigible. Further, when whole departments show systematic patterns of improper behavior, wholesale leadership changes must be made\nThe truth is that a small number of people in every profession engage in criminal conduct. We\u2019ve all seen news stories about pedophile priests, doctors who rape patients, teachers who assault students, lawyers who swindle elderly clients out of their life savings, corrupt politicians who take bribes, and more. In all these professions, wrongdoers must be identified and removed from their positions \u2013 and imprisoned if convicted of crimes.\nIn the slow and excruciating death of George Floyd, our nation witnessed just how horrific a situation can become when bad cops walk the street. Fortunately, justice now appears to be moving swiftly in that Minneapolis case.\nDefunding police departments, however, would only make positive reforms all the more difficult to achieve. In a troubling move, for example, the mayor of Los Angeles has proposed cutting as much as $150 million from funding for the city\u2019s police department.\nThis defunding makes as much sense as cutting funding for a hospital or a school where a doctor or teacher has engaged in criminal conduct against a patient or student. In all these cases, the criminal cops, doctors and teachers would not be the ones to suffer as a result of defunding. Hospital patients, students and the general public would suffer instead.\nWhen our communities hire police officers, we ask them to risk their lives to keep our families and neighborhoods safe. According to the FBI, 89 officers were killed around the nation in the line of duty in 2019. These deaths were a tragedy that should not be ignored.\nThe least we can do for our police officers is to ensure they have the best possible training and equipment \u2013 and enough funding for adequate staffing.\nYears before he became president, Teddy Roosevelt served as New York City\u2019s police commissioner. In his autobiography, he wrote about his longstanding commitment to adequately fund police departments. \u201cI have not the slightest sympathy,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwith any policy which tends to put the policeman at the mercy of a tough [criminal], or which deprives him of efficient weapons.\u201d\nWith the turmoil and strife that have wracked our nation following the killing of George Floyd, perhaps it\u2019s understandable that many people are acting and reacting out of emotion rather than logic. But we can do better.\nIt is shameful that a real opportunity to tackle unresolved racial discord is being hijacked by anarchists who want to destabilize our nation.\nFollowing the killing of George Floyd, we have witnessed at least a dozen additional deaths in senseless violent riots.\nOne of these tragedies occurred with the death of David Dorn, age 77, who was killed while trying to protect a friend\u2019s pawnshop from rampaging looters in St. Louis.\nDorn, a black man, was a retired police captain.

No violence was reported in those protests.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe FBI has been called in to aid local police in the investigation into Floyd's death, which immediately drew comparisons to the case of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man who died in 2014 in New York City after he was placed in a chokehold by police and pleaded for his life, heard in another video saying, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d\nPresident Trump said he ordered the FBI and Justice Department to investigate the death.\n\"At my request, the FBI and the Department of Justice are already well into an investigation as to the very sad and tragic death in Minnesota of George Floyd,\" Trump tweeted.\nFox News' Danielle Wallace and the Associated Press contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/nypd-292-officers-injured-floyd-protests", "headline": "NYPD says 292 officers injured during George Floyd protests, as police across US come under siege", "published_date": "2020-06-06", "text": "Hundreds march across Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco protest\nHundreds of protesters march across the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, Claudia Cowan reports.\nNearly 300 New York police officers have been injured amid the ongoing protests following George Floyd's death, Fox News has learned.\nThe 292 figure provided by police gave some initial context to the fallout of how the protests, lasting over a week, have impacted law enforcement -- which has faced threats of violence, defunding and harassment in the streets. Messages like \"F--k the police,\" acab (all cops are b---ards) and descriptions of cops as \"pigs\" have been painted across buildings and monuments in U.S. cities, and held up on protesters' signs.\nThe extent of the 292 injuries is unclear. While the bulk of protests have reportedly been peaceful, U.S. cities have utilized law enforcement to tamp down on the more violent and destructive aspects. The unrest has become so dangerous that President Trump threatened to deploy the armed forces to help police officers and the National Guard.\nPOLICE UNDER SIEGE: ATTACKS ON LAW ENFORCEMENT IN WAKE OF GEORGE FLOYD'S DEATH\nTens of thousands of protesters streamed into the nation\u2019s capital and other major cities Saturday in another huge mobilization against police brutality and racial injustice, while Floyd was remembered in his North Carolina hometown by mourners who waited hours for a glimpse of his golden coffin.\nHighlighting the potential for violence, the NYPD tweeted a video of a brutal assault on one of their police officers, who was on anti-looting patrol in Brooklyn Wednesday. \"This was not a chance encounter -- it was a planned assassination attempt on an NYPD police officer. It's only by sheer luck that this didn't have a drastically different outcome,\" the department said in a tweet.\nNYPD RELEASES KNIFE-ATTACK VIDEO ON OFFICER: 'IT WAS A PLANNED ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT'\nIn Oregon, the Portland Police Bureau and Multnomah County Sheriff's Office also tweeted images of objects thrown at them during protests. The seemingly random objects included glass beer bottles, bricks, batteries, ball bearings, garbanzo bean cans and White Claws.\nAmid anticipated protests, Trump again tweeted \"LAW & ORDER!\" in apparent solidarity with police officers. Trump has criticized state and local officials for their alleged weakness in the face of riots, but he and others have been accused of being too harsh in response to protests about police brutality and racism.\nEarlier this week, media outlets accused Trump of tear-gassing peaceful protesters for a photo-op at St. John's Church, which was set ablaze amid protests the prior night in D.C. Park police later released a statement claiming they dispersed the protest in Lafayette Park without tear gas and because the protesters were becoming violent -- something media figures who were allegedly at the scene have disputed.\nTHOUSANDS OF PROTESTERS GATHER IN DC FOR MASSIVE GEORGE FLOYD DEMONSTRATION\nA U.S. Park Police spokesperson said Friday it was a \u201cmistake\u201d to insist in a statement Tuesday that no tear gas was used. However, the spokesperson insisted that Park Police did not lie, explicitly noting that pepper balls were shot. Pepper balls can cause irritation to the eyes and cause tears.\nTwo New York City police officers were also suspended without pay Friday after videos emerged showing them in violent confrontations with George Floyd protesters, according to reports. One video showed an officer pepper-spraying a man after pulling down the man\u2019s face mask, while the other video showed an officer throwing a woman to the ground and shouting profanity at her, BuzzFeed News reported.\nBoth protesters' and police officers' conduct has come under scrutiny as a swarm of videos have surfaced online showing physical violence between the two -- prolonging an already difficult tension that initially sparked the protests.\nProtesters are demanding that politicians implement reforms that would combat what they describe as systemic racism in the justice system. Floyd's death was just the latest in a series of high-profile incidents that activists say are indicative of a broader trend. The tension surrounding the issue has been mounting in recent years because of those police encounters and the ensuing backlash -- including NFL players kneeling during the national anthem.\nTWO NYPD OFFICERS SUSPENDED AFTER VIDEOS SHOW VIOLENCE AGAINST PROTESTERS: REPORT\nIt's unclear what policies will make it through Congress, but prominent Democrats have already lent support to sweeping reforms.\nBoth House and Senate efforts are expected to include changes to police accountability laws, such as revising immunity provisions and creating a database of police use-of-force incidents. Revamped training requirements are planned, too, among them a ban on the use of chokeholds. Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, has endorsed such a ban.\nPerhaps most notably, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., put her stamp of approval on the far-left police defunding demand as a policy solution to combat brutality and racial injustice during a congressional primary debate that aired Friday night on NY1.\nOcasio-Cortez said she's \"actively engaged in advocacy for\" a \"reduction of our NYPD budget and defunding a $6 billion NYPD budget that costs us books in the hands of our children and costs us very badly needed investment in NYCHA [New York City Housing Authority] and public housing.\"\nShe echoed the demands of the Black Lives Matter movement and police reform activists that New York City should be spending less on policing and put that money into resources that would help black communities thrive, such as education, housing and social services.\nAlso in New York, a congressional candidate, Laura Ashcraft, sent a fundraising email that read: \"F&$# THE POLICE.\"\nMALONEY CHALLENGER'S CAMPAIGN FUNDRAISING EMAIL: 'F&$# THE POLICE'\nThe Los Angeles Police Department already faces a funding cut proposal from Mayor Eric Garcetti who sought to redirect $250 million into the black community and others \"who have been left behind.\" The city is reportedly considering a figure closer to between $100 and $150 million.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nLaw enforcement leaders have ardently pushed back on the movement, claiming that it will put others in danger.\n\"I mean, so we talk about de funding, and then there's talk about dismantling in some instances, it's clearly a knee jerk reaction -- this notion that one-size-fits-all, it's flawed,\" Detroit Police Chief James Craig said during \"Cavuto Live\" on Saturday.

The biggest wave of riots occurred in 1968 following the assassination of Martin Luther King, the most prominent African-American of his day in the fight for equal rights.\nThe killing on Memorial Day this year of George Floyd, a black man unknown at the time to most Americans, sparked riots not because he was famous but because his horrific death was captured on video.

In some respects, we\u2019re reliving the 1960s and watching some of our leaders make the same mistakes an earlier generation of leaders made over 50 years ago during the last wave of rioting.\nAbout 70 percent of all Americans living today either weren't born or weren't old enough to know what was going on from 1965 to 1968. So it\u2019s useful to look back and learn from what went wrong then.\nMore from Opinion\nRep.

More and more Americans embraced \u201claw and order\u201d as a better response to the chaos. Tragically, it was residents of the riot zones \u2013 mostly African-Americans \u2013 who suffered the most.\nFive days after President Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 into law, the first major riot erupted in the Watts district of Los Angeles. It began after a California Highway Patrol officer arrested an African-American man for driving while intoxicated. Accounts vary over whether there was excessive force used when the man resisted arrest.\nSubsequent riots also occurred as a result of incidents involving the police. On July 23, 1967, after police raided an illegal after-hours bar in Detroit, the Motor City exploded. Some 2,500 businesses were looted, nearly 1,500 buildings were torched, 43 people were killed and 342 people were injured.\nPerhaps most well-remembered are the riots that followed Martin Luther King\u2019s assassination the following year. Rioting took place in more than 100 cities, including the nation\u2019s capital. Property damage in Washington alone was estimated at $27 million \u2013 more than $204 million in today\u2019s dollars.\nThe 1960s riots occurred against a backdrop of civil rights protests. African-Americans had legitimate complaints about schooling, employment discrimination and poor housing, among other concerns. Yet black people in the riot zones overwhelmingly opposed what was going on.\nIn a Harris poll taken in the aftermath of the Detroit riot, 68 percent of African-Americans surveyed characterized the looters as \u201ccriminals.\u201d The same percentage felt that violence hurt the cause of civil rights.\nMany white liberals, on the other hand, conflated the riots with civil rights protests, failing to make any distinction.\nIn a March 1969 interview, White House aide Harry McPherson \u2013 President Johnson\u2019s favorite speechwriter \u2013 recalled that the White House would issue statements denouncing rioters but adding \u201c'an apologetic 'Of course, we understand why you rioted. . ..' It was that ambivalence of the liberal.'\"\nToday\u2019s liberals seem to have lost any such ambivalence.\nYet those on the left have much to lose if Americans reject the romanticizing of violence \u2013 just as liberals lost in 1968 with the election of \u201claw-and-order\u201d Republican presidential candidate Richard Nixon.\nJust last week, President Trump said that \u201cI am the president of law and order.\u201d He no doubt hopes to ride to reelection on that label, just as Nixon was first elected 52 years ago.\nThat\u2019s why today\u2019s liberals would be wise to listen to former President Barack Obama, who wrote June 1 in the online magazine, Medium: \u201cLet\u2019s not excuse violence, or rationalize it, or participate in it. If we want our criminal justice system, and American society at large, to operate on a higher ethical code, then we have to model that code ourselves.\u201d\nOne of the saddest outcomes of riots is the destruction of small mom-and-pop businesses that have little chance of starting over. The riots of the 1960s involved the looting of at least 10,000 businesses, according to research in the African-American studies journal Phylon.\nWith the riots in the 1960s and also since Floyd\u2019s death rationalized as \u201cprotest\u201d \u2013 and the police for several days told to stand down in many communities (\u201cit is better to let them loot than shoot,\u201d the saying goes) \u2013 merchants watched as their stores were emptied and then often burned.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\nRioters were and still are in some places granted a moral holiday. Their neighbors \u2013 the merchants and their customers \u2013 are forced to pay the price.\nThen and now, store employees lost their jobs, merchants their livelihoods, and consumers the convenience of nearby places to shop. One difference today: rioters loot Walmart and torch Target \u2013 discount chains that didn\u2019t operate in black neighborhoods in the 1960s.\nCivil rights activists complained then that the \u201cpoor paid more\u201d because chain stores avoided the inner city. The looting of Target, headquartered in George Floyd\u2019s Minneapolis, is thus an ironic demonstration of the progress made in consumer choices for residents of low-income neighborhoods. But as they say, no good deed goes unpunished.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nIt\u2019s time to retire the worn-out riot ideology of the 1960s. Riots are not a form of protest; indeed, they hurt the cause of civil rights and are a source of injustice to those who suffer from the looting and arson.\nFew of those living in the midst of the riots share the easy illusions of those who hammer the unrest into a civil rights framework.

If we want to change the nature of policing, we must take the lead on that ourselves.\nIn America, the street doesn\u2019t settle or resolve this policing question, or any other public policy question. Rather, it\u2019s the hard work of study, review, debate, negotiation and accommodation. Then, we decide what is the best action.\nOne-liners on social media aren\u2019t the answer.

In the race to be heard, too many of us have given up trying to make an argument. Instead, we compete to see who can shout the loudest.\nAmerica is a place where all voices can be heard. Free speech is one of our most fundamental rights. I see legitimate protests raising important concerns, and I hear those concerns.\nBut I also see violent actors who are trying to do an end-run around public discourse.

The Wall Street Journal reported last summer on the fifth anniversary of those protests that unemployment in the St. Louis suburb was 5.5 percent compared to 3.3 percent in St. Louis County, while the poverty rate was 23 percent, compared to 10 percent in the region.\nCrime in the city is higher than in most neighboring towns and worse than in 90 percent of other U.S. cities.\nSmall-business revenue in the community, five years out, was down by roughly 50\u202fpercent.\nAnd that is in spite of considerable new investment in Ferguson.\nA devastated block of West Florissant Avenue, where the unarmed teen was shot, now hosts a new $12 million Boys and Girls Club, and the Urban League built a job training center on another burned-out block. But the bulk of new investment has gone into wealthier white neighborhoods.\nThe Washington Post reported in 2018, \u201cOf the more than $36\u202fmillion in bricks-and-mortar development that poured into the city after 2014, only $2.4\u202fmillion \u2026 has directly benefited this isolated [poor] pocket of Ferguson \u2026\u201d\nNobody will invest in neighborhoods, or cities for that matter, unless local authorities can guarantee protection from the kind of wanton destruction we have seen in recent days. And people will not move into those areas unless they feel safe. \nThe Post claimed this was the result of a \u201ccorporate mindset willing to take on only so much risk.\u201d Yes, investors will not build in a community still viewed as unsafe.\nThe Watts area of Los Angeles has a similar history. The 1965 riots that took place in that California neighborhood over six days claimed 34 lives, injured over 1,000 people and destroyed $40 million in property. The mostly black community is now mostly Hispanic, but the stats some 50 years later, stayed depressingly constant.\nAccording to the Los Angeles Daily News, writing in 2015, \u201cThe median household income is about $28,700 versus $56,266 for L.A. County households \u2026 Less than half of Watts residents over 25 graduated from high school versus 76 percent in L.A. County. And while nearly 60 percent of the neighborhood\u2019s population is eligible to be in the labor force, only half that is participating in it ...\u201d\nLike Ferguson, Watts saw a sizable inflow of capital and building after the riots devastated the city. Numerous organizations, including Bank of America and Charles Drew University, invested in Watts, but \u201curban renewal did not materialize,\u201d as one local authority noted.\nOngoing gang and street violence have stifled progress.\nNobody will invest in neighborhoods, or cities for that matter, unless local authorities can guarantee protection from the kind of wanton destruction we have seen in recent days. And people will not move into those areas unless they feel safe.\nThe task ahead is momentous. Poor and rich neighborhoods across the country have been destroyed; the damage will cost billions of dollars to repair. This wreckage comes on top of the calamity of COVID-19, which had already pummeled economic activity and crushed job growth. Our cities, just recently thought to hold the future, could be in trouble.\nMany have started to question the assumption that young people will inevitably choose urban living. That trend had been underway, denoted by data points like fewer college graduates learning to drive and sinking suburban real estate prices.\nBut now, young people are witnessing the downside of city living: because of the coronavirus, cities appear less healthy and the George Floyd riots have made them appear less safe. Mayors will inevitably raise taxes to plug deficits and to begin the clean-up, boosting the already high cost of living.\nThese are dangerous trends, which could bring cities to their knees overnight.\nThe hardship will not be evenly distributed. Most likely, the prosperous sections of Manhattan and Beverly Hills will be cleaned up within months.\nBut minority communities in Minneapolis or Los Angeles may never fully recover, and especially if the Democrat leaders in those cities continue to dumb down law enforcement and refuse to guarantee safety.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nJoe Biden never mentioned how he would restore order.

Andrew Cuomo lashed out at protesters calling to reopen the state earlier this month, saying at a news conference, \"you have no right to jeopardize my health ... and my children's health and your children's health.\" Cuomo's directives have been enforced throughout the state: A New York City tanning salon owner told Fox News he was fined $1,000 for reopening briefly last week, calling the situation \"insane\" and saying he already was \"broke.\"\nOn Friday, though, Cuomo said he \"stands\" with those defying stay-at-home orders: \"Nobody is sanctioning the arson, and the thuggery and the burglaries, but the protesters and the anger and the fear and the frustration? Yes. Yes, and the demand is for justice.\"\nIn April, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio told the Jewish community that \"the time for warnings has passed\" after he said a funeral gathering had violated social distancing guidelines. On Sunday, the mayor asserted, \"We have always honored non-violent protests.\"\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, meanwhile, had warned that in-person worship services would be a \"public-health disaster,\" disregarding constituents' concerns that he was violating their First Amendment rights. Now, his administration has been distributing masks to rioters, even though public gatherings of 10 or more are still ostensibly banned. Frey also allowed a police station to burn, saying it was necessary to protect police and rioters.\n\"The city encourages everyone to exercise caution to stay safe while participating in demonstrations, including wearing masks and physical distancing as much as possible to prevent the spread of COVID-19,\" a news release read. \"The city has made hundreds of masks available to protesters this week.\"\nThe mayor of Washington D.C., Muriel Bowser, vowed $5,000 fines or 90 days in jail for anyone violating stay-at-home orders. This weekend, though, Bowser defended the protests: \"We are grieving hundreds of years of institutional racism. ... People are tired, sad, angry and desperate for change.\" An angry mob of rioters in the city turned its rage on a Fox News crew early Saturday, chasing and pummeling the journalists outside the White House in a harrowing scene captured on video.\nNY SCRUBS CUOMO NURSING HOME ORDER LINKED TO CORONAVIRUS DEATHS\nDemonstrators standing off with police in downtown Raleigh, N.C., on Saturday, during a protest over the death of George Floyd, who died in police custody on Memorial Day in Minneapolis. (Ethan Hyman/The News &amp; Observer via AP)\nAnd, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti threatened in March to cut power and water for businesses that reopened, saying he wanted to punish \"irresponsible and selfish\" behavior. In recent days, he has encouraged mass gatherings, even as he condemned violence. \"I will always protect Angelenos' right to make their voices heard \u2014 and we can lead the movement against racism without fear of violence or vandalism,\" he said.\nThese officials were just some of the most prominent politicans to have adopted strikingly different rhetoric on mass gatherings over Floyd's death, including several protests that have triggered property damage, injuries, beatings, and several deaths. The mayor of Atlanta, Keisha Lance Bottoms, has been one of the few politicians to keep up her coronavirus admonitions. \"If you were out protesting last night, you probably need to go get a COVID test this week,\" she told CNN on Sunday. \"There is still a pandemic in America that\u2019s killing black and brown people at higher numbers.\"\nAlthough some Democrats, including Garcetti, have since welcomed the support of the National Guard to quell the demonstrations, they explicitly noted they were doing so to combat \"destruction\" and \"vandalism\" -- not widespread defiance of stay-at-home orders.\nTRUMP DESIGNATES ANTIFA A 'TERRORIST ORGANIZATION' ; SUSAN RICE SAYS RUSSIANS MAY BE BEHIND IT ALL\nFour officers have been fired in the Floyd case, and one has been arrested and charged. A video showed the arrested officer kneeling on Floyd for several minutes as he screamed that he could not breathe, although an initial medical examiner's report found \"no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation\" -- and cited Floyd's \"underlying health conditions including coronary artery disease and hypertensive heart disease,\" as well as the \"potential intoxicants\" in his system.\n\"Democratic elected officials have now all-but destroyed any remaining political deference in terms of policies needed to enforce social distancing, limit crowd size and the like,\" journalist Michael Tracey said.\nHe also suggested the protests obfuscated key data, pointing to statistics from The Washington Post showing that a total of 41 unarmed people were shot and killed by U.S. police in 2019 -- 19 of them white, nine black and nine Hispanic. Others noted that the \"Grim Reaper\" who patrolled Florida's beaches to shame swimmers and sunbathers amid the pandemic was nowhere to be seen at the protests.\n\"WE LITERALLY STAYED IN OUR HOUSES FOR A MONTH BECAUSE OF FEAR OF A VIRUS WITH A 99.74% SURVIVAL RATE AND NOW ARE SUPPOSED TO IGNORE NATIONAL COP-KILLING RIOTS?!!\" Kentucky State political science professor Wilfred Reilly tweeted. \"SERIOUS question, as re these riots - where are all these Governors that gave daily three hour press conferences about whether you could walk down the beach or visit your dying relatives? Is the COVID-19 crisis over?\"\nThere have been other indicators that officials' concerns about the coronavirus were overblown. Warnings from Democrats that the recent Wisconsin election would lead to a spike in coronavirus cases, for example, proved unfounded. (\"I don\u2019t think that the in-person election led to a major effect, to my surprise. I expected it,\u201d infectious diseases expert Oguzhan Alagoz said.)\nVideo\nReilly added: \"The way you create a narrative is to isolate and publicize every incident of the phenomenon you're focused on. Black: white/inter-racial violent crime is 5% of crime (600K cases/12M crimes), and 80% of THAT is Black on white. Wouldn't think that from the papers, wouldja?\"\nScattered efforts by the Democrats to condemn some of the protesters have relied on inaccurate information and unfounded assertions that contradict available data and video evidence. For instance, former Obama National Security Advisor Susan Rice appeared to blame the Russians for the protests on Sunday, saying the violence was right out of their \"playbook\" and that they're \"probably\" involved.\nRice also falsely claimed that Trump had called white supremacists \"very fine people,\" which has been repeatedly debunked. Like Rice, Trump specifically made a distinction between peaceful political protesters and white supremacists, whom Trump said he condemned \"totally.\" (\"Very fine people\" were protesting the censorship and removal of a Civil War statue, Trump said.)\nAnd, Frey said Saturday that officials thought \"white supremacists\" and \"out-of-state instigators\" could be behind the protests in the wake of Floyd's death, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz also claimed most of the protesters arrested were from outside Minneapolis and sought to take advantage of the chaos.\n\"We are now confronting white supremacists, members of organized crime, out of state instigators, and possibly even foreign actors to destroy and destabilize our city and our region,\" Frey had tweeted Saturday.\nHowever, a report by KARE 11 showed \"about 86 percent\" of the 36 arrests listed their address in Minnesota, and that they live in Minneapolis or the metro area, according to data the outlet analyzed from the Hennepin County Jail's roster. Five out-of-state cases came from Arkansas, Florida, Illinois, Michigan and Missouri.\nCORONAVIRUS TIMELINE SHOWS MEDIA, POLITICIANS' CHANGING RHETORIC\nSt. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter later admitted he was wrong when he falsely claimed that \"every person\" arrested in Minneapolis protests was from out of state. Frey has not issued a similar retraction, and multiple calls by Fox News to his office seeking comment were met with a busy signal. An emailed message was not immediately returned.\nOn Sunday, White House National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien disputed reports that far-right and white supremacist groups were involved in stoking the violence.\n\"I haven't seen reports of far-right groups,\" O'Brien said in an interview Sunday morning on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \"This is being driven by Antifa.\" Later Sunday, Trump announced he would designate Antifa a terrorist organization.\n\"The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization,\" Trump tweeted Sunday afternoon.\n\"It\u2019s ANTIFA and the Radical Left. Don\u2019t lay the blame on others!\" Trump had tweeted Saturday.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo was less decisive in stating who was behind the looting, arson, and violence that has taken place. While he called rioters \"Antifa-like\" during an appearance on Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" he said, \"I think it still remains to be seen exactly how\" the situation devolved from peaceful protests to something entirely different.\nFox News' Caitlin McFall, Andrew O'Reilly, Tyler Olson and Fox Business' Maria Bartiromo contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/lana-del-ray-george-floyd-looting-video-backlash", "headline": "Lana Del Rey facing backlash for posting minute-long George Floyd looting video: 'WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM'", "published_date": "2020-05-31", "text": ""}, {"url": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/chicago-george-floyd-unrest-more-fires-1968-riots", "headline": "Chicago's George Floyd unrest sees more fires than 1968 riots, report says", "published_date": "2020-06-02", "text": "Small businesses hit with looting after coronavirus shutdown\nSmall business owners grapple with riot damage; Gillian Turner reports.\nDuring weekend unrest over the death of George Floyd, Chicago firefighters battled more fires in a single night than they did during the 1968 riots, according to a report.\nFor a 24-hour period, there were more than 80 fires throughout Chicago, CBS 2 reported.

Please have respect and dignity for each other and return home.\"\nShortly after that post, Kenney retweeted the police department's message announcing the mayoral-imposed curfew.\nThe Police Department echoed Kenney's sentiment about the earlier protest at the Art Museum, but declared some of the protesters in Center City as committing \"criminal acts.\"\n\"Those acts will not be tolerated, and we strongly encourage everyone to refrain from entering Center City.
