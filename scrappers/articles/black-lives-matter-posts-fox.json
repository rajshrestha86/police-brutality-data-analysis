(AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File)\nCreation of the funds signals a growth in infrastructure for the network, which had been at odds with some local chapter organizers, who felt network leaders weren\u2019t providing enough financial support for initiatives such as rapid response to police brutality. Although there are many groups that use \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d or \u201cBLM\u201d in their names, only 16 are considered affiliates of the global network.\nFor Black Lives Matter Los Angeles, the network\u2019s first official chapter, the fund will increase its capacity to support families in need of legal aid, public communications strategy and other services after a loved one is killed by police, said organizer Melina Abdullah, who is a professor in the Pan-African Studies department at California State University, Los Angeles.\nWe\u2019ve been struggling for seven years now with very limited resources.

The wealth is being spread across younger grassroots organizations and legacy institutions, such as the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund and the National Urban League.\nThe Black Lives Matter movement emerged in 2013 amid anger over the acquittal of George Zimmerman, the Florida man who shot and killed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in 2012. The network of chapters was formed in 2014, following what organizers called Ferguson October, a national mobilization in response to the police shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.\n\u201cI\u2019m really proud of the work we\u2019ve been able to do in the last seven years,\u201d Patrisse Cullors, co-founder and chairwoman of the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, said in a statement. \u201cWhat is clear is that Black Lives Matter shares a name with a much larger movement and there are literally hundreds of organizations that do impactful racial and gender justice work who make up the fabric of this broader movement.\u201d\nThe foundation has already identified several movement organizations that it would like to support, said Cullors, who declined to name the groups. The foundation says it will \u201cprioritize mutual aid organizations, direct service and organizations focused on creating sustainable improvements in the material conditions for all black people.\u201d It also looks to support black lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender-led groups.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nOver its nearly six years of existence, the BLM Global Network had received contributions from high-profile donors, including A-list entertainers such as Jay-Z, Beyonc\u00e9 and Prince, who contributed to BLM mere weeks before his death in 2016. But unanswered questions of transparency and access to those gifts left some organizers in network affiliate chapters frustrated.\nIn January 2018, a New York City chapter announced its decision to leave the BLM Global Network, citing the need for autonomy to better serve its community. In December 2019, a different group of organizers in New York rejoined the network, Scales said.\nIn recent weeks, the BLM Global Network has had to debunk misinformation from conservative activists who claimed the group\u2019s donations were being redirected to the Democratic Party.\nThe network has also been in a tug of war with a California-based organization called the \u201cBlack Lives Matter Foundation,\u201d which has accepted donations that do not support the movement. The other group reportedly raised millions of dollars in recent weeks from small individual gifts and from employees of large corporations, such as Apple and Microsoft, who believed they were supporting the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation."}, {"url": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/black-lives-matter-dc-says-liberal-mayor-consistently-on-the-wrong-side-of-blmdc-history", "headline": "DC activists say Dem mayor 'consistently on the wrong side' of Black Lives Matters issues", "published_date": "2020-06-06", "text": "George Floyd unrest: Washington braces for massive protests\nFormer Senior Advisor to the Department of Homeland Security Charles Marino joins \u2018America\u2019s News HQ.\u2019\nProtest leaders slammed District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser for being on the \"wrong side\" of police brutality issues  and painting \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d on streets leading to the White House \u201cto appease white liberals while ignoring our demands.\u201d\n\u201cThis is a performative distraction from real policy changes.

Has their view changed since 2015?\"\nSome concrete reforms, contrary to the 2015 memo, are apparently on the way. After kneeling for several minutes, top Democrats on Monday introduced a sweeping criminal justice reform bill, which includes a limitation on police officers' qualified immunity to certain forms of lawsuits for misconduct on the job.\nCritics say qualified immunity, a judge-made doctrine, is necessary to protect police from complaints that would punish officers for reasonably executing their duties in stressful situations, or complaints intended to harass officers. Democrats charge, however, that qualified immunity is a shield for bad behavior and has enabled a culture of misconduct.\nThe \u201cJustice in Policing Act of 2020\u201d would also establish a registry of police misconduct, and would specifically allow officers to be punished for violating constitutional rights \"knowingly or with reckless disregard.\u201d The federal standard currently permits officers to be prosecuted only for \u201cwillfully\" violating constitutional rights -- a significantly higher standard of proof.\nDOJ REVEALS STRIKING RIOT ARRESTS -- INCLUDING HELICOPTER LASER STRIKE, IMPERSONATING A MARSHAL\nFurther, the federal standard for use of force would change from \u201creasonableness\u201d to situations where it is \u201cnecessary to prevent death or serious bodily injury.\u201d\nThe White House has also announced its own planned police reforms in the past week.\nThe changes come amid a tense national conversation on race and police.

The Federalist has compiled a slew of other examples.\nIn their petition addressed to the management of the Journal of Political Economy at the University of Chicago, Wolfers and other professors accuse senior editor Harald Uhlig of \"trivializing the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement\" and \"hurting and marginalizing people of color and their allies in the economics profession.\" Black Lives Matter advocates for a \"collective ownership\" economic model, reparations, and the \"immediate release\" of everyone convicted of a drug offense, in addition to defunding police forces and other left-wing agenda items.\nThe petition goes on to falsely accuse Uhlig, the Bruce Allen and Barbara Ritzenthaler Professor in Economics at the University of Chicago, of \"drawing parallels between the BLM movement and the Ku Klux Klan.\" Uhlig, in fact, was explicitly using a common form of argument known as \"reductio ad absurdum.\"\nThe New York Times' Paul Krugman, an anti-Trump columnist who has floated conspiracy theories about employment numbers and famously declared that the Internet would prove less important than fax machines, joined in on the attack, writing: \"Editor of the Journal of Political Economy, a powerful gatekeeper in the profession. And yet another privileged white man who evidently can't control his urge to belittle the concerns of those less fortunate.\"\nWolfers, who kickstarted the petition alongside Michigan State University professor Scott Imberman, further criticized Uhlig for \"disagreeing with the actions of [ex-NFL star Colin] Kaepernick.\" Liberal Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg also opposed Kaepernick's kneeling during the national anthem, but that position has now become retroactively unacceptable in progressive circles. Ginsburg specifically said Kaepernick's kneeling was both \"dumb\" and \"disrespectful.\"\nWolfers did not respond when asked by Fox News whether he would seek Ginsburg's ouster from the Supreme Court.\nPaul Krugman, who predicted the Internet would never catch on, called for a leading professor to step down for criticizing Black Lives Matter.

Endorsing Trump would be far more offensive since that would put a stamp of approval on so many offensive statements, many far more offensive than anything Uhlig has said. Would people argue that he should lose his positions if he endorsed Trump? If his tweets did result in some loss of professional status, how does that improve things in any substantive way? It would not change any attitudes nor anything in economics. It would just cause others to say nothing.\n\"My attitude is let people say stupid things, use your freedom of speech to slap them down when they do, but then get on with the business of real reform,\" Judd concluded.\nDavid Paton, an economics professor at Nottingham University Business School, added: \"Deeply disappointing to see respected economists joining in the 'cancel culture' and trying to get @haralduhlig  removed from his editorial position at JPE. Let's hope they don't succeed.\"\n\"Here is the key point,\" George Mason University economist Robin Hanson wrote. \"If you don't agree with @JustinWolfers's politics, he has no confidence in you as a social scientist. And he thinks enough other social scientists agree with him to push such folks out of the club.\"\nKRUGMAN APOLOGIZES FOR PUSHING CONSPIRACY ON JOBS REPORT\nThe drama began when Uhlig wrote on Twitter Monday night: \"Too bad, but #blacklivesmatter  per its core organization @Blklivesmatter  just torpedoed itself, with its full-fledged support of #defundthepolice.\"\nUhlig continued: \"Suuuure. They knew this is non-starter, and tried a sensible Orwell 1984 of saying oh, it just means funding schools (who isn't in favor of that?!?).But no, the so-called 'activists' did not want that.

Time for sensible adults to enter back into the room and have serious, earnest, respectful conversations about it all: e.g. policy reform proposals by @TheDemocrat  and national healing.\"\nUhlig's posts came as the movement to defund the police gained traction this week, even though polls show Americans overwhelmingly disapprove of the idea. On Monday, Minneapolis City Council President Lisa Bender told CNN that people worried about having no one to call during a home invasion were speaking from a \"place of privilege.\" Those comments drew widespread backlash.\nEXCLUSIVE VIDEO: TOP DEM ADMITS THEY PREFER TO KEEP BIDEN 'IN THE BASEMENT' \nBy way of solutions, Uhlig wrote that police need better training.\n\"Look: I understand, that some out there still wish to go and protest and say #defundpolice and all kinds of stuff, while you are still young and responsibility does not matter,\" he said. \"Enjoy! Express yourself! Just don't break anything, ok? And be back by 8 pm.\"\nSeparately, in 2017, Uhlig wrote a blog post that asked: \"Would you defend football players waving the confederate flag and dressing in Ku Klux Klan garb during the playing of the national anthem?\"\nThe post did not draw an equivalency between Black Lives Matter protesters and the KKK; instead, Uhlig took pains to mention that he was arguing only that President Trump, by criticizing players who kneel during the national anthem, was not impinging on constitutional rights.\n\"Don\u2019t get me wrong,\" Uhlig wrote in the post, apparently to no avail. \"Of course, these football players have the right to express their views about the treatment of blacks by the police, they have the right to protest President Trump and they have the right to kneel during the national anthem. Club owners have the right to fire them because of it, by the way: so Trump actually did not attack the constitutional rights of football players, but what an annoying and pesky detail, right?\"\nOPINION: ONE WAY TO REALIGN UNIVERSITY TAX INCENTIVES\n\"There are a million screeching Berkeley PhDs on Twitter, but the silent majority of economics professors aren't on Twitter  ...

(Even Wolfers had stopped short of calling Uhlig a racist.)\nAmid outcry from faculty members at left-leaning institutions, Uhlig offered something of an apology -- but it wasn't good enough for Wolfers, who called it \"a-- covering.\"\n\"I'm no fan of twitter pile-ons, or call-out culture,\" Wolfers said, despite available evidence. \"A single tweet won't get me upset. But reading through @haralduhlig 's public writing reveals a pattern that's a bit too revealing.

I don\u2019t think the profession\u2019s resolve to look more deeply into racial justice will get a fair hearing under his editorship.\"\nJennifer Doleac, an economics professor at Texas A&M University, gleefully tweeted that she hopes Uhlig won't have his job for \"much longer.\"\nDoleac didn't respond to a request for comment concerning whether she typically threatens students and colleagues with professional consequences for disagreeing with her. However, she tweeted: \"I just got an email from Fox News asking why I am trying to hurt this man's career. Folks, I don't have the power to fire him.

Now, as Democrats are confronted with a newly resurgent Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement that has led politicians to kneel in kente cloths and changed free speech norms across the country, the memo threatens to undermine their stated commitment to reform following the in-custody death of George Floyd.\n\"This document should not be emailed or handed to anyone outside of the building,\" the memo from Troy Perry, a top DCCC official, begins. \"Please only give campaign staff these best practices in meetings or over the phone.\"\nProtesters throw a statue of slave trader Edward Colston into Bristol harbor, during a Black Lives Matter protest rally in Bristol, England on Sunday.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\nAs the Black Lives Matter movement becomes an influential political force in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s death, some are now wondering if its followers -- frustrated by a two-party system that refuses to heed its calls -- could ultimately organize their own political party in the United States.\nFour years ago, 43 percent of American adults supported Black Lives Matter, according to the Pew Research Center. Today, two-thirds of U.S. adults say they support the movement and 38 percent say they strongly support it.\nWhile Democrats have sought to incorporate the movement into its party, some activists have been reluctant to do so: Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden, for example, recently ignited outrage by telling radio host Charlamagne tha God \u201cyou ain\u2019t black\u201d if you\u2019re figuring out whether to vote for him or President Trump. His comments renewed cries from African-Americans that the Democratic Party take their vote for granted.\n\u201cThat someone could be so presumptuousness, that you have to vote for a Democrat or otherwise you\u2019re not identified as Black, that is the principal reason why we need a Black party, independent, to change that kind of behavior,\u201d Robert Johnson, the founder of BET, said in a recent interview.\nSo, could Black Lives Matter mobilize into its own political party?\nWho is advocating for it? \nJohnson, the first black billionaire in the U.S., said in an interview with Fox News that he sees the need for a group to stand up with the sole purpose of fighting for African-Americans because he said the Democratic Party hasn't delivered on mending the systemic wealth gap between white and black Americans.\n\"No minority group has ever achieved significant power in a two-party system when they are locked into one party and considered unreachable by the other party,\" Johnson said.\nBET FOUNDER ROBERT JOHNSON SAYS DEMS TAKING BLACK VOTERS 'FOR GRANTED,' CALLS FOR BLM TO FORM PARTY\nJohnson said the permanent interests of African-Americans have diverged in many ways with the Democratic Party; now, with the nation behind the Black Lives Matter movement and racial injustice at the forefront, it's time to act.\n\"I propose that an independent party formed by Black Lives Matter should echo the founding principles of the original Congressional Black Caucus members in 1971 who ... said black Americans should have no permanent friends, no permanent enemies, just permanent interests,\" Johnson said.\nJohnson suggested that Black Lives Matter run candidates for various offices and leverage their power in battleground states such as Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, where black voters staying home or breaking with Democrats can determine the outcome of the presidential election. He recently publicized this idea in an open letter to the BLM movement.\nMeanwhile, Fox News\u2019 Tucker Carlson has argued the movement has already become a political party, \"maybe the strongest political party in the United States,\" after Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey was met with boos and threats to defeat him in the next election when he said, \u201cI do not support the full abolition of the police department.\u201d\nNEW YORK, USA - JUNE 24: A group of Black Lives Matter protestors congregate at City Hall across from One Police Plaza as part of the \"Defund NYPD\" and \"Occupy City Hall\" movement after spending the night on June 24, 2020 in New York City, United States. (Photo by Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)\nHow would it work? \nGetting added to the ballot differs by state, but generally requires garnering signatures on a petition. In New York state, for example, the group would need to get 15,000 voters spread out across the state to sign a petition to have one or more candidates be added to the ballot. Distribution requirements say that more than 100 voters must sign in at least 15 Congressional districts.\nTUCKER CARLSON: BLACK LIVES MATTER IS NOW A POWERFUL POLITICAL PARTY AND HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH BLACK LIVES \nIf a party garners 50,000 votes in a gubernatorial election, it can host an official convention and earns a slot on the ballot for four years and can field candidates without having to get signatures each time.\nJohnson says a Black Lives Matter Party could be used as leverage to influence the two major parties.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been convinced for a long time that 40 million African Americans who tend to vote as a bloc in one of the two parties limit their leverage in getting action form both parties,\u201d Johnson told CNBC.\n\u201cHad African American interests been embraced by one or two of the dominant parties, we wouldn\u2019t have the tremendous social, economic, racial issues that we have now,\u201d Johnson said.\nIs it likely? \nIt\u2019s still too early to tell. Black Lives Matter leaders have not publicly responded to Johnson\u2019s calls, and Fox News could not reach leadership for comment.\n\u201cThe two-party system in the U.S. is very well entrenched, and suggestions of a viable new party are unrealistic,\u201d David Hopkins, a Boston College political science professor who specializes in American politics, told Fox News. \u201cThere\u2019s already a party that favors the Black Lives Matter movement, and it\u2019s the Democratic Party.\u201d\nIn 2015, the Democratic National Committee unanimously adopted a resolution in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. But members of the movement quickly disavowed all political affiliations.\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\u201cWe do not now, nor have we ever, endorsed or affiliated with the Democratic Party, or with any party,\u201d the Black Lives Matter network said in a response posted to its Facebook page. \u201cThe Democratic Party, like the Republican and all political parties, have historically attempted to control or contain black people\u2019s efforts to liberate ourselves. True change requires real struggle, and that struggle will be in the streets and led by the people, not by a political party.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/black-lives-matter-fundraising", "headline": "Amid unrest, Black Lives Matter and other social justice groups see fundraising windfall", "published_date": "2020-06-26", "text": "Protesters camp outside NYC city hall, demand $1 billion cut to police budget\nFormer NYPD lieutenant Darrin Porcher speaks out.\nAs protests over police brutality and racial injustice have escalated in recent weeks, the mounting pressure of public opinion has led both parties in Congress to draft their own reform bills, states and local governments to tear down statues perceived as racist, places like Washington, D.C. to fast-track police reform legislation and some officials to even consider dismantling their police departments.\nWith this upheaval has come an unprecedented surge of donations to organizations and causes associated with the social justice movement, including Black Lives Matter groups and others.\nOne GoFundMe page associated with the Black Lives Matter Los Angeles chapter had been in existence since 2018 and as of the beginning of June had raised about $615,000. In less than four weeks, it's skyrocketed to over $2.4 million.\nDC PROTESTERS CONDEMN EMANCIPATION MEMORIAL IN LINCOLN PARK\nAnd The National Bail Fund Network, which essentially serves as a directory for local groups that help disadvantaged people afford bail, has seen its organizations raise more than $75 million in recent weeks, according to a spokesperson. In a three-week period, that spokesperson says, \"many individual bail funds have seen an increase of 100-200 times last year's annual fundraising amount.\"\nSome of the funds associated with the network, having their needs met for the foreseeable future by the outpouring of support, have asked people to stop giving to them and instead give to other causes.\nGoFundMe, the popular fundraising platform, has also been at the center of the movement, connecting the citizens eager to support a cause to the organizations working to change a system they see as unjust.\nA GoFundMe spokesman said that it still doesn't have a number for how much has been donated to racial justice and police reform causes, but \"we've definitely seen an outpouring of support on GoFundMe for a diverse range of causes that are focused on racial justice and equality.\"\nDC MAYOR BOWSER SAYS 'MOB' SHOULD NOT BE DECIDING WHICH STATUES FALL AS PROTESTERS EYE LINCOLN\n\"These fundraisers range from those helping the victims and families of injustice, to those supporting protestors, to those created by and for organizations focused on driving change, to those helping at the community level,\" the spokesman said.\nOne fundraiser has garnered more than $200,000 for Texas State student Gregory Arellano, whose skull was fractured by a rubber bullet during a protest in Austin, Texas, according to the fundraiser's page. Another for a bail fund associated with Black Lives Matter Charleston has pulled in more than $100,000.\nThe money isn't just coming in through GoFundMe, either. ActBlue is an online small-dollar fundraising platform used by Democratic political candidates and organizations, and other progressive groups, which collects a processing fee in exchange for providing a centralized way for these organizations to raise money.\nBetween May 28 and June 26, ActBlue processed approximately $371 million, according to the ticker on its website, for a range of candidates and causes, not just those tied to social justice groups. But while the platform doesn't break down how much went to individual groups, the death of George Floyd on May 25 in Minneapolis police custody appeared to precede an overall surge in donations. By comparison, the site processed $141 million in April and $178 million in May, which was its fifth-highest fundraising month since ActBlue was founded in 2004.\nCOULD BLACK LIVES MATTER GET ON THE BALLOT? \nThe outpouring of support has even helped those who were hurt when protests sometimes turned into riots. One GoFundMe fundraiser raised more than $1 million for a black-owned sports bar in Minneapolis that was first hurt by the coronavirus and then later looted and vandalized in late May.\nBut the fundraising windfall hasn't been without its controversies, either.\nMany people, seeking to support the Black Lives Matter movement, went onto platforms like GoFundMe and gave to the first verified charity with Black Lives Matter in the name that they could find. For many, that was the Black Lives Matter Foundation, a group based out of California whose \"mission is to help survivors and families that have suffered from the loss of a relative or loved one as a result of an unjust or questionable police shooting, and use our unique and creative ideas to help bring the police and the community closer together to save lives.\"\nBut the foundation is not affiliated with the Black Lives Matter Global Network, which is widely recognized as the official central organization for the movement.\nA Buzzfeed story first flagged the distinction. The foundation, for one, is not as aggressive on the issue of overhauling police as the Global Network, which has advocated for reducing funding for police; its official Washington, D.C. chapter has advocated to \"defund\" the police and framed the current moment as \"The Police vs The People.\"\nBLACK LIVES MATTER LEADER STATES IF US 'DOESN'T GIVE US WHAT WE WANT, THEN WE WILL BURN DOWN THE SYSTEM'\nAccording to Buzzfeed, millions had been raised for the Black Lives Matter Foundation, some of which has been frozen by platforms like GoFundMe -- as they consider diverting the funds elsewhere.\n\"GoFundMe utilizes PayPal Giving Fund's database to enable people to fundraise for a charity,\" GoFundMe said in a statement. \"180 campaigns have recently raised money for the Black Lives Matter Foundation, raising $350,000. GoFundMe placed all funds on hold and we are working with PayPal and the campaign organizers to ensure the money raised is transferred to the Black Lives Matter movement via their fiscal sponsor.\"\nFoundation leader Robert Ray Barnes confirmed that he had nothing to do with Black Lives Matter Global Network and said that, despite insinuations he's tried to take advantage of his group's name with donors, he doesn't want anyone's money \"that came to me that did not support the kinds of things that we do.\"\nHe added in a statement to Fox News: \"The overall goal of Black Lives Matter Foundation is to comprehensively improve and elevate the lives of Black and Brown people. We want the public to understand that all of Black life matters and mustn\u2019t be reduced to just Black and Brown interactions with law enforcement... Consequently, when we focus only on the interactions with the police, we lessen the importance and significance of all the other issues that require attention, or that 'matters' as it relates to the overall well-being of members of Black and Brown communities.\"\nThe Buzzfeed story quoted a Black Lives Matter Global Network spokesperson as saying Barnes' organization is \"improperly using our name.\" But Barnes' organization has existed longer than the Black Lives Matter Global Network.\nREPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: ON POLICE REFORM CONGRESS MAY HAVE MISSED ITS 'MOMENT'\nBlack Lives Matter Global Network did not respond to questions sent by Fox News for this report.\nPast IRS documents indicate that the Black Lives Matter Foundation had not spent much of the money it's raised, but Barnes says that more recently he has worked with programs in Los Angeles that help the homeless and the Peaceful Warriors Foundation in Michigan.\nAdditionally, Barnes confirmed reports that he did receive a cease and desist order for his organization from California, and said his group is \"currently working with and is in constant contact with the California Charitable Trust Section to correct the record and differentiate ourselves from the other 'for profit organizations,' which we expect to have resolved in the first couple weeks of July.\"\nThe Black Lives Matter Global Network has not escaped scrutiny. It's not technically a registered charity with the IRS, and therefore raises money through its fiscal sponsor, Thousand Currents. The Washington Examiner reported Thursday that Alicia Garza, a co-founder of the global network, has said that cop-killer Assata Shakur is an inspiration to her. And Susan Rosenberg, who sits on the board of Thousand Currents, has been convicted of domestic terrorism, though was granted clemency by former President Bill Clinton.\nAnd as with any large and unexpected influx of money to such a decentralized set of hands, there is a chance that some of it will be misspent -- though there have been no such allegations related to the rush of cash to activist groups this month.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nFor its part, The National Bail Fund Network says that money donated to its groups will be \"used to bail people out of jail as that is what bail funds do and that was clear when people donated.\"\nIts spokesperson slammed the current pretrial bail system, which it also advocates against on the grounds that it is not fair to disadvantaged populations.\n\"Our current criminal justice system incarcerates hundreds of thousands of people every year for their inability to pay money bail,\" the spokesperson said. \"As long as the pretrial detention and money bail system exist, community bail funds exist to get people free.\""}, {"url": "https://www.foxnews.com/sports/eric-reid-calls-nfl-black-lives-matter-tweet", "headline": "Eric Reid calls out NFL over 'Black Lives Matter' tweet: 'You are the system'", "published_date": "2020-06-05", "text": "Fox News Flash top headlines for June 5\nFox News Flash top headlines are here.

The episode has been widely criticized.\nDC READIES FOR SATURDAY PROTESTS AS POLICE CHIEF SAYS IT MAY BE 'LARGEST WE'VE HAD IN THE CITY'\n\u201cWhat we saw last week was basically an invasion of our city\u201d Bowser said. \u201cActive-duty Army troops moved from all points around the country to threaten our autonomy in what you saw, and I won't have it reduced to a spat on how I have to defend our taxpayers, and it's sad to say that we would have to defend ourselves against federal forces.\u201d\nVideo\nUnlike the major Washington protests of the past, Saturday's events weren't strongly organized. In some cases, they were mini-marches that began in residential neighborhoods before converging on 16th Street, one of the major roads leading to the White House, where Trump spent the day without any public appearances.\nMany protesters carried signs urging participants to vote with the passion they brought to the streets.

He then proceeded to browbeat Crews, who had committed the great sin of tweeting, \"#ALLBLACKLIVESMATTER 9 black CHILDREN killed by violence in Chicago since June 20, 2020.\" Lemon specifically objected to Crews' hashtag. After Lemon humbly informed Crews that he has skin \"as tough as an armadillo,\" he then lectured: \"The Black Lives Matter movement was started because it was talking about police brutality. ... But that's not what Black Lives Matter is about. It's not ... all-encompassing ... The Black Lives Matter movement is about police brutality and injustice in that matter, not about what's happening in Black neighborhoods.\"\nThis, of course, is largely false. The Black Lives Matter movement did indeed begin with protests about police brutality but quickly morphed into broader debates over the validity of looting and rioting, tearing down historic statues, slavery reparations and defunding the police. And Black Lives Matter, as Crews correctly pointed out, has never restricted its mandate to the question of police violence: It has announced that its focuses also include police brutality, transgender rights, gay rights, disrupting the nuclear family and freeing Palestine, among other diverse topics.\nSo why is Lemon so deeply invested in preventing conversations about Black lives? Why, in fact, do only some Black lives matter, rather than all?\nBLACK LIVES MATTER PHILADELPHIA LEADER PROPOSES FIVE-YEAR PLAN TO ABOLISH POLICE\nThat's not merely a question asked by conservatives or contrarians. It's being asked all over the United States by Black Americans being left to the predations of criminals, in large part thanks to the woke virtue signaling of many Black Lives Matter leaders and media allies. In Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser emblazoned the enormous yellow words \"BLACK LIVES MATTER\" on 16th Street. Protesters quickly added \"DEFUND THE POLICE.\" One month later, 11-year-old Davon McNeal was shot in the head while heading to a family cookout on July 4. His grandfather, John Ayala, lamented: \"We're protesting for months, for weeks, saying, 'Black Lives Matter. Black Lives Matter.' Black lives matter it seems like, only when a police officer shoots a Black person. What about all the Black-on-Black crime that's happening in the community?\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\nMcNeal was just one of the latest victims of a wave of violence gripping America's major cities. Last weekend, at least 89 people were shot in Chicago, leaving at least 17 dead. Shootings in Philadelphia have spiked 67 percent. In the first week of June, Los Angeles saw a shocking 250 percent increase in murders from the prior week. New York City's shootings have skyrocketed 44 percent over last year's numbers; every person shot there the week of June 29 -- 101 -- was from a minority community. It turns out that the agenda of Black Lives Matter, which includes fighting against the prevalence of police -- a call taken up by Democratic mayors and city councils around the United States -- endangers Black lives far more than the presence of police.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nYet these lives don't particularly matter for Black Lives Matter advocates, apparently. Black lives matter when we're talking about police brutality. But Don Lemon has no airtime each night for those who seek to talk about threats to Black lives that dwarf in severity problems related to policing -- and that are just as newsworthy. Indeed, the statistical case is unassailable that the daily murder of minority youths in America's major cities is far more newsworthy than the latest cable panel discussion of \"white fragility\" or the \"power of whiteness.\"\nBut our current Black Lives Matter moment isn't about Davon McNeal, even if the wages of Black Lives Matter's recommended policies are death for those left unprotected by law enforcement. All that matters for too many in our elite institutions is the narrative that America's systems are the greatest obstacle to Black Americans.

They forced the entire country to obey their will. It all happened so fast and with such ferocity that virtually no one resisted it.\nNAACP PRESIDENT DECLINES TO ENDORSE \u2018DEFUND POLICE\u2019 MOVEMENT\nPeople seem bewildered, even stunned by what was happening. Statements of fact and opinion that were entirely within the bounds of reasonable conversation just last Sunday, suddenly, a week later, were enough to get you fired from your job. And a number of people were fired.\nAn awful lot happened this weekend. We want to assess the aftermath of it all, suggest what it may mean, and where this country is likely to go from here.\nBut first, we want to give you a sense of what happened. We're going to begin in Minneapolis, where the Black Lives Matter riots first began almost two weeks ago.\nAs the violence there raged, some Democratic leaders in Minneapolis came to a conclusion that didn't, on the surface anyway, make intuitive sense. What their city really needs, they decided, is less law enforcement -- in fact, no law enforcement.\nSo, they began to demand that Minneapolis \"defund the police.\" Now, the first thing you notice about this idea is how unpopular with the public it is. Almost nobody in the country supports it. But the activists, undeterred, kept pushing the idea, and within days, pressure mounted on the mayor of Minneapolis, Jacob Frey, to get rid of his city's police department.\nThis was a problem for Frey. Frey has greater political aspirations. And this was the last conversation he wanted to have. So, Frey did his best to change the subject with a mix of manic enthusiasm, and feigned empathy.\nFrey is well-practiced in those areas. Here he is a couple of years ago with his preferred brand of community outreach - dancing with his constituents.\nIt didn't work -- then or now. Activists wanted actual answers. So Mayor Frey tried step two in the process -- groveling.\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey: I've been coming to grips with my own brokenness in this situation, my own failures, my own shortcomings and I know there needs to be deep-seated --\nUnidentified female: [Expletive]\nAgain, good try, \"brokenness.\" It sounds like a sermon; give a raise to the staffer who scripted that. But again, no dice. Black Lives Matter, to their credit, wanted a real answer to their question.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\nIt was then that Jacob Frey made a fatal mistake. He put himself in a position where he could be asked that question directly. Here is what happened next?\nUnidentified male: ... Reelection next year. If he says no, that's what [bleep] we're going to do next.\nUnidentified female: Yes or no, will you commit to defunding Minneapolis Police Department?\nFrey: The abolition of it?\nUnidentified female: What did I say? We don't want no more police.\nFrey: No more.\nUnidentified female: Is that clear?\nFrey: I do not support the full abolition of the police department.\nUnidentified female: [Expletive]. You're wasting our time. Get the [expletive] out of here.\nCrowd (chanting): Go home, Jacob. Go home, Jacob. Go home. Go home, Jacob. Go home. Go home, Jacob. Go home.\nWhat a remarkable piece of tape that is. Has a big city mayor in this country ever been more thoroughly humiliated? \"Get the F out of here,\" she screams. \"Go!\"\nWell, the correct answer to that, needless to say, is, \"Up yours, lady. I'm not going anywhere. I run this city.\" Do you doubt that the entire crowd would have cheered Jacob Frey if he had said that? People always admire resolve even when they disagree with the point of view. But that's not what Jacob Frey did. Frey slunk away like a child caught doing something filthy.\nThe most telling moment, though, came just before that, when the woman in sunglasses threatened to defeat the mayor in the next election. What does that tell you? It tells you that Black Lives Matter is in fact a political party, maybe the strongest political party in the United States. Its members believe they can reshape this country and so far, they're proving to be right.\nYou can always tell which political movements are ascendant, which are headed up, by how straightforward their members and sympathizers are about what they believe. Strong people say what they think out loud. They have no reason not to. They're not embarrassed about their beliefs. They think they're winning.\nIn the future, the left envisions, the only people who will have guns are people on their team, and that's exactly what defund the police really means. It means a woke militia policing our cities, enforcing Democratic Party orthodoxy.\nWith that in mind, watch this clip from CNN Monday morning. This is the president of the Minneapolis City Council, Lisa Bender. Bender explains that the desire for safety, the desire not to, for example, have your home invaded by violent criminals, is in fact a sign of racism.\nAlisyn Camerota, CNN anchor: Do you understand that the word \"dismantle\" or \"police-free\" also makes some people nervous. For instance, what if in the middle of the night, my home is broken into. Who do I call?\nLisa Bender, president of the Minneapolis City Council: Yes. I mean, I hear that loud and clear from a lot of my neighbors. And I know and myself, too, and I know that that comes from a place of privilege because for those of us for whom the system is working, I think we need to step back and imagine what it would feel like to already live in that reality, where calling the police may mean more harm is done.\n\"Hello, police? Armed men are breaking into my home. Help!\" \"Shut up, racist. Click.\" That's the world Lisa Bender is calling for.\nHow many people watching CNN this morning as they got dressed agreed with Lisa Bender? Sure, that sounds reasonable. Calling the police during a break-in definitely qualifies as racism. It's hard to believe even among CNN's audience that very many people thought that --  it's so obviously nuts.\nOn the other hand, it doesn't really matter at this point what the public thinks about anything. In the case of this idea, many Democratic leaders are already sold on it.\nHere's former congressman Keith Ellison on MSNBC over the weekend. Keep in mind as you watch him speak that Ellison is now the chief law enforcement officer in Minnesota. He is the attorney general. Ellison argues that it's wrong for police to bring guns to domestic violence calls. Seriously.\nKeith Ellison, attorney general of Minnesota: We send out people with guns, and they are there to use deadly force no matter what the problem may be.\nIf the problem is sexual assault, we send somebody with a gun. If the problem is domestic violence, we send somebody with a gun. If the problem is somebody with a mental health crisis, we send somebody with a gun.\nOkay, we know what you're thinking. That's Keith Ellison, kind of an unfair example. Ellison has long been a crazy person who was once attached to the Nation of Islam. Back then, he called himself Keith Hakeem. More recently, Ellison endorsed Antifa. Yes, that's all true.\nBut unlike other race-baiting extremists, Keith Ellison may have a promising political future. It's very easy to imagine it. If Joe Biden wins, Keith Ellison could be the attorney general of the United States. At the very least, he would be first in line to become U.S. attorney for the State of Minnesota, the top federal prosecutor there. What would happen then? We may live to find out.\nAgain, all of this probably strikes you as wild-eyed craziness, flat Earth stuff. Eliminate the police? Really? But things change fast. Look how quickly they changed just over the weekend.\nDemocrats have no intention of abolishing the police. Listen carefully and you will hear them admit that. Instead, they want to replace the police -- take the people who currently have badges, many of whom, by the way, voted for Donald Trump and swap them out for new people, people who hate Donald Trump and hate the people who voted for Donald Trump.\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who is a skilled trend spotter if there ever was one, is already acting as if defund the police -- again, a proposal that no sane person even mentioned in public just last month -- is now the defining civil rights issue of our time. You'd have to be a bigoted dinosaur, a bad person, to oppose it.\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.: This is one of those moments. This, right now, is one of those moments. So, if you're an elected official that for any reason is on this call, I'm asking you to ask yourself, what are you willing to sacrifice to make sure that overfunded police departments are defunded?\nSo think about what you just saw. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez isn't just a member of Congress. She is maybe the most famous member of Congress. She is also a surrogate for Joe Biden. So, a lot is on the line here.\nOcasio-Cortez didn't say that accidentally. She had a reason for saying it. Why did she say that? What is going on here?\nWell, as usual, the truth bears no resemblance whatsoever to what they're telling you.\nThink about it for just a second. Democratic politicians control the police departments of virtually every big city in this country. Now, they're telling you they want to get rid of those police departments. If they did, that would mean less power for themselves. So, right away, you know, there's lying going on. Democrats do not relinquish power voluntarily, ever. Period. Republicans frequently do. Democrats never do. So, that's the first thing to know.\nSomething obviously is going on here beneath the surface. This has to be an attempt to increase the power of the Democratic Party because every policy they push is always. And in fact, that's exactly what's happening here.\nDemocrats have no intention of abolishing the police. Listen carefully and you will hear them admit that. Instead, they want to replace the police -- take the people who currently have badges, many of whom, by the way, voted for Donald Trump and swap them out for new people, people who hate Donald Trump and hate the people who voted for Donald Trump. That's what's actually happening here, and it makes sense.\nLaw enforcement is one of the very few institutions remaining in this country that the left has not yet controlled. Democrats hate the police because they don't control the police. Very simple.\nRemember 35 years ago when Democrats were constantly attacking the U.S. military? We don't hear that anymore. Why is that? It's very simple. The left took over the Pentagon. No reason to attack people you control, which they do. And they plan to do the same thing to your local police department.\nLet's be clear: What Democrats are proposing isn't some form of radical libertarianism with the cops leaving citizens to police their own neighborhoods. No, it's the opposite of that. What they're proposing is a power grab.\nDefund the police is a move toward authoritarian social control, cloaked in the language of identity politics. Already, in the middle of a total breakdown of law and order as we watch our cities burn, you are seeing new moves to prevent you from defending yourself and your family in the middle of it.\nJust last Tuesday, Marjorie Greene, who is running for Congress in Georgia, posted this ad on Facebook and within two days, Facebook pulled it down.\nMarjorie Greene, running for Georgia's 14th Congressional District: I have a message for Antifa terrorists. Stay the hell out of Northwest Georgia. You won't burn our churches, loot our businesses or destroy our homes.\nHere's the new rule and it defines everything: You are not allowed to question Black Lives Matter in any way. Full stop. That rule has been enforced without mercy everywhere and not just in this country.\nSo, Facebook has a policy against violence --n not the violence engulfing our cities, but the violence of you defending your family. They create the chaos, you're not allowed to defend yourself. You are, in other words -- and this is, of course, the point -- wholly dependent upon them.\nIn the future, the left envisions, the only people who will have guns are people on their team, and that's exactly what defund the police really means. It means a woke militia policing our cities, enforcing Democratic Party orthodoxy.\nImagine if the Diversity Inclusion Department at Brown University had the power to arrest you. Imagine if the Black Lives Matter rioters had weapons and immunity from prosecution. That's what they're talking about. Partisan law enforcement and partisan law enforcement, incidentally, is hardly without precedent. In fact, it's the rule in the third world. This is an attempt to bring it here.\nWhat is again striking is how few American voters support this, very few. Polling from just a week ago shows that only 16 percent of Americans favored cutting funding to police departments. There was almost no party divide on that question surprisingly.\nThe numbers were virtually the same for Republicans and Democrats. The divide was economic.\nIf you make more than $100,000.00 a year, you are more than twice as likely to think cutting the police was a good idea. And there's no mystery there, of course; rich people live in safe places. They can afford their own security. Jeff Bezos doesn't need the police, he has got his own.\nUnfortunately for the rest of us -- and it is unfortunate --  Jeff Bezos and people like him are the only ones allowed to talk right now. It's hard to overstate how vicious the crackdown on free speech and free thought has been in the last few days.\nHere's the new rule and it defines everything: You are not allowed to question Black Lives Matter in any way. Full stop. That rule has been enforced without mercy everywhere and not just in this country.\nIn Vancouver, a men's basketball coach was fired for liking a tweet that questioned Black Lives Matter. Meanwhile, a player on the LA Galaxy -- that's the professional soccer team in Los Angeles -- was fired because his wife said something critical online. Not him, he didn't do it. His wife. It doesn't matter. They canned the player anyway.\nImagine being a high school student right now. High school students who refuse to show affirmative support for Black Lives Matter on their Instagram accounts were shunned by their friends. Journalists who asked too many questions about the group were fired or silenced. Again, not an exaggeration.\nNow, you'd think people in the media would resent this; presumably, some do. But almost everybody stayed quiet about it. They were too afraid, and some applauded.\nThe New York Times ran an op-ed demanding that people disown their own families if their families failed to support Black Lives Matter enthusiastically enough. \"Tell your relatives, tell your friends,\" the author wrote .\"You will not be visiting or answering phone calls until they take significant action in supporting black lives through protest or financial contributions.\"\nGot that? Sorry, mom. I know you're old and alone and miss your grandchildren. But we are shunning you until you send more money to Black Lives Matter.\nIn an environment like this -- we've never lived in an environment like this. But you can imagine, in an environment like this, most people get the message very fast and the weak ones are quick to join in just like the good l Red Guards they have always been underneath it all. Here's Mitt Romney on the march.\nSen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah: We need to end violence and brutality and to make sure that people understand that black lives matter.\nMitt just wants to make sure that Americans understand, get through their thick heads, that black lives matter, as if Americans didn't know that. But accusing your entire country of racism turns out to be a pretty small price for someone like Mitt Romney.\nWhat Romney is really worried about -- what all the finance moguls funding this movement are worried about -- is that someone somewhere will ask the obvious questions. How much have you, Mitt Romney personally made? How rich have you become by sending jobs overseas -- working-class jobs? By charging obscene interest rates and by otherwise harming poor and black communities economically? All the basic crimes are economic.\nMitt Romney doesn't want to talk about that at all. So he marches. And Black Lives Matter couldn't be happier about it. The complicity of people like Mitt Romney gives groups like Black Lives Matter strength.\nBlack Lives Matter is becoming more powerful by the hour and they know it. Watch this interview from Saturday in which a Black Lives Matter activist cheerfully admits he may soon incinerate people with gasoline.\nActivist: I am a leader of this FTP Movement. It means a lot of things. It can mean \"free the people.\" It can be \"for the people.\" It can also mean \"fire to property.\"\nWe hope in de Blasio and Cuomo -- come on, talk to us and give the youth some direction. But if they don't, then next up is a Diamond District, and gasoline, thanks to Trump, is awfully cheap.\nThe amazing thing is not just that he said that, though that's shocking enough. The amazing thing is that he said it on television live. He wasn't worried about being arrested.\nHe's not like you at all. You're still not allowed to attend church services or go to big weddings. Too bad you're not friends with D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser. You could do anything.\nIf this is so good for Republicans, explain this: Why does the latest round of national polls indicate that Joe Biden's lead in this race is growing?\nBowser has renamed a park near the White House \"Black Lives Matter Plaza,\" and nobody criticized her for it. MSNBC practically sent her flowers.\nJonathan Capehart, Washington Post editorial writer: Having a mural, Black Lives Matter, in huge block letters across three blocks leading up to the White House. As I said to you on Sunday, badass move that you made.\nWashington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser: The Black Lives Matter mural is a representation of an expression of our saying no, but also identifying and claiming a part of our city that had been taken over by federal forces.\nMayor Bowser was buoyed and gratified by the support she received from our friends over on MSNBC, so she also had Black Lives Matter painted in enormous yellow letters on 16th Street in downtown D.C. Kind of a bold move if you think about it, making a street partisan. Imagine a big city mayor naming a major thoroughfare NRA Avenue or Planned Parenthood Boulevard. You think they would say something about it?\nIt's impressive, in a way, but Black Lives Matter wasn't satisfied by it, not even close. The D.C. Chapter of the group released a statement attacking Mayor Bowser for not giving them complete control of the city's police department: \"This is to appease white liberals while ignoring our demands. Black Lives Matter means defund the police.\"\nGot that? Black Lives Matter means defund the police.\nOh, so that's what Black Lives Matter means. No one really explains that. That's their description, and now we know what Intel and Pepsi and Amazon are supporting when they send money -- defunding the police.\nMore from Opinion\nCal Thomas: Trump and African-Americans \u2013 these are the actions he must take now\nDonna Brazile: Justice in Policing Act \u2013 what's in this historic bill and why it must pass now\nSens. Cotton and Blackburn: Stop depending on China \u2014 here's how we end this threat\nSuddenly, it feels like all the adults have gone to St. Barts and turned off their cell phones. Who is running this country? Who is in charge? Anyone?\nYet, amazingly, some Republicans in Washington seem almost giddy as they watch the country go insane. Democrats have gone too far this time, they'll tell you. We're guaranteed to win in November. You've probably gotten texts to that effect recently from friends.\nIt sounds good, but they are wrong. They're totally and completely wrong on many levels.\nFor one thing, if you care about it, a country, you've got to try. You have an obligation to try your very best to protect and defend it, no matter who is helped in November. That's what patriotism is. It's not about you, it's about America.\nBut leave aside your moral duty, even as a matter of pure politics. This is a mindless analysis. It is a stupid calculation. Bad ideas are like cancer. When you ignore them, when you pretend they're not there, when you just assume, just ride it out, they spread.\nMost people, as we noted, currently oppose defunding the police. That's where the polls stand right now. But will they feel that way in three months? How about in three weeks? In an environment like this, you don't know. Things move fast.\nNFL Commissioner Roger Goodell once opposed mocking the American flag, kneeling to attack the country as racist. Now, Goodell has announced, he is with Black Lives Matter.\nRoger Goodell, NFL Commissioner: We at the National Football League admit we were wrong for not listening to NFL players earlier and encourage all to speak out and peacefully protest.\nWe at the National Football League believe Black Lives Matter.\nI personally protest with you.\nSo, if this is so good for Republicans, explain this: Why does the latest round of national polls indicate that Joe Biden's lead in this race is growing? And that's not a small thing if you plan to live here. If you don't want to live under Attorney General Keith Ellison, so why is it happening?\nMaybe it's because Republicans in Washington have decided to sit this crisis out. They haven't bothered to explain what's wrong. They haven't bothered to tell us anything about what might be flawed about Black Lives Matter, and they don't plan to by the way. They're too cynical. They're too fearful.\nIf Democratic leaders cared about saving the lives of black people -- and they should -- they wouldn't ignore the murder of thousands of young black men in their cities every year. They wouldn't put abortion clinics in black neighborhoods.\nThey're going to pretend like it's not happening, repeat platitudes. Read bumper stickers on the air, nod solemnly and do nothing to protect the country. Why would voters reward that?\nDemocrats, by contrast, who are completely wrong, and in fact are leading us down a path that won't end well, are not ashamed in the slightest of what they believe. Day in and day out, they brag about it. Just on Monday, they kneeled in Washington in submission before Black Lives Matter.\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi: We are here to honor George Floyd. For those who wish to, we will now kneel for our moment of silence.\nNancy Pelosi doing something crazy again.\nBefore you comfort yourself with that thought, keep in mind it wasn't just Nancy Pelosi, not by a longshot. Members of the National Guard kneeled, too. So did a group of FBI agents. So did the Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, who just the other day was wearing blackface. Now, he is with Black Lives Matter. The police chief of Webster, Massachusetts went even further than that. He lay on the ground before them in complete submission.\nAnd then things began to spin completely out of control, not just in this country but throughout the West. As the crowd swelled, and the demand for total ideological conformity grew louder, this latest cultural revolution became a parody of itself, as they always do.\nTell the truth -- and the truth is, this is a good country. Better than any other. Of course, we are flawed, but we are trying, unlike most places. And we have nothing to be ashamed of -- none of us. Immigrants know that best of all. That's why they come here -- a million new Americans every year. They're not coming because America is a racist country. They're coming because it's not.\nIn London, protesters vandalized the statue of Abraham Lincoln -- because what did Abraham Lincoln ever do for black people? In Boston, a mob defaced a monument to the first all-black volunteer regiment in the Civil War. Because black people dying to end slavery sounds like white supremacy to us.\nRight around the same time, a law professor from the University of Chicago called for an armed coup to overthrow the president of the United States, but that didn't get a lot of press because it didn't seem particularly newsworthy under the circumstances. It was that kind of weekend.\nWhat is going on? What is this about?\nEven the outlines are blurry at this point, but we know this: No matter what they tell you, it has very little to do with black lives. If only it did.\nIf Democratic leaders cared about saving the lives of black people -- and they should -- they wouldn't ignore the murder of thousands of young black men in their cities every year. They wouldn't put abortion clinics in black neighborhoods. They would instead do their very best to improve the public schools and to encourage intact families, which we know beyond a shadow of a doubt is central to the life prospects of children.\nIf they tried to make black neighborhoods as safe as their own neighborhoods, they would close the payday lenders that have added so much misery to the lives of poor people of all colors. But they don't even consider doing any of this -- they don't even try. Instead, they encourage theft and mayhem as if that will help. It will not help.\nThis may be a lot of things, this moment we're living through, but it is definitely not about black lives, and remember that when they come for you. And at this rate, they will. Anyone who has ever been subjected to the rage of the mob knows the feeling. It's like being swarmed by hornets. You cannot think clearly. And the temptation is to panic.\nVideo\nBut you can't panic.

But tragically, demands by some to defund or disband police departments around the nation will only lead to increased crime and the loss of more innocent lives, including Black lives.\nAlready, serious crime is skyrocketing in a number of cities, as criminals take advantage of attacks on police to step up their activity.\nFrom June 29 to July 5, there were 85 shooting incidents and 27 murders in Chicago alone, with most occurring on the city\u2019s predominantly African American South Side.

Far-left politicians have also joined the effort, including self-described socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who complained in late June that action by New York City to cut its police budget by $1 billion \u2014 one-sixth of the total \u2014 didn\u2019t go nearly far enough.\n\u201cDefunding police means defunding police,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said in a statement. \u201cIt does not mean budget tricks or funny math. It does not mean moving school police officers from the NYPD budget to the Department of Education\u2019s budget so the exact same police remain in schools.\u201d\nVideo\nBut radical Black Lives Matter groups \u2014 many of which have explicitly endorsed socialism \u2014 and socialist politicians like AOC are doing the exact opposite of what needs to be done to protect Black lives. If they really believe Black lives matter, they would be seeking increased funding to put more police on the street.\nCan police training and policies be improved to reduce deaths at the hands of police? Yes. Can police do a better job removing officers who resort to violence without justification from their ranks? Of course.\nWhy don\u2019t the Black lives lost to gangs and other criminals matter as much as the Black lives lost to the relatively rare cases of unjustified killings by police?\nReforming and improving the police is a laudable goal. But defunding and dismantling police departments will only make things worse and result in the deaths of more crime victims.\nShould we defund schools because some teachers have raped and assaulted their students? Should we defund hospitals because some doctors have killed patients through medical malpractice? Should we shut down churches because there are documented cases of pedophile priests and other clergy members attacking children?\nOf course not. Defunding police makes no more sense.\nWhy don\u2019t the Black lives lost to gangs and other criminals matter as much as the Black lives lost to the relatively rare cases of unjustified killings by police?\nAnd how do Black Lives Matter activists plan to keep communities safe with smaller police forces when many of these communities aren\u2019t safe now?\nBLM organizers have suggested that police pose such an incredible danger to Black families that cities would be better off without them.\nBut nearly four times more people were killed by criminals in one week (June 29 to July 5) in Chicago alone than the number of unarmed Black people who have been shot and killed by police thus far in 2020 in the entire United States \u2013 about seven.\nAll Americans should stand firmly against police brutality, racism and abuses, and support reasonable reforms like ending no-knock raids and requiring police to wear body cameras. Such reforms have been welcomed by many policymakers across the political spectrum.\nAnd of course, police who commit crimes should be treated like any other criminals \u2014      arrested and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\nBut sending out unarmed social workers and psychologists to deal with rapidly unfolding and potentially dangerous situations won\u2019t work. Armed robbers, rapists, violent gangs and other gunmen sometimes need to be confronted by armed police officers.\nIn many cases, the deterrent effect or presence of police is enough to prevent violence. But sometimes force becomes unavoidably necessary to save the lives of innocent crime victims. Imagine if your own child were in school and a gunman broke in and started shooting, killing children and teachers. Would you want a social worker or armed officers to respond? \nCalls to defund police departments so that activists can expand failing welfare programs and hire an army of social workers aren\u2019t just foolish. Such calls are incredibly dangerous and disrespectful to the families who have lost loved ones at the hands of criminals.\nBlack Lives Matter leaders have argued that crime rates would go down if poverty were reduced. They\u2019re right. Reduced poverty rates are unquestionably associated with lower crime rates, and where there is less crime there is less need for police. But reduced crime is not the same thing as zero crime.\nHowever, it would be insane to slash police budgets to the bone prior to poverty rates falling, and even more insane to think \u2014 as Black Lives Matters claims \u2014 that simply increasing funding for welfare programs would magically reduce poverty.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\nSince the start of President Lyndon Johnson\u2019s \u201cWar on Poverty\u201d more than $20 trillion has been spent on a long list of welfare programs, but poverty rates have hardly improved at all.\nSimilarly, over the past two decades poverty rates among African Americans have only decreased modestly, despite trillions in government spending on poverty programs. And much of the gains occurred only after the Trump administration and the Republican-led Congress reduced regulations and cut taxes in 2017 and 2018.\nBlack communities have been suffering for far too long with higher-than-average poverty and crime rates, but neither problem will be fixed by abolishing the only departments in many of these communities working to keep families safe \u2014 the police.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nOf course Black lives matter. The best thing we can do to show that is to focus on alleviating poverty through proven reforms like enhancing school choice, investing in job training, reforming welfare programs and helping police departments become more effective while also holding them accountable when they violate Americans\u2019 rights.\nBut none of these policies would move our country closer to socialism, so the Black Lives Matter leadership team \u2014 which is composed of numerous \u201ctrained Marxists\u201d \u2014 isn\u2019t interested. Instead, BLM leaders argue it would be better to tear down as many existing American institutions as possible, the police first among them, regardless of the consequences to Black families.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY JUSTIN HASKINS"}, {"url": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/boy-scouts-require-diversity-inclusion-merit-badge-rank-eagle-scout", "headline": "Boy Scouts to require diversity and inclusion merit badge for rank of Eagle Scout", "published_date": "2020-06-17", "text": "Fox News Flash top headlines for June 16\nFox News Flash top headlines are here.
